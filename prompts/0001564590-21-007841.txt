ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
We are a commercial-stage biotechnology company focused on improving the lives of patients by developing best-in-class treatments to address some of the most important unmet patient needs. We are developing novel, patient-focused solutions that apply our innovative science and technologies to already-approved pharmacological agents for patients suffering from pain or cancer. 
 
In August 2016, our first commercial product, SUSTOL, was approved by the FDA. SUSTOL is indicated in combination with other antiemetics in adults for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) or anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC) combination chemotherapy regimens. SUSTOL is an extended-release, injectable 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (“5-HT3”) receptor antagonist that utilizes our Biochronomer Technology to maintain therapeutic levels of granisetron for ≥5 days. We commenced commercial sales of SUSTOL in the U.S. in October 2016. 
 
In November 2017, our second commercial product, CINVANTI was approved by the FDA. In October 2019, the FDA approved our supplemental New Drug Application (“sNDA”) for CINVANTI to expand the indication and recommended dosage to include the 130 mg single-dose regimen for patients receiving moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy (“MEC”). CINVANTI, in combination with other antiemetic agents, is indicated in adults for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy (HEC) including high-dose cisplatin as a single-dose regimen, delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy (MEC) as a single-dose regimen, and nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of MEC as a 3-day regimen. CINVANTI is an intravenous (“IV”) formulation of aprepitant, a substance P/neurokinin-1 (“NK1”) receptor antagonist. We commenced commercial sales of CINVANTI in the U.S. in January 2018. In February 2019, the FDA approved our sNDA for CINVANTI, for IV use, which expanded the administration of CINVANTI beyond the initially approved administration method (a 30-minute IV infusion) to include a 2-minute IV injection.
 
HTX-019 is an investigational agent for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (“PONV”). HTX-019 is an IV injectable emulsion formulation designed to directly deliver aprepitant, the active ingredient in EMEND® (aprepitant) capsules, which is the only NK1 receptor antagonist approved in the U.S. for the prevention of PONV in adults. The FDA-approved dose of oral EMEND is 40 mg for PONV, which is given within 3 hours prior to induction of anesthesia for surgery. An Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) for HTX-019 for PONV was approved by the FDA in late September 2020. In a Phase 1 clinical trial, 32 mg of HTX-019 as a 30-second IV injection was demonstrated to be bioequivalent to oral aprepitant 40 mg. An NDA for HTX-019 is planned in late 2021 for prevention of PONV in adults.

In September 2020, our third approved product, ZYNRELEF (also known as HTX-011) was granted a marketing authorization by the European Commission (“EC”). ZYNRELEF is indicated for the treatment of somatic postoperative pain from small- to medium-sized surgical wounds in adults. ZYNRELEF, a non-opioid, is a dual-acting, fixed-dose combination of the local anesthetic bupivacaine with a low dose of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug meloxicam. It is the first and only extended-release local anesthetic to demonstrate in Phase 3 studies significantly reduced pain and opioid use through 72 hours compared to bupivacaine solution, the current standard-of-care local anesthetic for postoperative pain control. As we build large-scale manufacturing capacity to meet the anticipated commercial demand in the U.S. and the rest of the world, we are developing a coordinated global marketing strategy.
 
HTX-011 (ZYNRELEF in Europe) is an investigational agent in the U.S. and Canada. The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to HTX-011 and the New Drug Application (“NDA”) received Priority Review designation. A Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) was received from the FDA regarding the NDA for HTX-011 in June 2020. The CRL stated that the FDA is unable to approve the NDA in its present form based on the need for additional non-clinical information. Based on the complete review of the NDA, the FDA did not identify any clinical safety or efficacy issues or chemistry, manufacturing and controls issues. There are four non-clinical issues in the CRL, none of which relate to any observed toxicity. Three relate to confirming exposure of excipients in preclinical reproductive toxicology studies, and the fourth relates to changing the manufacturing release specification of the allowable level of an impurity based on animal toxicology coverage. At the Type A End-of-Review meeting in September 2020 (the “Type A Meeting”), the FDA agreed with the change to the manufacturing specification proposed by Heron to address the FDA’s concern and agreed with our proposal to bridge the clinical and nonclinical excipient exposure data to address the other 3 deficiencies. In November 2020, we resubmitted the NDA to the FDA for HTX-011 based on the outcome and final minutes of the Type A Meeting. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) goal date is May 12, 2021.
 
HTX-034, our next-generation product candidate for postoperative pain management, is an investigational non-opioid, fixed-dose combination, extended‑release solution of the local anesthetic bupivacaine, the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug meloxicam and an additional agent that further potentiates the activity of bupivacaine. HTX-034 is formulated in the same proprietary polymer as HTX-011 (ZYNRELEF in Europe). By combining two different mechanisms that each enhance the activity of the local anesthetic bupivacaine, HTX-034 is designed to provide superior and prolonged analgesia. Local administration of HTX-034 in a validated preclinical postoperative pain model resulted in sustained analgesia for 7 days. In May 2020, we initiated a Phase 1b/2 clinical study in patients undergoing bunionectomy of HTX-034. In the Phase 1b portion of this Phase 1b/2 double-blind, randomized, active-controlled, dose-escalation study in 33 patients undergoing bunionectomy, the reduction in pain intensity observed was greater with the lowest dose of HTX-034 evaluated (containing 21.7 mg of bupivacaine plus meloxicam and aprepitant) than with the bupivacaine 50 mg solution through 96 hours. In addition, 45.5% of HTX-034 patients remained opioid-free through Day 15 with median opioid consumption of 2.5 milligram morphine equivalents (same as one 5 mg oxycodone pill) through 72-hours, a 71% reduction compared to bupivacaine solution. We expect to initiate the expanded Phase 2 portion of the study for HTX-034 in the first quarter of 2021.

Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (“CINV”) Product Portfolio
 SUSTOL
 SUSTOL was our first commercial product. SUSTOL was approved by the FDA in August 2016, and we commenced commercial sales in the U.S. in October 2016.
 SUSTOL is indicated in combination with other antiemetics in adults for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) or anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC) combination chemotherapy regimens. SUSTOL is an extended-release, injectable 5-HT3 receptor antagonist that utilizes our Biochronomer Technology to maintain therapeutic levels of granisetron for ≥5 days. The SUSTOL global Phase 3 development program was comprised of two, large, guideline-based clinical studies that evaluated SUSTOL’s efficacy and safety in more than 2,000 patients with cancer. SUSTOL’s efficacy in preventing nausea and vomiting was evaluated in both the acute phase (0–24 hours following chemotherapy) and the delayed phase (24–120 hours following chemotherapy).
 SUSTOL is the first extended-release 5-HT3 receptor antagonist approved for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with both MEC and AC combination chemotherapy regimens. A standard of care in the treatment of breast cancer and other cancer types, AC regimens are among the most commonly prescribed HEC regimens, as defined by both the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (“NCCN”) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (“ASCO”). 
 In February 2017, the NCCN included SUSTOL as a part of its NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Antiemesis Version 1.2017. The NCCN has given SUSTOL a Category 1 recommendation, the highest-level category of evidence and consensus, for use in the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting in patients receiving HEC or MEC regimens. The guidelines now identify SUSTOL as a “preferred” agent for preventing nausea and vomiting following MEC. Further, the guidelines highlight the unique, extended-release formulation of SUSTOL.
 In January 2018, a product-specific billing code, or permanent J-code (“J-code”), for SUSTOL became available. The new J-code was assigned by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) and has helped simplify the billing and reimbursement process for prescribers of SUSTOL.
 CINVANTI
 CINVANTI is our second commercial product. CINVANTI was approved by the FDA in November 2017, and we commenced commercial sales in the U.S. in January 2018. In October 2019, the FDA approved our sNDA for CINVANTI to expand the indication and recommended dosage to include the 130 mg single-dose regimen for patients receiving MEC.
 CINVANTI, in combination with other antiemetic agents, is indicated in adults for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy (HEC) including high-dose cisplatin as a single-dose regimen, delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy (MEC) as a single-dose regimen, and nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of MEC as a 3-day regimen.
 CINVANTI is an IV formulation of aprepitant, an NK1 receptor antagonist. CINVANTI is the first IV formulation to directly deliver aprepitant, the active ingredient in EMEND® capsules. Aprepitant (including its prodrug, fosaprepitant) is the only single-agent NK1 receptor antagonist to significantly reduce nausea and vomiting in both the acute phase (0–24 hours after chemotherapy) and the delayed phase (24–120 hours after chemotherapy). CINVANTI is the first and only IV formulation of an NK1 receptor antagonist indicated for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with HEC and nausea and vomiting associated with MEC that is free of synthetic surfactants, including polysorbate 80.
 5

NK1 receptor antagonists are typically used in combination with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. The only other injectable NK1 receptor antagonist currently approved in the U.S. for both acute and delayed CINV, EMEND® IV (fosaprepitant), contains polysorbate 80, a synthetic surfactant, which has been linked to hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, and infusion site reactions. The CINVANTI formulation does not contain polysorbate 80 or any other synthetic surfactant. Our CINVANTI data has demonstrated the bioequivalence of CINVANTI to EMEND IV, supporting its efficacy for the prevention of both acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with HEC and nausea and vomiting associated with MEC. Results also showed CINVANTI was better tolerated in healthy volunteers than EMEND IV, with significantly fewer adverse events (“AEs”) reported with CINVANTI.
 In January 2019, a J-code for CINVANTI became available. The new J-code was assigned by CMS and has helped simplify the billing and reimbursement process for prescribers of CINVANTI.
 In February 2019, the FDA approved our sNDA for CINVANTI, for IV use, which expanded the administration of CINVANTI beyond the initially approved administration method (a 30-minute IV infusion) to include a 2-minute IV injection.
 
In July 2020, we announced the initiation of the GUARDS-1 Study, a Phase 2 clinical study evaluating CINVANTI in early hospitalized patients with COVID-19. GUARDS-1, also referred to as Study HTX-019-202, is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, Phase 2 study designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of adding daily dosing of CINVANTI for 14 days as a 2-minute intravenous injection to standard of care to reduce mortality and the need for assisted ventilation in early hospitalized adult patients with a confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (“SARS-CoV-2”) infection. The study will include up to approximately 100 adult patients who are hospitalized with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection less than 48 hours prior to randomization.
 
HTX-019 for PONV
 
HTX-019 is an investigational agent for the prevention of PONV. HTX-019 is an IV injectable emulsion formulation designed to directly deliver aprepitant, the active ingredient in EMEND capsules, which is the only NK1 receptor antagonist approved in the U.S. for the prevention of PONV in adults. The FDA-approved dose of oral EMEND is 40 mg for PONV, which is given within 3 hours prior to induction of anesthesia for surgery. An IND for HTX-019 for PONV was approved by the FDA in late September 2020. In a Phase 1 clinical trial, 32 mg of HTX-019 as a 30-second IV injection was demonstrated to be bioequivalent to oral aprepitant 40 mg. An NDA for HTX-019 is planned in late 2021 for prevention of PONV in adults.
 
Pain Management Product Portfolio
 ZYNRELEF (HTX-011)
 
ZYNRELEF, our third approved product, was granted a marketing authorization by the EC in September 2020. ZYNRELEF is indicated for the treatment of somatic postoperative pain from small- to medium-sized surgical wounds in adults. The marketing authorization follows the EMA’s positive opinion from the CHMP in July 2020. The EC’s centralized marketing authorization is valid for the 27 countries that are members of the European Union, the other countries in the European Economic Area, and the United Kingdom. ZYNRELEF, a non-opioid, is a dual-acting, fixed-dose combination of the local anesthetic bupivacaine with a low dose of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug meloxicam. It is the first and only extended-release local anesthetic to demonstrate in Phase 3 studies significantly reduced pain and opioid use through 72 hours compared to bupivacaine solution, the current standard-of-care local anesthetic for postoperative pain control. By delivering sustained levels of both a potent anesthetic and a local anti-inflammatory agent directly to the site of tissue injury, ZYNRELEF was designed to deliver superior pain relief while reducing the need for systemically administered pain medications such as opioids, which carry the risk of harmful side effects, abuse and addiction. As we build large-scale manufacturing capacity to meet the anticipated commercial demand in the U.S. and the rest of the world, we are developing a coordinated global marketing strategy. At this time, we anticipate making ZYNRELEF available to patients in Europe during 2022.

HTX-011 (ZYNRELEF in Europe) is an investigational agent in the U.S. and Canada. The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to HTX-011 and the NDA received Priority Review designation. A CRL was received from the FDA regarding the NDA for HTX-011 in June 2020. The CRL stated that the FDA is unable to approve the NDA in its present form based on the need for additional non-clinical information. Based on the complete review of the NDA, the FDA did not identify any clinical safety or efficacy issues or chemistry, manufacturing and controls issues. There are four non-clinical issues in the CRL, none of which relate to any observed toxicity. Three relate to confirming exposure of excipients in preclinical reproductive toxicology studies, and the fourth relates to changing the manufacturing release specification of the allowable level of an impurity based on animal toxicology coverage. Since receiving the CRL, we generated data showing that peak plasma levels (Cmax) of excipients in reproductive toxicology studies are >50- to >200-fold higher than the levels observed in patients receiving the highest dose of HTX-011. These results provide validation of the previously submitted animal studies. At the Type A Meeting, the FDA agreed with the change to the manufacturing specification proposed by Heron to address the FDA’s concern and agreed with our proposal to bridge the clinical and nonclinical excipient exposure data to address the other 3 deficiencies. In November 2020, we resubmitted the NDA to the FDA for HTX-011 based on the outcome and final minutes of the Type A Meeting. The PDUFA goal date is May 12, 2021. 
 In November 2019, the New Drug Submission (“NDS”) for HTX-011 was accepted by Health Canada. We are working to respond to a list of questions received from Health Canada in July 2020, and we anticipate up to a 300-day review period following our responsive submission.
 
Pivotal Phase 3 Study Results
 In March 2018, we reported positive topline results from EPOCH 1 and EPOCH 2, our pivotal Phase 3 studies of HTX-011 in bunionectomy and hernia repair, respectively. All primary and key secondary endpoints were achieved in these studies. Furthermore, HTX-011 is the only long-acting local anesthetic to demonstrate in Phase 3 studies significantly reduced pain and opioid use compared to bupivacaine solution, the current standard-of-care local anesthetic for postoperative pain control, through 72 hours. 
 The primary and key secondary endpoints for both Phase 3 studies were identical. The primary endpoint was pain intensity as measured by the Area Under the Curve (“AUC”) 0–72 compared to placebo. Key secondary endpoints in order of evaluation were: 
  
• | comparison of AUC 0–72 of pain intensity to bupivacaine solution;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the total amount of opioid rescue medication consumption compared to placebo through 72 hours after surgery;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the proportion of patients who received no opioid rescue medication after surgery compared to bupivacaine solution; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the total opioid consumption through 72 hours after surgery compared to bupivacaine solution.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Bunionectomy—Study 301/EPOCH 1 Results
 EPOCH 1 was a randomized, placebo- and active-controlled, double-blind, Phase 3 clinical study evaluating the efficacy and safety of locally administered HTX-011 at 60 mg compared to the standard dose of bupivacaine solution (50 mg) and placebo for postoperative pain control following bunionectomy surgery in 412 subjects. All primary and key secondary endpoints were achieved: 
  
• | There was a 27% reduction in pain intensity as measured by AUC 0–72 when comparing HTX-011 to placebo (p<0.0001);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | There was an 18% reduction in pain as measured by AUC 0–72 when comparing HTX-011 to bupivacaine solution (p=0.0002);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Over 72 hours post-surgery, patients receiving HTX-011 consumed 37% less opioids than placebo patients (p<0.0001) and 25% less opioids than patients receiving bupivacaine solution (p=0.0022); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | 29% of patients receiving HTX-011 required no opioid medication for 72 hours post-surgery compared to only 2% receiving placebo (p<0.0001) and 11% receiving the standard-of-care, bupivacaine solution (p=0.0001). These results parallel the significantly reduced incidence of severe pain in patients receiving HTX-011 compared to both placebo (36% reduction; p<0.0001) and bupivacaine solution (29% reduction; p<0.0001).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hernia Repair—Study 302/EPOCH 2 Results
 EPOCH 2 was a randomized, placebo- and active-controlled, double-blind, Phase 3 clinical study evaluating the efficacy and safety of locally administered HTX-011 at 300 mg compared to the standard dose of bupivacaine solution (75 mg) and placebo for postoperative pain control following hernia repair surgery in 418 subjects. All primary and key secondary endpoints were achieved: 

• | There was a 23% reduction in pain intensity as measured by AUC 0–72 when comparing HTX-011 to placebo (p=0.0004);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | There was a 21% reduction in pain as measured by AUC 0–72 when comparing HTX-011 to bupivacaine solution (p<0.0001);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Over 72 hours post-surgery, patients receiving HTX-011 consumed 38% less opioids than placebo patients (p=0.0001) and 25% less opioids than patients receiving bupivacaine solution (p=0.0240); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 51% of patients receiving HTX-011 required no opioid medication for 72 hours post-surgery compared to only 22% receiving placebo (p<0.0001) and 40% receiving the standard-of-care, bupivacaine solution (p=0.0486). These results parallel the significantly reduced incidence of severe pain in patients receiving HTX-011 compared to both placebo (40% reduction; p<0.0001) and bupivacaine solution (19% reduction; p=0.0372).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 HTX-011 was well tolerated in both Phase 3 studies, with a safety profile comparable to placebo and bupivacaine solution. There were no drug-related SAEs or discontinuations due to drug-related AEs in HTX-011-treated patients, and there were fewer opioid-related AEs in HTX-011-treated patients. 
 Fast Track Designation
 In October 2017, we were granted Fast Track designation for HTX-011 from the FDA for local administration into the surgical site to reduce postoperative pain and the need for opioid analgesics for 72 hours. Fast Track designation is intended to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new therapies to treat serious conditions with unmet medical needs by providing sponsors with the opportunity for frequent interactions with the FDA.
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
 In June 2018, we were granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for HTX-011 from the FDA for postoperative pain management. Breakthrough Therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat serious conditions and for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates substantial improvement over available therapies on clinically significant endpoint(s). Breakthrough Therapy designation was granted for HTX-011 based on the results of Phase 2 studies and two completed Phase 3 studies, which showed that HTX-011 produced significant reductions in both pain intensity and the need for opioids through 72 hours post-surgery compared to placebo and bupivacaine solution, the standard of care.

HTX-034
HTX-034, our next-generation product candidate for postoperative pain management, is an investigational non-opioid, fixed-dose combination, extended‑release solution of the local anesthetic bupivacaine, the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug meloxicam and an additional agent that further potentiates the activity of bupivacaine. HTX-034 is formulated in the same proprietary polymer as HTX-011 (ZYNRELEF in Europe). By combining two different mechanisms that each enhance the activity of the local anesthetic bupivacaine, HTX-034 is designed to provide superior and prolonged analgesia. Local administration of HTX-034 in a validated preclinical postoperative pain model resulted in sustained analgesia for 7 days.
 In May 2020, we initiated a Phase 1b/2 clinical study in patients undergoing bunionectomy of HTX-034. In the Phase 1b portion of this Phase 1b/2 double-blind, randomized, active-controlled, dose-escalation study in 33 patients undergoing bunionectomy, the reduction in pain intensity observed was greater with the lowest dose of HTX-034 evaluated (containing 21.7 mg of bupivacaine plus meloxicam and aprepitant) than with the bupivacaine 50 mg solution through 96 hours. In addition, 45.5% of HTX-034 patients remained opioid-free through Day 15 with median opioid consumption of 2.5 milligram morphine equivalents (same as one 5 mg oxycodone pill) through 72-hours, a 71% reduction compared to bupivacaine solution. We expect to initiate the expanded Phase 2 portion of the study for HTX-034 in the first quarter of 2021.
 Biochronomer Technology
 Our proprietary Biochronomer Technology is designed to deliver therapeutic levels of a wide range of otherwise short-acting pharmacological agents over a period from days to weeks with a single administration. Our Biochronomer Technology consists of polymers that have been the subject of comprehensive animal and human toxicology studies that have shown evidence of the safety of the polymer. When administered, the polymers undergo controlled hydrolysis, resulting in a controlled, sustained release of the pharmacological agent encapsulated within the Biochronomer-based composition. Furthermore, our Biochronomer Technology is designed to permit more than one pharmacological agent to be incorporated, such that multimodal therapy can be delivered with a single administration.
Sales and Marketing
 
Our U.S.-based sales and marketing team consists of 72 employees as of February 5, 2021. The sales and marketing infrastructure includes a targeted, oncology sales force to establish relationships with a focused group of oncologists, oncology nurses and pharmacists. Additionally, the sales and marketing teams manage relationships with key accounts, such as managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations, hospital systems, oncology group networks, payors and government accounts. The sales force is supported by sales management, internal sales support, an internal marketing group and distribution support. We are currently building our U.S.-based sales and marketing team to support the commercialization of HTX-011, if approved.
Customers
 CINVANTI and SUSTOL are distributed in the U.S. through a limited number of specialty distributors and full line wholesalers (collectively, “Customers”) that resell to healthcare providers and hospitals, the end users of CINVANTI and SUSTOL.

Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are extremely competitive. Our potential competitors are many in number and include major and mid-sized pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Many of our potential competitors have significantly more financial, technical and other resources than we do, which may give them a competitive advantage. In addition, they may have substantially more experience in effecting strategic combinations, in-licensing technology, developing drugs, obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing products. We cannot give any assurances that we can compete effectively with these other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Our Products compete in, and our Product Candidates and any other products that we may develop or discover, if approved, will compete in, highly competitive markets. Our potential competitors in these markets may succeed in developing products that could render our Products and our Product Candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. 
 
CINVANTI faces significant competition. NK1 receptor antagonists are administered for the prevention of CINV, in combination with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, to augment the therapeutic effect of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. Currently available NK1 receptor antagonists include: generic versions of EMEND® IV (fosaprepitant); EMEND® IV (fosaprepitant, marketed by Merck & Co); EMEND® (aprepitant, marketed by Merck & Co, Inc.); AKYNZEO® (palonosetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, combined with netupitant, an NK1 receptor antagonist, marketed by Helsinn Therapeutics); VARUBI® (rolapitant, marketed by TerSera Therapeutics LLC) and other products that include an NK1 receptor antagonist that reach the market for the prevention of CINV. 
 
If we are able to successfully develop CINVANTI for the treatment of COVID-19, we will face significant competition. At present, VEKLURY® (remdesivir, marketed by Gilead in the U.S.) is the only treatment approved for COVID-19. However, we will potentially also compete with: Bamlanivimab (a neutralizing IgG1 mAb directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, developed by AbCellera in collaboration with and marketed by Eli Lilly for the treatment and prevention of the novel coronavirus infection, and has been granted Emergency Use Authorization, globally, both alone and in combination with Estesevimab); Etesevimab (recombinant fully human monoclonal neutralizing antibody, developed by Shanghai Junshi Biosciences and marketed by Eli Lilly for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infection and has been granted Emergency Use Authorization, globally, both alone and in combination with Bamlanivimab); Casirivimab and imdevimab (a dual anti-viral antibody cocktail which developed by Regeneron (US rights) in collaboration with Roche (ex-US rights), for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, and has been granted Emergency Use Authorization, globally); tradipitant (an NK1 receptor antagonist currently under investigation by Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. pursuant to an exclusive worldwide license agreement with Eli Lilly and Company and not approved anywhere globally for any use); and potentially other products in development for the treatment of COVID-19 that reach the market.
 
SUSTOL faces significant competition. Currently available 5-HT3 receptor antagonists include: AKYNZEO® (palonosetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, combined with netupitant, an NK1 receptor antagonist, marketed by Helsinn Therapeutics (U.S.), Inc.); SANCUSO® (granisetron transdermal patch, marketed by ProStrakan Group Plc); and generic products including ondansetron (formerly marketed by GlaxoSmithKline plc as ZOFRAN), granisetron (formerly marketed by Hoffman-La Roche, Inc. as KYTRIL) and palonosetron (formerly marketed by Eisai in conjunction with Helsinn Healthcare S.A. as ALOXI). Currently, palonosetron is the only 5-HT3 receptor antagonist other than SUSTOL that is approved for the prevention of delayed CINV associated with MEC regimens. SUSTOL is indicated in combination with other antiemetics in adults for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) or anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC) combination chemotherapy regimens, which is considered to be a HEC regimen by the NCCN and ASCO. No other 5-HT3 receptor antagonist is specifically approved for the prevention of delayed CINV associated with a HEC regimen.

ZYNRELEF will, and HTX-034, if successfully developed for postoperative pain management in the EU will also, face significant competition in the EU. Currently there are numerous generic local anesthetics and other non-opioids for postoperative pain management available in the EU, and other products in development for postoperative pain management may also reach the EU market. For example, in November 2020 the EC granted a marketing authorization for EXPAREL® (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension, marketed by Pacira BioSciences, Inc. in the U.S.) for postsurgical analgesia. Pacira BioSciences, Inc. has indicated that it anticipates launching EXPAREL in the EU in the second half of 2021.
 
If we are able to successfully develop HTX-011 or HTX-034 for postoperative pain management in the U.S., we will compete with MARCAINETM (bupivacaine hydrochloride injection, solution, marketed by Pfizer Inc.) and generic forms of bupivacaine; NAROPIN® (ropivacaine, marketed by Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC) and generic forms of ropivacaine; EXPAREL® (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension, marketed by Pacira BioSciences, Inc.); Xaracoll® (bupivacaine HCl implant, marketed by Innocoll Pharmaceuticals Limited); POSIMIR® (marketed by Durect Corporation); ANJESO® (meloxicam injection, marketed by Baudax Bio, Inc.); OFIRMEV® (acetaminophen injection, marketed by Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals) and generic forms of IV acetaminophen; and potentially other products in development for postoperative pain management that reach the U.S. market.

If we are able to successfully develop HTX-019 for the treatment of PONV, we will compete with generic aprepitant, generic ondansetron, the current standard of care, and BARHEMSYS® (amisulpride, marketed by Acacia Pharma Group Plc) for the prevention and treatment of PONV; TAK-951 (a peptide agonist under development (PH2) by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited for PONV and not approved anywhere globally for any use); and potentially other products in development for PONV management that reach the market.
 Manufacturing and Clinical Supplies
 
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of commercial or clinical quantities of any product, including our Products and Product Candidates. We currently rely on a small number of third-party manufacturers to produce compounds used in our product development and commercial activities and expect to continue to do so to meet the preclinical and clinical requirements of our potential products and for all of our commercial needs. We currently have long-term commercial supply agreements with certain third-party manufacturers. Our manufacturing and processing agreements require that all third-party contract manufacturers and processors produce active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished products in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) and all other applicable laws and regulations. We maintain confidentiality agreements with potential and existing manufacturers in order to protect our proprietary rights related to our Products, our Product Candidates and our Biochronomer Technology.
 
11


Some of the critical materials and components used in manufacturing our Products and our Product Candidates are sourced from single suppliers. An interruption in the supply of a key material could significantly delay our research and development process or increase our expenses for commercialization or development of products. Specialized materials must often be manufactured for the first time for use in drug delivery technologies, or materials may be used in the technologies in a manner that is different from their customary commercial uses. The quality of materials can be critical to the performance of a drug delivery technology, so a reliable source that provides a consistent supply of materials is important. Materials or components needed for our drug delivery technologies may be difficult to obtain on commercially reasonable terms, particularly when relatively small quantities are required or if the materials traditionally have not been used in pharmaceutical products.
 Intellectual Property
 Our success will depend in large part on our ability to:
  
• | obtain and maintain international and domestic patents and other legal protections for the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | prosecute and defend our patents;
--+----------------------------------


• | preserve our trade secrets; and
--+--------------------------------


• | operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of other parties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We intend to continue to seek appropriate patent protection for the product candidates in our research and development programs and their uses by filing patent applications in the U.S. and other selected countries. We intend for these patent applications to cover, where possible, claims for composition of matter, medical uses, processes for preparation and formulations.
 
We have filed a number of U.S. patent applications on inventions relating to the composition of a variety of polymers, specific products, product groups and processing technology. As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of 31 issued U.S. patents and an additional 81 issued (or registered) foreign patents. The patents on the bioerodible technologies expire between May 2021 and March 2026. Currently, CINVANTI is covered by 7 patents issued in the U.S. with expiration dates of September 2035 and by one patent issued in Japan. Currently, SUSTOL is covered by 8 patents issued in the U.S. and by 35 patents issued in foreign countries including Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. U.S. patents covering SUSTOL have expiration dates ranging from May 2021 to September 2024; foreign patents covering SUSTOL have expiration dates ranging from May 2021 to September 2025. HTX-011 (ZYNRELEF in Europe) is protected by 11 patents issued in the U.S. and by 61 patents issued in foreign countries including Albania, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Malta, Mexico, Monaco, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey and the United Kingdom. U.S. patents covering HTX-011 have expiration dates ranging from May 2021 to April 2035; foreign patents covering HTX-011 (ZYNRELEF in Europe) have expiration dates ranging from May 2021 to April 2035. HTX-019 is covered by patents issued in the U.S. with expiration dates of September 2035 and by one patent issued in Japan. HTX-034 is protected by 8 patents issued in the U.S. and by 43 patents issued in foreign countries including Albania, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Malta, Mexico, Monaco, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey and the United Kingdom. U.S. patents covering HTX-034 have expiration dates ranging from March 2034 to April 2035; foreign patents covering HTX-034 have expiration dates ranging from March 2034 to April 2035. Our policy is to actively seek patent protection in the U.S. and to pursue equivalent patent claims in selected foreign countries, thereby seeking patent coverage for novel technologies and compositions of matter that may be commercially important to the development of our business. Granted patents include claims covering the product composition, methods of use and methods of preparation. Our existing patents 
 12

may not cover future products, additional patents may not be issued and current patents, or patents issued in the future, may not provide meaningful protection or prove to be of commercial benefit.
 
Although we believe that our rights under patent applications we own provide a competitive advantage, the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. We may not be able to develop patentable products or processes, and may not be able to obtain patents from pending applications. Even if patent claims are allowed, the claims may not issue, or in the event of issuance, may not be sufficient to protect the technology owned by or licensed to us. Any patents or patent rights that we obtain may be circumvented, challenged or invalidated by our competitors.
 
We also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek protection of these trade secrets, proprietary know-how and any continuing innovation, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. However, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for, or adequate remedies to protect, our technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of information. Furthermore, our trade secrets may otherwise become known to, or be independently developed by, our competitors.
 Government Regulation
 Pharmaceutical Regulation
 
Pharmaceutical products that we market in the U.S. are subject to extensive government regulation. Likewise, if we receive approvals to market and distribute any such products abroad, they would also be subject to extensive foreign government regulation. Compliance with these regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position to date, but new regulations or amendments to existing regulations to make them more stringent could have such an effect in the future. We cannot estimate the expenses we may incur to comply with potential new laws or changes to existing laws, or the other potential effects these laws may have on our business.
 
In the U.S., the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products. FDA regulations govern the testing, research and development activities, manufacturing, quality, storage, advertising, promotion, labeling, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products. Accordingly, there is a rigorous process for the approval of new drugs and ongoing oversight of marketed products. We are also subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing clinical trials and drug products if products are tested or marketed abroad. The approval process outside the U.S. varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and the time required may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
 Regulation in the U.S.
 The FDA testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and money. The FDA approval process for new drugs includes, without limitation:
  
• | preclinical studies;
--+---------------------


• | submission in the U.S. of an IND, for clinical trials conducted in the U.S.;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish safety and efficacy of the product;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission and review of an NDA in the U.S.; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | inspection of the facilities used in the manufacturing of the drug to assess compliance with the FDA’s current cGMP regulations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


13


The FDA monitors the progress of trials conducted in the U.S. under an IND and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend or terminate testing based on the data accumulated to that point and the FDA’s risk/benefit assessment with regard to the patients enrolled in the trial. The FDA may also place a hold on one or more clinical trials conducted under an IND for a drug if it deems warranted. Furthermore, even after regulatory approval of an NDA is obtained, under certain circumstances, such as later discovery of previously unknown problems, the FDA can withdraw approval or subject the drug to additional restrictions. We have not experienced any FDA recalls related to any of our Products.
 Preclinical Testing
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the product and animal studies to assess the potential safety and effectiveness of the product. Most of these studies must be performed according to Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”), a system of management controls for laboratories and research organizations to ensure the consistency and reliability of results. 
 An IND is the request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The IND includes information regarding the preclinical studies, the investigational product’s chemistry and manufacturing, supporting data and literature and the investigational plan and protocol(s). Clinical trials may begin 30 days after an IND is received, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trials. If concerns or questions are raised, an IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials begin. We have filed INDs in the U.S. and Clinical Trial Applications (“CTAs”) in the EU, and we may file additional INDs and CTAs in the future. We cannot assure that submission of any additional INDs or CTAs for any of our Product Candidates will result in authorization to commence clinical trials.
Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate that is the subject of the trial to volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator and in accordance with a clinical trial protocol, which sets forth details, such as the study objectives, enrollment criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved at each institution at which the study will be conducted by an independent Institutional Review Board in the U.S., referred to as an Ethics Committee in the EU and other markets or Research Ethics Board (“REB”) in Canada. The Institutional Review Board, Ethics Committee or REB (hereafter collectively referred to as “IRB”) will consider, among other things, ethical factors, safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution arising from the conduct of the proposed clinical trial. In addition, clinical trials in the U.S. and other regions must be performed according to current Good Clinical Practices, which are enumerated in FDA regulations and guidance documents. Some studies include oversight by an independent group of experts, known as a data safety monitoring board, which authorizes whether a study may move forward based on certain data from the study and may stop the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds.
 The FDA or other regulatory authorities may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it or they believe that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or it may impose other conditions.
 Clinical trials typically are conducted in sequential phases: Phases 1, 2, 3 and 4. The phases may overlap. The FDA may require that we suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including if the FDA makes a finding that the subjects participating in the trial are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 
 In Phase 1 clinical trials, the investigational product is usually tested on a small number of healthy volunteers to determine safety, any adverse effects, proper dosage, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and other drug effects. Follow-on Phase 1b clinical trials may also evaluate efficacy with respect to trial participants.
 14

In Phase 2 clinical trials, the investigational product is usually tested on a limited number of patients (generally up to several hundred) to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the drug for specific, targeted indications, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning Phase 3 clinical trials.
In Phase 3 clinical trials, the investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to confirm proof of concept and efficacy claims, provide evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple clinical sites.
In Phase 4 clinical trials or other post-approval commitments, additional studies and patient follow-up are conducted to gain experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. The FDA and other regulatory authorities may require a commitment to conduct post-approval Phase 4 studies as a condition of approval. Additional studies and follow-up may be conducted to document a clinical benefit where drugs are approved under accelerated approval regulations and based on surrogate endpoints. In clinical trials, surrogate endpoints are alternative measurements of the symptoms of a disease or condition that are substituted for measurements of observable clinical symptoms. In the U.S., failure to timely conduct Phase 4 clinical trials and follow-up could result in withdrawal of approval for products approved under accelerated approval regulations. 
 Clinical Data Review and Approval in the U.S.
 The data from the clinical trials, together with preclinical data and other supporting information that establishes a drug candidate’s safety, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA, or sNDA (for approval of a new indication if the product candidate is already approved for another indication). Under applicable laws and FDA regulations, the FDA reviews the NDA within 60 days of receipt of the NDA submission to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the FDA’s threshold determination that the NDA is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. If deemed complete, the FDA will “file” the NDA, thereby triggering substantive review of the application. The FDA can refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable. 
 The FDA has established internal substantive review goals of 10 months for most NDAs. The FDA has various programs, including Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track and Priority Review, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drug candidates, and/or provide for approval based on surrogate endpoints. Even if a drug candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Generally, drug candidates that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs to treat serious diseases and fill an unmet medical need. The request may be made at the time of IND submission and generally no later than the pre-NDA meeting. The FDA will respond within 60 calendar days of receipt of the request. Priority Review designation, which is requested at the time of an NDA submission, is designed to give drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists, an initial review within 6 months as compared to a standard review time of 10 months. Although Fast Track and Priority Review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for Priority Review. Accelerated approval provides an expedited approval of drugs that treat serious diseases and that fill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint. The FDA, however, is not legally required to complete its review within these periods, and these performance goals may change over time.

15


If the FDA approves the NDA, it will issue an approval letter authorizing the commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”), to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. In many cases, the outcome of the review, even if generally favorable, is not an actual approval, but a “complete response” that generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission, which may require substantial additional testing or information before the FDA will reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. 
 Satisfaction of FDA requirements or similar requirements of state, local and foreign regulatory agencies typically takes several years and requires the expenditure of substantial financial resources. Information generated in this process is susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval at any stage of the process. Accordingly, the actual time and expense required to bring a product to market may vary substantially. Data obtained from clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Success in early-stage clinical trials does not ensure success in later-stage clinical trials. Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages, or have conditions placed on it that restrict the commercial applications, advertising, promotion or distribution of these products.
 Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory standards are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety or effectiveness of approved products which have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these postmarketing programs. The FDA may also request or require additional Phase 4 clinical trials after a product is approved. The results of Phase 4 clinical trials can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information to augment the FDA’s voluntary adverse drug reaction reporting system. Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals would be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the drug. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements on us and our third-party manufacturers. 
 In addition, both before and after approval is sought, we are required to comply with a number of FDA requirements. For example, we are required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA, and to comply with certain limitations and other requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our products. In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with continuing cGMP. In addition, discovery of problems, such as safety problems, may result in changes in labeling or restrictions on a product manufacturer or NDA holder, including removal of the product from the market.

16


The FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs. Approval may be subject to postmarketing surveillance and other recordkeeping and reporting obligations and involve ongoing requirements. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur following initial marketing. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. 
 Clinical Trial Conduct and Product Approval Regulation in Non-U.S. Jurisdictions
 In addition to regulations in the U.S., we may be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. For example, our clinical trials conducted in the EU must be done under an Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier, and the oversight of an ethics committee. If we market our products in foreign countries, we also will be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing marketing approval for pharmaceutical products. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product approval, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained before manufacturing or marketing the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time required for such approvals may differ substantially from that required for FDA approval. There is no assurance that any future FDA approval of any of our Product Candidates will result in similar foreign approvals or vice versa. The process for clinical trials in other jurisdictions are similar, and trials are heavily scrutinized by the designated ethics committee. 
 Section 505(b)(2) Applications
 Some of our Product Candidates may be eligible for submission of applications for approval under the FDA’s Section 505(b)(2) approval process, which provides an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, and allows approval of NDAs that rely, at least in part, on studies that were not conducted by or for the applicant and to which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Such studies can be provided by published literature, or the FDA can rely on previous findings of safety and efficacy for a previously approved drug. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical studies or clinical trials of the new product. Section 505(b)(2) applications may be submitted for drug products that represent a modification (e.g., a new indication or new dosage form) of an eligible approved drug. In such cases, the additional information in 505(b)(2) applications necessary to support the change from the previously approved drug is frequently provided by new studies submitted by the applicant. Because a Section 505(b)(2) application relies in part on previous studies or previous FDA findings of safety and effectiveness, preparing 505(b)(2) applications is generally less costly and time-consuming than preparing an NDA based entirely on new data and information from a full set of clinical trials. The FDA may approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. The law governing Section 505(b)(2) or FDA’s current policies may change in such a way as to adversely affect our applications for approval that seek to utilize the Section 505(b)(2) approach. Such changes could result in additional costs associated with additional studies or clinical trials and delays.
 17

The FDA provides that reviews and/or approvals of applications submitted under Section 505(b)(2) will be delayed in various circumstances. For example, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of market exclusivity during which the FDA will not approve, and may not even review, a Section 505(b)(2) application from other sponsors. If the listed drug is claimed by one or more patents that the NDA holder has listed with the FDA, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant must submit a certification with respect to each such patent. If the 505(b)(2) applicant certifies that a listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed by the product that is the subject of the Section 505(b)(2) application, it must notify the patent holder and the NDA holder. If, within 45 days of providing this notice, the NDA holder sues the 505(b)(2) applicant for patent infringement, the FDA will not approve the Section 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of a court decision favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant or the expiration of 30 months. The regulations governing marketing exclusivity and patent protection are complex, and it is often unclear how they will be applied in particular circumstances.
 Drug Enforcement Agency Regulation
 Our research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including chemicals. Some of these hazardous materials are considered to be controlled substances and subject to regulation by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”). Controlled substances are those drugs that appear on one of 5 schedules promulgated and administered by the DEA under the Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”). The CSA governs, among other things, the distribution, recordkeeping, handling, security and disposal of controlled substances. We must be registered by the DEA in order to engage in these activities, and we are subject to periodic and ongoing inspections by the DEA and similar state drug enforcement authorities to assess ongoing compliance with the DEA’s regulations. Any failure to comply with these regulations could lead to a variety of sanctions, including the revocation, or a denial of renewal, of the DEA registration, injunctions or civil or criminal penalties.
Third-party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement
 Commercial success of our Products and our Product Candidates that are approved or commercialized for any indication will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors at the federal, state and private levels. Government payor programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health care insurance companies and managed care plans have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments. The U.S. Congress and state legislatures, from time to time, propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment. Ongoing federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of health care will likely continue to focus on health care reform, the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid payment systems. Examples of how limits on drug coverage and reimbursement in the U.S. may cause reduced payments for drugs in the future include:

• | changing Medicare reimbursement methodologies;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | fluctuating decisions on which drugs to include in formularies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | revising drug rebate calculations under the Medicaid program or requiring that new or additional rebates be provided to Medicare, Medicaid and other federal or state healthcare programs; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reforming drug importation laws.
--+---------------------------------

 Some third-party payors also require pre-approval of coverage for new drug therapies before they will reimburse health care providers that use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our current and future products and to operate profitably.

18


Reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and, within some countries, by region. Reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. In many foreign markets, including markets in which we hope to sell our Products, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government pricing control. In these markets, once marketing approval is received, pricing negotiations could take significant additional time. As in the U.S., the lack of satisfactory reimbursement or inadequate government pricing of any of our Products would limit widespread use and lower potential Product revenues.
 Anti-kickback, Fraud and Abuse and False Claims Regulation
 We are subject to health care fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of our Products and any other Product Candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our Products and any other Product Candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. 
 Regulations under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the federal health care programs’ Anti-Kickback Law, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral or purchase of any good or service for which payment may be made under federal health care programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Remuneration has been broadly defined to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced-price items and services. Many states have similar laws that apply to their state health care programs as well as private payors. In addition, the False Claims Act (“FCA”) imposes liability on persons who, among other things, present or cause to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal health care program. The FCA has been used to prosecute persons submitting claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent, that are for services not provided as claimed, or for services that are not medically necessary. Actions under the FCA may be brought by the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the FCA can result in significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the FCA, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. 
 The risk of being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Moreover, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened many of these laws. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”), among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal health care fraud statutes to clarify that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, PPACA provides that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes. 
 The continuing interpretation and application of these laws could have a material adverse impact on our business and our ability to compete in a highly competitive market. 

19


Federal and State Sunshine Laws 
 We must comply with federal and state “sunshine” laws, now known as Open Payments that require transparency regarding financial arrangements with health care providers. This would include the reporting and disclosure requirements imposed by the PPACA on drug manufacturers regarding any “payment or transfer of value” made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals. Failure to submit required information can result in civil monetary penalties. A number of states have laws that require the implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require pharmaceutical companies to track and report payments, gifts and other benefits provided to physicians and other health care professionals and entities.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1997 (“FCPA”). The FCPA and other similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from providing money or anything of value to officials of foreign governments, foreign political parties, or international organizations with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage. Recently, there has been a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity by U.S. regulators, with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the DOJ and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). A determination that our operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with U.S. or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits and other legal or equitable sanctions. Other internal or government investigations or legal or regulatory proceedings, including lawsuits brought by private litigants, may also follow as a consequence. We have a policy against using Company funds for political purposes, and we incurred no costs in 2020 associated with legal or regulatory fines or settlements associated with violations of bribery, corruption or anti-competitive standards.
Patient Privacy and Data Security
 We are required to comply, as applicable, with numerous federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health and personal information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, and to govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) became effective on January 1, 2020 and gave California residents expanded rights to access and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. Other countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information, such as the General Data Protection Regulation in the EU that became effective in May 2018 and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act that became effective in Canada in April 2000. In addition, most healthcare providers who prescribe CINVANTI, SUSTOL or who may prescribe other products we may sell in the future and from whom we may obtain patient health information are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, and its implementing regulations. We are not a HIPAA covered entity, do not intend to become one, and we do not operate as a business associate to any covered entities. Therefore, these privacy and security requirements do not apply to us. However, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain individually identifiable health information from a covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA or for aiding and abetting the violation of HIPAA. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business, including recently enacted laws in a majority of states requiring security breach notification. These laws could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business, and any failure to comply could result in harm to our reputation, and potentially fines and penalties. 
 
In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Environmental, Health and Safety Laws
 Our operations are subject to complex and increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Further, in the future, we may open manufacturing facilities that would likely be subject to environmental and health and safety authorities in the relevant jurisdictions. These authorities typically administer laws which regulate, among other matters, the emission of pollutants into the air (including the workplace), the discharge of pollutants into bodies of water, the storage, use, handling and disposal of hazardous substances, the exposure of persons to hazardous substances, and the general health, safety and welfare of employees and members of the public. Violations of these laws could subject us to strict liability, fines or liability to third parties.
Other Laws
 We are subject to a variety of financial disclosure and securities trading regulations as a public company in the U.S., including laws relating to the oversight activities of the SEC and the regulations of The Nasdaq Capital Market, on which our shares are traded. We are also subject to various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices and the experimental use of animals.
Human Capital Management
 Heron Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, Heron employed 223 full-time employees, 123 of whom are involved in research and development activities, 72 of whom are involved in sales and marketing activities and 28 of whom are involved in our administration, finance, human resources, information technology or legal functions. In 2020, Heron focused on growth to support and extend our clinical and preclinical pipeline, with hires in commercial, clinical development and operations, research, manufacturing, and general and administrative functions. Our 2020 voluntary turnover rate of 10% remains below industry norms and none of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
 
We expect to continue to add additional employees in 2021 with a particular focus on expanding our commercial capabilities. We continually evaluate the business need and opportunity and balance in-house expertise and capacity with outsourced expertise and capacity. Currently, we outsource substantial clinical study work to clinical research organizations and drug manufacturing work to contract manufacturers. 
 
Drug development is a complex endeavor that requires deep expertise and experience across a broad array of disciplines. Pharmaceutical companies both large and small compete for a limited number of qualified applicants to fill specialized positions. To attract qualified applicants to the Company, Heron offers a total rewards package consisting of base salary and annual cash bonus incentive targets aligned with the applicable market norms, a comprehensive health and welfare benefits package and equity compensation for every employee. Bonus opportunity and equity compensation increase as a percentage of total compensation based on level of responsibility. Actual bonus payout is based on a weighting of Company and individual performance, which varies based on level of responsibility.
 
Heron supports our employees’ further development with individualized development plans, mentoring, coaching, internal development workshops, and certain financial support, including company-paid external conference attendance and tuition reimbursement. Heron sponsors professional society memberships for all employees, as well as memberships for interested female employees in a women’s advocacy organization supporting women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math. 
 
Developing and maintaining a positive corporate culture is a priority for Heron. We completed our first employee satisfaction survey in late 2019 and employee satisfaction focus group discussions in 2020 to identify opportunities to enhance our corporate culture. A cross-functional team was established and worked throughout the year to identify and implement initiatives to ensure a positive, productive and inclusive work environment. This work continues as an ongoing effort.

We also monitor employee compliance with applicable laws and regulations through a third party ethics and compliance hotline system that facilitates anonymous internal and external reporting of complaints or concerns. During 2020, we received one anonymous complaint which was investigated and concluded expeditiously.  
 
Heron strives for greater diversity and inclusion through our employment and management practices, as evidenced by a recent third-party demographic analysis indicating that the diversity of our employee population reflects the ethnicity, race and gender of the overall available workforce at all job levels. Additionally, we remain committed to further increasing the diversity of our employee base. We are also building diversity in our leadership team. Currently, 40% of our Section 16 officers are female. We believe diversity is a competitive advantage and through initiatives established in our recruiting strategy and documented in our Affirmative Action Plan, we expanded our recruiting efforts in 2020 to reach a greater population of underrepresented candidates and plan to continue doing so on an ongoing basis. Heron also monitors pay practices and decisions to ensure pay equity for minority and female employees when compared to non-minority and male employees in same or similar positions and when considering objective factors related to position qualifications.  
 

Heron is committed to upholding basic human rights and complies with all laws and practices that prohibit child labor, forced or indentured labor, human trafficking and unfair wages.
 
Heron’s Injury and Illness Prevention Plan documents procedures to reduce work-related injuries and occupational illnesses. In 2020, Heron had no serious or Occupational Safety and Health Administration-reportable work-related injuries and did not experience any work-related deaths.
 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented a work from home policy for non-laboratory employees and additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work. In addition, we provided cell phone and home internet stipends to reimburse all employees for additional expenses related to working from home.
