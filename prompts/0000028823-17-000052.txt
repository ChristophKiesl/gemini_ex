SERVICE AND PRODUCT SOLUTIONS
Financial Self-Service
The Company is a leader in providing connected commerce solutions to financial institutions. These solutions are supported by a dedicated field service organization. The combination of high reliability, industry-leading security, remote management capabilities and highly-trained field technicians has made the Company a preferred choice for financial self-service (FSS) solutions. Through managed services, banks entrust the management of their automated teller machine (ATM) and security operations to the Company, allowing their associates to focus on core competencies. Furthermore, the Company’s managed services deliver greater operational efficiencies and provide financial institutions with a leading-edge solutions that they need to stay competitive in the marketplace.
A significant demand driver in the global ATM marketplace is branch automation, which helps financial institutions grow revenue, reduce costs, and increase convenience and security for the banks’ customers by migrating routine transactions, typically done inside the branch, to lower-cost automated channels. The Company serves as a strategic partner to its customers by offering a complete branch automation solution - services, software and technology - that addresses the complete value chain of consult, design, build and operate. The Company’s advisory services team collaborates with its clients to help define the ideal customer experience, modify processes, refine existing staffing models and deploy technology to meet branch automation objectives. The in-lobby teller terminal provides branch automation technology by combining the speed and accuracy of a self-service terminal with intelligence from the bank’s core systems, as well as the ability to complete higher value transactions away from the teller line.

Janus is a dual-sided self-service terminal, that features video teller access and is capable of serving two consumers simultaneously.
Retail Solutions
The Company’s retail solutions primarily consist of omni-channel retailing, store transformation and global delivery excellence. Omni-channel retailing ensures a seamless consumer experience across all consumer touchpoints. Store transformation is focused on providing leading technologies that improve consumer experience and productivity. Global delivery excellence drives operational improvements that increase efficiency while reducing costs. The Company differentiates itself by developing, delivering and operating globally integrated information technology (IT) solutions for customers and adjusting them with the help of local experts to meet customer requirements globally. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, retail solution revenues were €1,035.3 as reported using International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the European Union (EU).
Software is a key differentiator for the retail business and in this sector the Company provides a comprehensive, modular solutions platform. Click & collect, reserve & collect, in-store ordering and return to store are typical shopping processes that consumers expect retailers to be able to deliver across their footprint and digital sales channels. With TP.net, the Company offers a comprehensive software solution to improve end-to-end store processes in support of omni-channel retailing. TP.net and the other components of the TP Application Suite are designed on a modular principle and can be integrated fully or partially into existing infrastructures. Data from typical information sources such as inventories, omni-channel transactions and customer information are available at the customer touchpoints in stores, including traditional point of sale (POS) terminals and self-service checkout systems, kiosk terminals and mobile devices like tablets, as well as at enterprise functions at the retailers’ headquarters.
Retail service experts are trained to install, monitor and operate store IT solutions on a global scale and provide retail companies with full service support throughout the store’s life cycle. The service experts can install and operate multi-vendor solutions. Retailers that aim to optimize their total cost of ownership utilize the Company’s services to increase system availability. The services ensure the rapid recovery of system failures and are provided on-site by field service engineers or by means of remote maintenance. The Company also provides cash cycle management services, which ensures the availability of cash recycling systems in both the front and back-offices.

Also in the portfolio, the Company provides self-checkout terminals that ensure a consistent purchasing experience with their focus on speed, convenience and flexibility. The latest hybrid product generation can be switched from attended operation to self-checkout by the cashier with the press of a button and is thus a highly attractive solution for retailers with fluctuating store traffic throughout the day.

Brazil Other
The Company provides voting machines for official elections and the terminals for the governmental lottery and correspondent bank, which are distributed in more than 11,000 locations across Brazil. During 2015, the Company narrowed its scope in the Brazil other business to primarily focus on lottery and elections to help rationalize its solution set in that market. 
OPERATIONS
The Company’s operating results and the amount and timing of revenue are affected by numerous factors, including production schedules, customer priorities, sales volume and sales mix. During the past several years, the Company has changed the focus of its FSS business to that of a total solutions provider with a focus on services and software.
The principal raw materials used by the Company in its manufacturing operations are steel, plastics, electronic parts and components, and spare parts, which are purchased from various major suppliers. These materials and components are generally available in ample quantities.
The Company carries working capital mainly related to trade receivables and inventories. Inventories generally are only manufactured or purchased as orders are received from customers. The Company’s normal and customary payment terms generally range from 30 to 90 days from date of invoice. The Company generally does not offer extended payment terms. The Company also provides financing arrangements to customers that are largely classified and accounted for as sales-type leases. As of December 31, 2016, the Company’s net investment in finance lease receivables was $63.7.
SEGMENTS AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS
The Company’s operations are comprised of four geographic segments: North America (NA), Asia Pacific (AP), Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and Latin America (LA). The four geographic segments sell and service FSS, retail solutions and security systems around the globe through wholly-owned subsidiaries, strategic alliances, joint ventures and independent distributors in more than 130 countries.
Sales to customers outside the United States in relation to total consolidated net sales were $2,296.2 or 69.2 percent in 2016, $1,405.0 or 58.1 percent in 2015 and $1,698.9 or 62.1 percent in 2014.

Additional financial information regarding the Company’s international operations is included in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements, which is contained in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K. The Company’s non-U.S. operations are subject to normal international business risks not generally applicable to domestic business. These risks include currency fluctuation, new and different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions, political and economic changes and disruptions, tariffs or other barriers, potentially adverse tax consequences and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations.
PRODUCT BACKLOG
The Company's product backlog, was $1,060.0 and $641.1 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The backlog includes orders estimated or projected to be shipped or installed within 12 months. Although the Company believes the orders included in the backlog are firm, some orders may be canceled by customers without penalty, and the Company may elect to permit cancellation of orders without penalty where management believes it is in the Company's best interests to do so. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant cancellations within its product backlog. Additionally, over 50 percent of the Company's revenues are derived from its service business, for which backlog information is not measured. Therefore, the Company does not believe that its product backlog, as of any particular date, is necessarily indicative of revenues for any future period.
COMPETITION 
As described in more detail below, the Company participates in many highly competitive businesses in the services, software and technology space, with a mixture of local, regional and/or global competitors in its markets. In addition, the competitive environment for these types of solutions is evolving as the Company's customers are transforming their businesses utilizing innovative technology. Therefore, the Company’s product, software and service solutions must also provide cutting-edge capabilities to meet the customers emerging needs and compete with new innovators. The Company distinguishes itself by providing unique value with a wide range of innovative solutions to meet customers’ needs.
The Company believes, based upon outside independent industry surveys from Retail Banking Research (RBR), that it is an exceptional service provider for and manufacturer of self-service solutions across the globe. The Company maintains a global service infrastructure that allows it to provide services and support to satisfy its customers’ needs. Many of the Company’s customers are beginning to adopt branch automation solutions to transform their branches, which will improve the customer experience and 
6

enhance efficiency through the utilization of automated transactions, mobile solutions and other client-facing technologies. As the trend towards branch and store automation continues to build more momentum, the traditional lines of “behind the counter” and “in front of the counter” are starting to blur, which is allowing for more entrants into the market. As customer requirements evolve, separate markets will converge to fulfill new customer demand. The Company expects that this will increase the complexity and competitive nature of the business.
The Company’s competitors in the self-service market segment include global and multi-regional manufacturers and service providers, such as NCR, Nautilus Hyosung, GRG Banking Equipment, Glory Global Solutions, Oki Data and Triton Systems to a number of primarily local and regional manufacturers and service providers, including, but not limited to, Fujitsu and Hitachi-Omron in AP; Hantle/GenMega in NA; KEBA in EMEA; and Perto in LA. In addition, the Company faces competition in many markets from numerous independent ATM deployers.
In the self-service software market, the Company, in addition to the key hardware players highlighted above, competes with several smaller, niche software companies like KAL. In the managed services and outsourcing solutions market, apart from its traditional FSS competitors, the Company competes with a number of large technology competitors such as Fiserv, IBM and HP.
In the retail market, the Company, in addition to the key players highlighted above, competes with a number of large technology competitors such as MICROS, Toshiba, FEC and Cummins Allison.
In the security service and product markets, the Company competes with national, regional and local security companies. Of these competitors, some compete in only one or two product lines, while others sell a broad spectrum of security services and products. The unavailability of comparative sales information and the large variety of individual services and products make it difficult to give reasonable estimates of the Company’s competitive ranking in or share of the security market within the financial services, commercial, retail and government sectors. However, the Company believes it is a very well-positioned security service and solution provider to global, national, regional and local financial, commercial and industrial customers. 
The Company provides election systems, product solutions and support to the Brazil government. Competition in this market segment is based upon technology pre-qualification demonstrations to the Brazil government. 
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND ENGINEERING
Customer demand for FSS, retail and security technologies is growing. In order to meet this demand, the Company is focused on delivering innovation to its customers by continuing to invest in technology solutions that enable customers to reduce costs and improve efficiency. Expenditures for research, development and engineering initiatives were $110.2, $86.9 and $93.6 in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company recently announced a number of new innovative solutions, such as the new Extreme ATM™ concept, biometric-enabled solutions, responsive banking concept, the ActivEdge™ secure card reader and the world’s greenest ATM.
PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES
The Company owns patents, trademarks and licenses relating to certain products across the globe. While the Company regards these as items of importance, it does not deem its business as a whole, or any industry segment, to be materially dependent upon any one item or group of items. The Company intends to protect and defend its intellectual property, including pursuit of infringing third parties for damages and other appropriate remedies.
