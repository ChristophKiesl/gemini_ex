Item 1.    BUSINESS
Transition Period
On December 14, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved a change in the Company's fiscal year end from June 30 to December 31. In connection with this change, we previously filed a Transition Report on Form 10-K to report the results of the six-month transition period from July 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 (which we sometimes refer to as the "Transition Period"). In this Annual Report, the periods presented are the year ended December 31, 2019, the Transition Period ended December 31, 2018 and our fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 (which are referred to as “fiscal 2018,” and "fiscal 2017", as if we had not changed our fiscal year to a calendar year). For comparison purposes, we have also included unaudited data for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Overview
Immunomedics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing monoclonal antibody-based products for the targeted treatment of cancer. Our advanced proprietary technologies allow us to create humanized antibodies that can be used either alone in unlabeled or “naked” form, or conjugated with chemotherapeutics, cytokines or toxins. Our most advanced product candidate is sacituzumab govitecan ("IMMU-132"), an antibody-drug conjugate (“ADC”) that has received Breakthrough Therapy Designation (“BTD”) from the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (“mTNBC”) who previously received at least two prior therapies for metastatic disease.
Our current focus is to commercialize sacituzumab govitecan as a third-line therapy for patients with mTNBC in the United States. In May 2018, we submitted a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) to the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") for sacituzumab govitecan for the treatment of patients with mTNBC who have received at least two prior therapies for metastatic disease. In July 2018, we received notification from the FDA that the BLA was accepted for filing and the original application was granted Priority Review with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act ("PDUFA") target action date in January 2019. In January 2019, we received a Complete Response Letter ("CRL") from the FDA for the BLA. We subsequently met with the FDA in May 2019 to review the FDA’s findings and discussed our BLA resubmission. Since then, we have developed a detailed plan to address the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (“CMC”) matters raised in the CRL and in our pre-approval inspection. We held another meeting with the FDA in September 2019 to update the FDA on our progress in addressing these matters and to receive feedback from the FDA on our approach. On November 30, 2019, we resubmitted our BLA to the FDA and on December 23, 2019 we received notification from the FDA that the BLA was accepted for filing and further assigned a new PDUFA target action date as June 2, 2020. We have dedicated, and continue to commit, significant resources to address the CMC matters identified by the FDA, while, in parallel, preparing our manufacturing facility to be ready for re-inspection by the FDA. Our Phase 3 confirmatory ASCENT study for sacituzumab govitecan has reached its target enrollment for mTNBC patients previously treated with at least two systemic chemotherapy regimens. Top-line data for the ASCENT study is expected to be available around mid-2020. 
On March 29, 2019, the Company entered into a sales agreement (the "ATM Agreement") with Cowen and Company, LLC ("Cowen") to issue and sell shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to $150.0 million, from time to time during the term of the ATM Agreement, through an “at-the-market” equity offering program at the Company's sole discretion, under which Cowen will act as the Company’s agent and/or principal. The Company will pay Cowen a commission up to 3.0% of the gross sales proceeds of any common stock sold through Cowen under the ATM Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company sold 4,432,416 shares of common stock with net proceeds of $71.6 million at a weighted average price of $16.40 (excluding commissions) under the ATM Agreement. 
On April 5, 2019, the Company entered into a promotion agreement (the “Promotion Agreement”) with Janssen Biotech Inc., ("Janssen") pursuant to which the Company will provide non-exclusive product detailing services to Janssen for erdafitinib (the “Product”). Pursuant to the Promotion Agreement, the Company will provide a dedicated sales team to detail the Product to oncologists and other targeted health care providers in the United States. Under the terms of the Promotion Agreement, Janssen maintains ownership of the New Drug Application for the Product as well as legal, regulatory, distribution, commercialization and manufacturing responsibilities for the Product, while the Company will provide product detailing services to Janssen.  Following the achievement of certain sales targets in 2019 and 2020, Janssen will pay the Company (a) a service fee equal to a percentage in the low double digits of the portion of Cumulative Net Sales (as defined in the Promotion Agreement) in excess of a baseline amount during each of 2019 and 2020, and (b) potential milestone payments of up to $15.0 million when Cumulative Net Sales exceed certain thresholds during each of 2019 and 2020. On April 12, 2019, the Company was informed that the FDA granted accelerated approval to Janssen's Balversa® (erdafitinib) for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic urothelial carcinoma that has a type of susceptible genetic alteration known as FGFR3 or FGFR2, and that has progressed during or following prior platinum-containing chemotherapy. Refer to "Note 2 - Revenue Recognition" for additional information.
On April 29, 2019, we entered into a license agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Everest Medicines II Limited, a China limited company (“Everest”). Pursuant to the License Agreement, we granted Everest an exclusive license to develop and commercialize sacituzumab govitecan in the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Mongolia (the "Territory"). In consideration for entering into the License Agreement, Everest made a one-time, non-refundable upfront payment to us in the aggregate amount of $65.0 million which is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019. The License Agreement contains a development milestone payment of $60.0 million based upon our achievement of FDA approval for sacituzumab govitecan. The License Agreement also contains additional development milestone payments in a total amount of up to $180.0 million based upon the achievement of certain other development milestones. In addition, the License Agreement contains sales milestone payments in a total amount of up to $530.0 million based upon the achievement of certain sales milestones. Everest will make royalty payments to us based upon percentages of net sales of sacituzumab govitecan, ranging from 14% to 20%. Refer to "Note 2 - Revenue Recognition" for additional information.
On December 9, 2019, we closed an underwritten public offering of 14,285,715 shares of common stock at a public offering with a price of $17.50 per share, representing gross proceeds of approximately $250.0 million. In addition, the Company granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 2,142,857 additional shares of common stock for a total of 16,428,572 shares. We received gross proceeds of $287.5 million and net proceeds of $273.0 million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses related to the offering. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering primarily to accelerate commercial launch readiness, pending FDA approval, of sacituzumab govitecan in the United States in mTNBC, continue to expand the clinical development programs for sacituzumab govitecan, invest in the broader clinical development of the platform (including IMMU-130 and IMMU-140), continued scale-up of manufacturing and manufacturing process improvements, as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes.
 As of December 31, 2019, we had $613.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We believe our projected financial resources are adequate to (i) accelerate commercial launch readiness, pending FDA approval, of sacituzumab govitecan in the United States in mTNBC, (ii) continue to expand the clinical development programs for developing sacituzumab govitecan in mTNBC, metastatic urothelial cancer ("mUC"), hormone receptor-positive ("HR+")/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative ("HER2-") metastatic breast cancer ("mBC"), and other indications of high medical need, (iii) invest in the broader clinical development of the platform (including IMMU-130 and IMMU-140), (iv) continued scale up of manufacturing and manufacturing process improvements, and (v) general working capital requirements. However, in case of regulatory delays or other unforeseen events, we may require additional funding. Potential sources of funding in such a case could include (i) the entrance into potential development and commercial partnerships to advance and maximize our full pipeline for mTNBC and beyond in the United States and globally, and (ii) potential private and public capital markets financing. Refer to "Note 9 - Stockholders' Equity" for additional information. 

For 2020, our strategic priorities for sacituzumab govitecan include:

1. | FDA approval of sacituzumab govitecan for the treatment of patients with mTNBC who have received at least two prior therapies for metastatic disease under the FDA's Accelerated Approval Pathway;


2. | Commercial launch of sacituzumab govitecan, pending FDA approval, in the United States;


3. | Execution of our clinical development plan, which includes:


a. | Complete patient enrollment into registrational Phase 3 TROPiCS-02 study in HR+/HER2- mBC;


b. | Complete enrolling cisplatin-ineligible patients into cohort 2 of the pivotal Phase 2 TROPHY U-01 study in mUC and report top-line results from full 100 cohort 1 patients with prior platinum-based and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies;


c. | Include an additional exploratory cohort of patients who have relapsed or are refractory to platinum-based therapies but naïve to immuno-oncology therapies to evaluate sacituzumab govitecan in combination with pembrolizumab in the ongoing TROPHY U-01 study;


d. | Report initial results in non small cell lung cancer ("NSCLC") from the TROPiCS-03 study, a Trop-2-enriched Phase 2 multi-cohort study in refractory adeno- and squamous NSCLC, head and neck cancer, and endometrial cancer; and


e. | Report top-line results from the confirmatory Phase 3 ASCENT study in mTNBC.


4. | Establishing Samsung BioLogics Co., Ltd. as our primary source of commercial antibody in the supply chain for sacituzumab govitecan, while also investing in the scale up of our global supply chain.

Our Clinical and Preclinical Programs
We believe that our antibodies have therapeutic potential, in some cases as a naked antibody or when conjugated with chemotherapeutics, cytokines or other toxins to create unique and potentially more effective treatment options. The attachment of effective anti-tumor compounds to antibodies is intended to allow the delivery of these therapeutic agents to tumor sites with better specificity than conventional chemotherapy. This treatment method is designed to optimize the therapeutic window through reducing the systemic exposure of the patient to the therapeutic agents, which ideally minimizes debilitating side effects while maximizing the concentration of the therapeutic agent at the tumor, potentially leading to better efficacy.
Our portfolio of investigational products includes ADCs that are designed to deliver a specific payload of a chemotherapeutic directly to the tumor while reducing overall toxicities that are usually associated with conventional administration of these chemotherapeutic agents. Sacituzumab govitecan is our most advanced ADC and our lead product candidate that has received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA for the treatment of patients with mTNBC who have received at least two prior therapies for metastatic disease.
To accelerate the clinical and preclinical development of sacituzumab govitecan, we have entered into the following clinical collaborations: with AstraZeneca PLC ("AstraZeneca") to investigate sacituzumab govitecan in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor, durvalumab (Imfinzi®), in earlier lines of therapy for mTNBC, advanced urothelial cancer ("UC") and metastatic NSCLC ("mNSCLC"); with Clovis Oncology, Inc. ("Clovis") to combine sacituzumab govitecan with its poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, rucaparib (Rubraca®), in mTNBC, advanced UC and ovarian cancer; and with Roche to initiate a Phase 1b/2 study (MORPHEUS) comparing the safety and efficacy of the combination of atezolizumab (Tecentriq®) and sacituzumab govitecan as a frontline treatment for patients with metastatic or inoperable locally advanced mTNBC versus atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel as standard of care. Additionally, we have entered into a collaboration with the German Breast Group ("GBG") to conduct a multinational, post-neoadjuvant registrational Phase 3 study (SASCIA) that will evaluate sacituzumab govitecan as a treatment for newly-diagnosed breast cancer patients who do not achieve a pathological complete response ("pCR") following standard neoadjuvant therapy. 
We are also working with (i) Massachusetts General Hospital ("MGH") on a Phase 1b/2 study of sacituzumab govitecan combining with Pfizer’s PARP inhibitor, talazoparib (TALZENNA®), in patients with mTNBC previously treated with no more than one prior therapeutic regimen for metastatic disease; (ii) Yale University on a Phase 2 study of sacituzumab govitecan in patients with persistent and recurrent endometrial cancer; and (iii) the University of Wisconsin in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have progressed on second generation androgen receptor-directed therapy on a Phase 2 study. Refer to "Corporate Collaboration" and "Other Collaborations" below for additional information.
Below is our development timeline for sacituzumab govitecan across indications: 
Sacituzumab govitecan has been studied in over 1,000 cancer patients in more than 15 types of solid cancers. Sacituzumab govitecan received BTD from the FDA for the treatment of patients with mTNBC who have received at least two prior therapies for metastatic disease. The FDA has also granted sacituzumab govitecan fast track designation, designed to expedite the development and review of applications for products intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, for the same indication and for patients with NSCLC or small-cell lung cancer ("SCLC"). Sacituzumab govitecan has also been designated an orphan drug by the FDA for the treatment of patients with SCLC or pancreatic cancer and by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) for the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer.
In February 2019, updated data from the Phase 1/2 trial of sacituzumab govitecan in patients with mTNBC were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The data (from 108 subjects with mTNBC) showed an overall response rate of 33% and continue to support a favorable benefit/risk profile of the ADC in the mTNBC cohort. The confirmatory Phase 3 ASCENT study in patients with mTNBC with at least two prior therapies for metastatic disease has completed enrollment. Top-line data for the ASCENT study is expected to be available around mid-2020.
HR+/HER2- mBC is another breast cancer indication that is a key strategic focus for the Company. Phase 1/2 results of sacituzumab govitecan in this treatment-refractory cohort, a population with the distinct need for better treatment options, showed a confirmed overall response rate of 31%. Median duration of response was 7.4 months, the clinical benefit rate was 48% and median progression-free survival was 6.8 months. The safety profile in this cohort was consistent with previous reports. 
Updated results from the Phase 1/2 study of sacituzumab govitecan in the cohort of patients with previously treated mUC was presented in an oral presentation at the 2019 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium. The results showed an overall response rate of 31% and a median duration of response of 12.9 months in 45 relapsed/refractory patients. Further supportive clinical data was reported in the interim analysis of the first 35 patients from cohort 1 of the pivotal TROPHY-U-01 study and confirmed the safety and efficacy profile of sacituzumab govitecan with an overall response rate of 29% in mUC patients who progressed after both platinum-based chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.
The February 2019, New England Journal of Medicine publication also provided additional information on safety from 420 patients with a variety of epithelial cancers from the Phase 1/2 study. The adverse event profile from this overall safety population of the trial was generally consistent with those observed from various cohorts at earlier stages with low discontinuation rates and key adverse events of neutropenia, nausea and diarrhea.
With the promising efficacy and safety findings, the Company has strategically decided to broaden the development of sacituzumab govitecan beyond mTNBC by launching a Trop-2-enriched Phase 2 basket study in refractory NSCLC, head and neck cancer, and endometrial cancer.

We have an extensive intellectual property portfolio protecting sacituzumab govitecan. Specifically, 57 patents were issued in the United States and 35 foreign patents were issued covering composition of matter, synthesis and uses. Certain patents relating to the protein sequence of the hRS7 antibody used in sacituzumab govitecan expired in 2017 in the United States and will expire in 2023 overseas. Patents to compositions and use of the CL2A linker incorporated in sacituzumab govitecan expire between 2023 and 2029 in the United States and overseas. Other patents relating to methods of cancer therapy with the SN-38 conjugated form of hRS7 used in sacituzumab govitecan extend to 2033. Additionally, we are entitled to extend the term of our key patent for up to five more years in the United States and certain foreign countries. Outside the United States, patents were issued in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, Japan, Mexico, South Korea and other key global markets.
Our Platform Technologies
In our drive to improve targeted therapies of diseases, we have built significant expertise in antibody engineering, particularly proprietary complementarity determining region (CDR)-grafting (antibody humanization) methods, antibody production and formulation, immunochemistry, molecular biology, antibody conjugation, peptide chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and protein engineering.
Beginning with our unique grafting technique to engineer humanized antibodies, our antibody humanization platform has produced a diverse portfolio of therapeutic agents that are well tolerated and also have a low incidence of immunogenicity.
With the successful humanized antibody platform as a foundation, we have built a robust ADC program using our own proprietary ADC linker technology. 
ADC Linker Technology
We developed a novel ADC platform using our proprietary linker, CL2A, which was designed with targeted delivery of SN-38 in mind. SN-38 is about 3 orders of magnitude (100 to 1,000 times) more potent than irinotecan, its parent drug, but it cannot be administered systemically to patients because of its poor water solubility and toxicity. Our linker, CL2A, allows us to produce SN-38 conjugates that are soluble in water with excellent yields while preserving antibody binding and drug activity.
CL2A contains an antibody coupling group on one end and a chemical group on the other for binding with a drug. We have also added a short polyethylene glycol to improve the solubility of CL2A.
Furthermore, because SN-38 can be converted from its active lactone form to the inactive carboxylate form, CL2A was designed to attach close to the lactone ring to prevent it from opening up, thereby maintaining the activity of SN-38. Another key feature of our ADC platform is that the linkage between CL2A and SN-38 is hydrolyzable and will allow the detachment of SN-38 at a rate of about 50% per day in vivo.
The final structure of our ADC is depicted below, with the hydrolysable linker indicated. What differentiates our ADC platform from those of other companies is the high drug-to-antibody ratio of about seven to eight molecules of drug per antibody. That is to say, when our ADCs bind to their targets on cancer cells, they are delivering up to eight molecules of SN-38 per antibody molecule into the blood or at the vicinity of the tumor, which may explain why our ADCs can deliver more than 120-times the amount of SN-38 to the tumor when studied in an animal model, as compared to irinotecan, the parent compound. We can deliver this drug concentration because our drug is not supertoxic, thus permitting us to give higher antibody doses, in repeated therapy cycles, that we believe provide a better therapeutic index. 
Patents and Proprietary Rights

Our Trade Secrets
We also rely upon unpatented trade secrets, and there is no assurance that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology, or that such rights can be meaningfully protected. We require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisers to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual's relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the agreement provides that all inventions conceived by such employees shall be our exclusive property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
Third Party Rights
Our success also depends in part on our ability to gain access to third party patent and proprietary rights and to operate our business without infringing on third party patent rights. We may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights from third parties to develop, manufacture and commercialize our product candidates. Licenses required under third-party patents or proprietary rights may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we do not obtain the required licenses, we could encounter delays in product development while we attempt to redesign products or methods or we could be unable to develop, manufacture or sell products requiring these licenses at all.
Corporate Collaborations
AstraZeneca/MedImmune
In June 2018, we entered into a clinical collaboration with AstraZeneca and its global biologics research and development arm, MedImmune, to evaluate in Phase 1/2 studies the safety and efficacy of combining AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi® (durvalumab), a human monoclonal antibody directed against programmed cell death ligand 1 ("PD-L1"), with sacituzumab govitecan as a treatment of patients with TNBC and UC, which was broadened in October 2018 to include second-line mNSCLC. 
Part one of the two-part Phase 1/2 studies will be co-funded by the two companies. Immunomedics will supply the study drug and AstraZeneca will utilize its existing clinical trial infrastructure to accelerate the enrollment of the sacituzumab govitecan and durvalumab combination. The trial design allows for rapid transition into randomized Phase 2 studies should the first part of these studies show promising data and the companies agree to proceed based on efficacy and safety results obtained. 
Clovis Oncology
In June 2018, we signed a letter of intent with Clovis, and in December 2018, we entered into a clinical collaboration to investigate the combination of Clovis’ Rubraca® (rucaparib), a poly (ADP ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi), and sacituzumab govitecan as a second-line treatment of patients with mTNBC and mUC in a phase 1/2 study (SEASTAR), which has been expanded to include platinum resistant ovarian cancer. The dose escalation phase of the study is currently enrolling patients.

GBG Forschungs GmbH
In September 2019, we entered into a clinical collaboration with GBG, Neu-Isenburg, Germany, to develop sacituzumab govitecan as a treatment for newly-diagnosed breast cancer patients who do not achieve a pCR following standard neoadjuvant therapy.
The multinational, post-neoadjuvant Phase 3 SASCIA study developed by GBG will be conducted under the sponsorship of GBG. Approximately 1,200 high-risk patients with newly-diagnosed HER2- breast cancer not achieving a pCR following standard neoadjuvant therapy will be randomized to receive either sacituzumab govitecan or treatment of physician’s choice. Primary endpoint is invasive disease-free survival with overall survival, patient reported outcome/quality of life, circulating tumor DNA clearance, and safety serving as secondary endpoints.
Under the terms of the agreement, GBG is eligible to receive up to €33.0 million in potential clinical and regulatory milestone payments over a span of approximately six years, of which €0.5 million was paid during the year ended December 31, 2019. 
F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd
In September 2019, we entered into a clinical collaboration with F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd ("Roche") to compare the safety and efficacy of the combination of atezolizumab (Tecentriq®), a programmed cell death ligand 1 blocking checkpoint inhibitor, and sacituzumab govitecan, as a frontline treatment of patients with metastatic or inoperable locally advanced TNBC versus atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel as standard of care. Roche will be responsible for conducting the randomized trial.
Other Collaborations
    
In breast cancer, we are collaborating with MGH on a Phase 1b/2 study of sacituzumab govitecan combining with Pfizer’s PARP inhibitor, TALZENNA®, in patients with mTNBC previously treated with no more than one prior therapeutic regimens for metastatic disease. In endometrial cancer, we are collaborating with Yale University on a Phase 2 study of sacituzumab govitecan in patients with persistent and recurrent endometrial cancer. Through an agreement with The Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium, we are collaborating with the University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center to investigate sacituzumab govitecan in a Phase 2 study to assess whether targeting Trop-2 with sacituzumab govitecan is promising in prostate cancer patients. In addition to the Phase 2 study, Dr. Lang, the lead investigator at the University of Wisconsin, is also leading a broad translational program integrated into the clinical study to further validate the expression and importance of Trop-2 as a therapeutic target in various stages of prostate cancer. 
A separate research collaboration was also established with Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center to investigate sacituzumab govitecan and IMMU-130 as a single agent and in combination in prostate cancer xenograft models.
Funding Agreement
On January 7, 2018, we entered into a funding agreement (the “Funding Agreement”) with RPI Finance Trust, a Delaware statutory trust (“RPI”). Pursuant to the Funding Agreement, we granted RPI the right to receive certain royalty amounts, subject to certain reductions, based on the net sales of the antibody-drug conjugate IMMU-132 (sacituzumab govitecan) (the “Product”), for each calendar quarter during the term of the Funding Agreement (“Revenue Participation Right”), in exchange for $175,000,000 in cash (the “Purchase Price”). Specifically, the royalty rate commences at 4.15 percent on net annual sales of up to $2 billion, declining step-wise based on sales tiers to 1.75 percent on net global annual sales exceeding $6 billion. In addition, after the seventh anniversary of the First Commercial Sale (as defined in the Funding Agreement) in the United States and following a change of control of the Company, we shall have the option to repurchase fifty percent (50%) of the Revenue Participation Right from RPI, at the net present value (calculated using a 5% discount rate) of the projected royalty payments based upon the then projected sales of the Product.
Government Regulation
Regulatory Compliance
Our research and development activities, including testing in laboratory animals and in humans, our manufacture of antibodies and oversight of suppliers and contract manufacturers involved in the production of our product candidates, as well as the design, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, handling, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion and marketing of the product candidates that we are developing, are all subject to stringent regulation, primarily by the FDA in the United States under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the "FDCA") and its implementing regulations, and the Public Health Service Act ("PHS Act") and its implementing regulations, and by comparable authorities under similar laws and regulations in other countries. If, for any reason, we do not comply with applicable requirements, such noncompliance can result in various adverse consequences, including one or more delays in approval of, or even the refusal to approve, product licenses or other applications, the suspension or termination of clinical investigations, the revocation of approvals previously granted, as well as fines, criminal prosecution, recall or seizure of products, injunctions against shipping products and total or partial suspension of production and/or refusal to allow us to enter into or termination of governmental supply contracts.
Product Approval
In the United States, our product candidates are regulated as biologic pharmaceuticals, or biologics. The FDA's regulatory authority for the approval of biologics resides in the PHS Act. However, biologics are also subject to regulation under the FDCA because most biological products also meet the FDCA's definition of "drugs." Most pharmaceuticals or "conventional drugs" consist of pure chemical substances and their structures are known. Most biologics, however, are complex mixtures that are not easily identified or characterized. Biological products differ from conventional drugs in that they tend to be heat-sensitive and susceptible to microbial contamination, thus requiring sterile manufacturing processes. The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually;


• | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is initiated;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic, and its safety and efficacy for each indication;


• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a BLA for a new biologic, after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) regulations; and


• | FDA review and approval of a BLA for a new biologic, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product in the United States.

Preclinical tests assess the potential safety and efficacy of a product candidate in animal models. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices (“cGCPs”), which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical trial site’s IRB before the trials may be initiated, and the IRB must monitor the study until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
The clinical investigation of a pharmaceutical, including a biologic, is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined.

• | Phase 1 studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.


• | Phase 2 includes controlled clinical trials conducted to preliminarily or further evaluate the effectiveness of the investigational product for a particular indication(s) in patients with the disease or condition under study, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the product.


• | Phase 3 clinical trials are generally controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded patient population generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.

The FDA may place clinical trials on hold at any point in this process if, among other reasons, it concludes that clinical subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Trials may also be terminated by IRBs, which must review and approve all research involving human subjects. Side effects or adverse events that are reported during clinical trials can delay, impede or prevent marketing authorization.
The results of the preclinical and clinical testing, along with information regarding the manufacturing of the product and proposed product labeling, are evaluated and, if determined appropriate, submitted to the FDA through a BLA. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Once the BLA submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s standard goal is to review applications within ten months of the filing date or, if the application relates to a drug that treats a serious condition and would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness qualifying for Priority Review, six months from the filing date. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.

The FDA offers certain programs, such as BTD and Fast Track designation, designed to expedite the development and review of applications for products intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. For BTD, preliminary clinical evidence of the product indicates that it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If BTD or Fast Track designation is obtained, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a BLA before the application is complete, and the product may be eligible for accelerated approval. However, receipt of BTD or Fast Track designation for a product candidate does not ensure that a product will be developed or approved on an expedited basis, and such designation may be rescinded if the product candidate is found to no longer meet the qualifying criteria.

The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, pure and potent, which includes determining whether it is effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP, to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer an application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved, and applications for new molecular entities and original BLAs are generally discussed at advisory committee meetings unless the FDA determines that this type of consultation is not needed under the circumstances. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations.

After the FDA evaluates the BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a CRL. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application is not ready for approval. A CRL may require additional inspections, and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA could approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ("REMS") to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (“BPCIA”) created an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biologic products. The abbreviated pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as “interchangeable” based on its similarity to an existing brand product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the original branded product was approved under a BLA. In March 2015, the FDA approved Novartis’s Zarxio as a biosimilar product to Amgen’s Neupogen. Since then, as of January 2019, twenty-six biosimilar drugs have received FDA approval. In 2020, the FDA and FTC announced collaborative regulatory efforts to support the adoption of biosimilars and interchangeable products and indicated that they will take measures to discourage anti-competitive behavior and promotional statements that they deem false and misleading.
Expedited Review and Approval
The FDA has four program designations/approval pathways — Fast Track, BTD, Accelerated Approval, and Priority Review — to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs and biologics to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions. The Fast Track designation provides pharmaceutical manufacturers with opportunities for frequent interactions with FDA reviewers during the product’s development and the ability for the manufacturer to do a rolling submission of the BLA. A rolling submission allows completed portions of the application to be submitted and reviewed by the FDA on an ongoing basis. The BTD provides manufacturers with all of the features of the Fast Track designation as well as intensive guidance on implementing an efficient development program for the product and a commitment by the FDA to involve senior managers and experienced review staff in the review. The Accelerated Approval designation allows the FDA to approve a product based on an effect on a surrogate or intermediate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a product’s clinical benefit and generally requires the manufacturer to conduct required post-approval confirmatory trials to verify the clinical benefit. The Priority Review designation means that the FDA’s goal is to take action on the BLA within six months, compared to ten months under standard review. The BLA submitted in 2018 for sacituzumab govitecan in patients with mTNBC was accepted by the FDA and the original application was granted Priority Review. On January 17, 2019, we received a CRL from the FDA for the sacituzumab govitecan BLA. We requested a meeting with the FDA to gain a full understanding of its requirements and the resulting timelines for preparation of the resubmission, agency review, and an agency decision on the resubmission. On November 30, 2019 we resubmitted our BLA to the FDA and on December 23, 2019 we received notification from the FDA that the BLA was accepted for filing and further assigned a new PDUFA target action date as June 2, 2020. Refer to "Overview" above for additional information.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed by us or on our behalf pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies, including requirements for record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences with the biologic, submitting biological product deviation reports to notify the FDA of unanticipated changes in distributed products, establishment registration, compliance with cGMP standards (including investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP), and certain state licensing requirements. Additionally, any significant change in the approved product or in how it is manufactured, including changes in formulation or the site of manufacture, generally require prior FDA approval, and even changes that may seem less significant must be evaluated under change control procedures to assess their potential impact on product quality and relative to the specifications on file with the FDA, and whether they trigger notification or approval requirements. The packaging and labeling of all products developed by us are also subject to FDA approval and ongoing regulation. Noncompliance with any regulatory requirements can result in, among other things, issuance of warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, seizures, and injunctive action. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
The commercial distribution of prescription drugs is subject to the Drug Supply Chain Security Act ("DSCSA"), which regulates the distribution of the products at the federal level, and sets certain standards for federal or state registration and compliance of entities in the supply chain (manufacturers and packagers, wholesale distributors, third-party logistics providers, and dispensers). The DSCSA preempts certain previously enacted state laws and the pedigree requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act ("PDMA"). Trading partners within the drug supply chain must now ensure certain product tracing requirements are met, and are required to exchange transaction information, transaction history, and transaction statements. Further, the DSCSA limits the distribution of prescription biopharmaceutical products and imposes requirements to ensure overall accountability and security in the drug supply chain. Product identifier information (an aspect of the product tracing scheme) is also now required. The DSCSA requirements, development of standards, and the system for product tracing have been and will continue to be phased in over a period of years through 2023, and subject companies will need to continue their implementation efforts. The distribution of product samples continues to be regulated under the PDMA, and some states also impose regulations on drug sample distribution.
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations, guidance documents, and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our product candidates. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
Orphan Drug Act
We have successfully obtained Orphan Drug designation by the FDA under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983 for sacituzumab govitecan for SCLC and pancreatic cancer. Under the Orphan Drug Act, FDA may grant Orphan Drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan Drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. In the United States, Orphan Drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. Orphan Drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA Orphan Drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same orphan indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer of the approved product cannot assure sufficient quantities. As a result, there can be no assurance that our competitors will not receive approval of drugs or biologics that have a different active ingredient for treatment of the diseases for which our products and product candidates are targeted.
Foreign Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates being developed, and products being marketed outside of the United States. We must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of our products in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than required by the FDA for BLA licensure. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. As in the United States, we are subject to post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacturing, marketing, or distribution.
Other Regulatory Considerations
We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, The Clean Air Act, New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and other current and potential future federal, state, or local regulations. Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biological materials and various radioactive compounds. We believe that our procedures comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations; however, the risk of injury or accidental contamination cannot be completely eliminated.
We may also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments where we may market our products and product candidates, if approved. These laws and regulations include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, data privacy and security, aggregate spend reporting, and product price advertising.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities including pharmaceutical manufacturers from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in case or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, or either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease or order or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted broadly to apply to, among other things, arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other hand. The term “remuneration” expressly includes kickbacks, bribes or rebates and also has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions; however, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor may be subject to scrutiny. The failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from federal Anti-Kickback Statute liability in all cases. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended ("ACA") codified cash law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a claims payment to, or approval by, the federal government that are false, fictitious or fraudulent, or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes "any request or demand" for money or property presented to the federal government. Although we do not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to "cause" the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, promoting a product for unapproved uses (also known as "off-label promotion"), marketing products of sub-standard quality, or, as noted above, paying a kickback that results in a claim for items or services in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute. In addition, our activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under the False Claims Act. For example, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have faced enforcement actions under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal healthcare programs for the product. The federal civil False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a "whistleblower" to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also implicate the False Claims Act. Although the False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. 
In addition to the Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, there are state statutes and regulations equivalent or substantially similar to the federal laws which may extend to items and services reimbursed by commercial insurers and/or by patients directly. State law equivalents to the Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act may not have adopted exceptions and safe harbors available at the federal level and therefore, may implicate a broader range of activities. 
To the extent we obtain coverage for our products by state Medicaid programs, we may be required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for any covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program, and to comply with all Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veterans Healthcare Act of 1992. Moreover, federal law requires that any company participating in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program also participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B Program, which impose additional reporting requirements and price concessions. Manufacturer compliance with 340B Program requirements can be costly. In addition, if our products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration or to low income patients of certain hospitals, additional laws and requirements may apply.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or obtain, by any means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.

There has also been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The federal physician payment transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the “Physician Payments Sunshine Act,” created under the ACA, and its implementing regulations, which requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to annually report to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Under recent legislation, the Sunshine Act will extend to payments and transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and other mid-level healthcare providers (with reporting requirements going into effect in 2022 for payments and transfers made in 2021). Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") has the potential to impose penalties of up to $1.15 million per year for violations of the Sunshine Act, depending on the circumstances, and payments reported under the Sunshine Act also have the potential to draw scrutiny on payments to and relationships with physicians and teaching hospitals, which may have implications under the Anti-Kickback Statute and other healthcare laws.
We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the state governments in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act of 2009 ("HITECH") and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes, among other things, obligations, including mandatory contractual terms with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, and business associates. Among other things, HITECH made certain aspects of HIPAA’s rules (notably the Security Rule) directly applicable to business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain individually identifiable health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH created four tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal court to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. The Department of Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights ("OCR") has increased its focus on compliance and continues to train state attorneys general for enforcement purposes. The OCR has recently increased both its efforts to audit HIPAA compliance and its level of enforcement, with one recent penalty exceeding $5.0 million. 
Even where HIPAA does not apply, according to the United States Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers' personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act ("FTCA"), 15 United States C § 45(a). The FTC expects a company's data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Medical data is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. The FTC's guidance for appropriately securing consumers' personal information is similar to what is required by the HIPAA Security Rule.
There are numerous other laws and legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing privacy and security concerns, and some state privacy laws apply in broader circumstances than HIPAA. California recently enacted legislation – the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), which took effect January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, created new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provided new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also created a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. The California Attorney General will issue clarifying regulations. Although the law, as initially enacted, included certain limited exceptions, including for information collected as part of clinical trials as specified in the law, it remains unclear what language the final Attorney General regulations will contain or how the statue and regulations will be interpreted.    
We are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), which prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. Under this act, it is illegal to pay, offer to pay, or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. 
Marketing, Sales and Distribution
As noted above, we intend to bring sacituzumab govitecan to the United States market on our own for patients with mTNBC. In anticipation of bringing sacituzumab govitecan to market, we have built a commercial operation with a total sales force of approximately 56 colleagues. We also have maintained a core commercial infrastructure preparing for launch readiness. 
In April 2019, we entered into the Promotion Agreement with Janssen pursuant to which we will provide non-exclusive product detailing services to Janssen. Pursuant to the Promotion Agreement, we will provide a dedicated sales team to market Janssen's Balversa (erdafitinib) to oncologists and other targeted health care providers in the United States. Under the terms of the Promotion Agreement, Janssen maintains ownership of the New Drug Application for the product as well as legal, regulatory, distribution, commercialization and manufacturing responsibilities for the product, while we will provide product detailing services to Janssen. Refer to "Note 2 - Revenue Recognition" for additional information.
Manufacturing
We operate a cGMP manufacturing facility in Morris Plains, New Jersey for the production of ADC product candidates for clinical trials, as well as, potentially, for commercial use.
Presently, we believe our Morris Plains facility has enough capacity to produce sufficient quantities of hRS7, the anti-Trop-2 antibody used in sacituzumab govitecan, to support the initial commercial launch of sacituzumab govitecan in the United States, pending FDA approval. To meet our projected future demand of sacituzumab govitecan, we have contracted with Samsung Biologics Co., Ltd. for commercial-scale antibody production. Our global supply chain also includes two outside contract manufacturing organizations: Johnson Matthey Pharma Services of Devens, Massachusetts for the manufacture of the linker-drug payload, and BSP Pharmaceuticals of Latina Scalo, Italy for the conjugation of the antibody with the linker-drug and fill/finish of the sacituzumab govitecan drug product. Together, our end-to-end supply chain has capacity to support the potential commercial launch of sacituzumab govitecan in the United States, as well as the multitude of clinical development programs globally. 
Manufacturing Regulatory Considerations
In addition to regulating and auditing human clinical trials, the FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities and processes used in the manufacturing of such products prior to providing approval to market a product. If, after receiving approval from the FDA, a material change is made in manufacturing equipment, location, or process related to an approved product, additional regulatory review may be required. We must also adhere to cGMP and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. The FDA also conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities, and processes following the initial approval. If, as a result of these inspections, the FDA determines that our equipment, facilities or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product approval, the FDA may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against us, including the suspension of our manufacturing operations.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we employed 366 persons on a full-time basis, 71 of whom were engaged in research, clinical research and regulatory affairs, 182 of whom were engaged in operations and manufacturing and quality control, and 113 of whom were engaged in finance, administration, sales and marketing. We believe that while we have been successful to date in attracting skilled and experienced scientific personnel, competition for such personnel continues to be intense and there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to attract and retain the professionals we will need to grow our business. Our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we believe that our relationship with our employees is excellent.
