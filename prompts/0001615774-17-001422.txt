Item 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are a Portland, Oregon-based producer and marketer of craft spirits, founded in 2008. Our products span several alcoholic beverage categories, including bourbon, American whiskey, vodka and rum. As a small business in the large, international spirits marketplace dominated by massive conglomerates, we rely heavily on our creativity. Our mission is to be an innovator in creating spirits that offer better value than comparable spirits, for example our Burnside Bourbon and Portland Potato Vodka, and in creating imaginative spirits that offer an unusual taste experience, for example our cold-brewed coffee rum, Oregon oak aged whiskeys, Marionberry Whiskey and Peppermint Bark holiday liquor. Our strategy is to expand from our local base in the Pacific Northwest by using major spirits distributors, such as Southern Glazer Wines and Spirits, to address the demand for premium and high-end craft spirits. In late 2016, to aid us in this strategy, we retained Sandstrom Partners, a Portland-based firm specializing in spirits branding, and tasked them with reviewing our current product portfolio, as well as our new ideas, and advising us on marketing, creation of brand awareness and product positioning, locally and nationally. We also intend to capitalize on our uniqueness as a publicly-traded craft spirit producer, with access to the public markets, to support our growth, including by making strategic acquisitions.
Market Opportunity
 
Large and Growing Global and Domestic Markets
 
The global spirits market had total revenues of $316 billion in 2013, representing a compound average growth rate (CAGR) of 3.4% between 2009 and 2013, according to MarketLine. The performance of the market is forecasted to accelerate with an anticipated CAGR of 4.2% for the five-year period 2013-2018, which is expected to drive the market to a value of approximately $388 billion by the end of 2018.
 
The U.S. spirits market had total revenues of $24.1 billion in 2015, representing a 25% increase since 2010, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS). The domestic market share of spirits compared to beer and wine was at a record 35.4% in 2015 according to DISCUS, representing more than a 2% gain over beer and wine in terms of market share since 2010.
 
Key Growth Trends that We Target
 
Craft – The market share of “craft” distillers (defined as any producer that bottles less than 100,000 cases annually), such as us, is projected to reach 8% by 2020, according to BNP Paribas.
Women – Women increasingly prefer spirits over beer and wine, and flavored spirits in particular. TTB, Park Street and the US Census Bureau estimate that 37% of all U.S. whiskey drinkers are women.
 
Millennials – As a generalization, Millennials (individuals born between the early 1980s and the mid-1990s) value “authenticity” and are inspired by travel to try new products and experiences, per BeverageDaily.com. Millennials also drink a broader range of spirit types (vodka, rum, tequila, whiskey, gin) than prior generations. Millennials, including women, often are attracted to vintage spirits and cocktails that have nostalgic followings, such as whiskey and cocktails that are emblematic of the 1950’s like rye, bourbon, and the Manhattan cocktail. Along with an increase in disposable income, they are willing to purchase premium spirits.
 
Flavored – Flavored spirits sales are outpacing the rest of the spirits industry, growing ten times faster than the overall market, and flavored whiskey, that is especially appealing to younger drinkers and women, is the fastest growing flavored spirit category.
International – The demand for U.S.-produced spirits abroad is increasing significantly. U.S. spirit exports nearly doubled over the past decade to $1.56 billion in 2015, and whiskey exports were up approximately 5.4% in 2015 over 2014. The largest export markets for U.S. spirits include the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Australia and Japan.
Our Strategy
 
Our objective is to build Eastside Distilling into a profitable spirits company, with a distinctive portfolio of premium and high-end spirits brands that have national, and even international, consumer appeal and following. To help achieve this, we expect to:
 
·          Target Industry Growth Trends. Demand for U.S.-produced premium and high-end craft spirits, particularly whiskeys, has been increasing amongst millennials and women. We capitalize on these trends by developing products that appeal to changing demographics, as typified by our Master Distiller, Melissa Heim, whom we believe is the first female distiller and blender west of the Mississippi River.
 
·          Be Experimental. We are not afraid to take chances with product offerings that the larger and more bureaucratic companies that dominate the industry would hesitate to launch.
 
·          Be Local. Be true to our Oregon and Northwest “roots” by shunning artificial additives, using locally sourced ingredients such as our high-quality water and Oregon oak, and relying on skilled local artisans.
 
·          Provide Value. We target the high-growth premium ($12-20 per bottle) and high-end ($20-30 per bottle) market segments with premium quality at attractive pricing. Even in the super premium category, above $50 per bottle, we intend to have limited production offerings that have exceptional value.
 
·          Use Sales Networks of Major U.S. Spirits Distributors. We have established and will continue to build relationships with the major wine and spirit wholesalers to distribute our products into the largest spirits markets in the United States.
 
·          Expand Geographically. We are building brand awareness and driving sales in multiple geographic markets, with the use of social media (Twitter, Facebook, YouTube) and traditional media (TV, radio and digital) marketing strategy.
 
·          List Products in Control States and Top Consumption States. In addition to the top consumption states (California, Florida, Illinois, New York and Texas) we will continue our efforts in the 18 liquor control states where distilled spirits are sold through state-owned and operated stores known as ABC (alcohol beverage control) stores, since doing business with these states simplifies the sales process and increases the likelihood of timely payment.
 
·          Increase Production. We expect our annual production of cases to increase each year. We believe our increased production capacity will make us more attractive to distribution partners and will also generate additional revenues and profits.
 
·          Commit to Quality and Innovation. We will maintain our ability to consistently produce and deliver quality products across a family of brands, including upgrading our packaging for our legacy products.
 
·          Leverage Public Company Advantage. The public capital markets provide us access to capital and supports our long-term growth initiatives, including potential strategic acquisitions.
 
Our Strengths
 
We believe the following competitive strengths will enable the implementation of our growth strategies:
 
·          Award Winning Diverse Product Line. We have a diverse product line offering of more than fourteen (14) premium craft spirits, many of which have won awards for taste and/or product design. In addition, premium craft spirits have experienced a compound annual growth rate of 7.6% over the last decade, which is higher than the 5.5% compound annual growth rate for mass produced spirits. Our sales of premium brands have increased over 1,000% since 2011. We believe our diverse, recognized product line in this growing market will enable us to establish a presence in new geographic markets and enable us to procure additional distributors for our products.
 
·          Key Relationships. We have signed distribution agreements with several of the largest wine and spirits distributors in the United States, such as Southern Glazer. We have also engaged Park Street Imports, a provider of back-office administrative and logistical services for alcohol and beverage distributors. We believe these relationships will facilitate our goal of having our premium spirits sold and distributed nationwide.
 
·          Experienced Master Distiller. Our master distiller, Melissa “Mel” Heim, whom we believe is the first female distiller and blender west of the Mississippi River, is an important factor in distinguishing our brands. We believe that Ms. Heim’s highly regarded “palate” is important to us in maintaining a high quality artisanal character to our products as well as adding to our consumer appeal.
 



Our Product Approach
 
Our approach to our craft spirits involves five important aspects:
 
·          Commitment to Quality. We create and deliver high-quality, innovative products targeted at growing markets;
 
·          Authentic Yet Scalable. We believe our approach to production allows us to produce our products at scale while keeping flavor profiles consistent;
 
·          Unique Talent & Experience. Every spirit reflects the creativity of our entire team;
 
·          14 Spirit Portfolio. Many craft distillers have only one to three products; we have 14 which we believe affords us the opportunity to target a broader range of consumers with our brands; and
 
·          Generate Customer Loyalty. These factors attract loyal and enthusiastic customers and major distributors for our products.
 
Our Brands
 
We manufacture, develop, produce and market the premium brands listed below:
 
Burnside Bourbon. We develop, market and produce two premium, barrel–aged bourbons: Burnside Bourbon and Oregon Oak Burnside Bourbon. Our Burnside Bourbon is aged in oak barrels, is 96 proof and won a Gold Medal in the MicroLiquor Spirit Awards in 2014, and another from Beverage Tasting Institute. Our Oregon Oak Burnside Bourbon is produced in limited quantities and aged for an additional 90 days in Oregon heavily charred oak barrels and we consider it an “ultra-premium” brand. Our Burnside Bourbon brands accounted for approximately 40%, 35% and 40% of our revenues for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Barrel Hitch American Whiskey. We develop, market and produce two premium whiskeys: Barrel Hitch American Whiskey and Barrel Hitch Oregon Oaked Whiskey. Our whiskey is 80 proof and won a triple-Gold Medal and best of show in the MicroLiquor Spirit Awards in 2015. Our Oregon Oak version is produced in limited quantities and aged for an additional 90 days in Oregon heavily charred oak barrels and we consider it an “ultra-premium” brand. Our Whiskey brand was introduced in July of 2015 and accounted for approximately 17% and 7% of our revenues for fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Premium Vodka. We develop, market and produce a premium potato vodka under the brand name Portland Potato Vodka which is distilled from potatoes rather than grain and as such is gluten free. Eastside Portland Potato Vodka was awarded a silver medal from the American Wine Society as well as a gold medal from the Beverage Tasting Institute which also gave it a “Best Buy” rating. Our Portland Premium Vodka accounted for approximately 13%, 14% and 30% of our revenues for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Distinctive Specialty Whiskeys. We develop, market and produce two distinctive whiskeys: Cherry Bomb Whiskey and Marionberry Whiskey. Our Cherry Bomb Whiskey combines handcrafted small batch whiskey with a blast of real Oregon cherries. Our Cherry Bomb Whiskey won a gold medal from the American Wine Society and was also awarded a gold medal for taste and a silver medal for package design in the MircroLiquor Spirit Awards. Our Marionberry whiskey combines Oregon marionberries (a hybrid blackberry) with premium aged whiskey and was awarded two silver medals in the MicroLiquor Spirit Awards for taste and package design. Our distinctive whiskeys accounted for approximately 12%, 15% and 10% of our revenues for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Below Deck Rums. We develop, market and produce 4 rums under the Below Deck brand name: Below Deck Silver Rum, Below Deck Spiced Rum, Below Deck Coffee Rum and Below Deck Ginger Rum. Below Deck’s Silver Rum is Eastside’s original rum. Below Deck Spiced Rum is double-distilled from molasses and infused with exotic spices and won a triple gold medal for taste and a bronze medal for package design in the MicroLiquor Spirit Awards. Our Below Deck Coffee Rum is double-distilled and infused with coffee flavors from Arabica bean and won a silver medal at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition.

In addition to our premium bourbons, whiskeys, rum and vodka, we create seasonal and limited-edition handmade products such as Advocaat (eggnog) Liqueur, Peppermint Bark Liqueur, Bier Schnapps and Holiday Spiced Liqueur. Our Seasonal/Limited Edition Spirits accounted for approximately 6%, 10% and 10% of our revenues for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Other Merchandise and Events. We conduct and host events as well as sell other merchandise at our various retail locations (such as mixers, glasses, etc). Our other merchandise and event activities accounted for approximately 2%, 7% and 0% of our revenues for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
MotherLode Craft Distillery
 
On March 8, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of MotherLode Craft Distillery (“MotherLode”), a Portland, Oregon based provider of bottling services and production support to craft distilleries. Since its founding in 2014 by Allen Barteld, the mission of MotherLode has been to enable craft distillers to increase their production and extend their product lines, reducing cost and increasing efficiency, thereby freeing them to focus on their craft. The typical MotherLode customer is a distillery of small batch, hand-crafted spirits, or a premium craft spirit sold as a private label. We plan to relocate much of our own operations to MotherLode’s facility and jointly expand both companies manufacturing resources. Plans are in place for a pneumatic bottling line, allowing for a five times increase in bottling rate, and large volume spirit handling capability. The Company believes the MotherLode operations will be immediately accretive to earnings. The Company further believes that cost reductions associated with the acquisition and relocation will exceed $200,000 per annum. In addition to bottling services for distillers and other producers of spirits, MotherLode bottles "private label" craft spirits for customers who have on-premise or off-premise licenses including retail and liquor stores, bars, restaurants, events, and businesses who want to take advantage of the benefits that come from having their brand clearly printed on a label. MotherLode’s premium craft spirits can also be private labeled for corporate gifts, wedding, birthdays and other personal events. We believe that MotherLode can help with new product development and the implementation of Eastside's spirits branding initiatives in concert with our Portland-based spirits branding firm, Sandstorm Partners. We issued 260,000 shares of common stock to the owners of MotherLode as consideration for the acquisition. Based on the closing share price of our common stock of $1.45 on March 8, 2017, the value of the transaction was $377,000 which is approximately equal to the revenues of MotherLode in 2016. Additionally, Eastside entered into a three-year employment agreement with Allen Barteld and issued standard employee stock options, with vesting over five years. The terms of the acquisition and Mr. Barteld’s employment are more fully set forth in the Form 8-K filed on March 14, 2017.
Production and Supply
 
There are several steps in the production and supply process for beverage alcohol products. First, all of our spirits products are distilled. This is a multi-stage process that converts basic ingredients, such as grain, sugar cane or agave, into alcohol. Next, the alcohol is processed and/or aged in various ways depending on the requirements of the specific brand. For our vodka, this processing is designed to remove all other chemicals, so that the resulting liquid will be odorless and colorless, and have a smooth quality with minimal harshness. Achieving a high level of purity involves a series of distillations and filtration processes. For our large production products, we currently source full strength and barrel strength (reduced ABV due to evaporation) that we further process (such as aging in Oregon Oak, or adding ingredients) and bottle at our premises.
 
For our spirits brands, rather than removing flavor, various complex flavor profiles are achieved through one or more of the following techniques: infusion of fruit, addition of various flavoring substances, and, in the case of rums and whiskeys, aging of the brands in various types of casks for extended periods of time, and the blending of several rums or whiskeys to achieve a unique flavor profile for each brand. After the distillation, purification and flavoring processes are completed, the various liquids are bottled. This involves several important stages, including bottle and label design and procurement, filling of the bottles and packaging the bottles in various configurations for shipment.
 
We rely on a limited number of suppliers for the sourcing of our spirit products and raw materials. We believe that we have consistent and reliable third party sources for spirit product. However, we produce and bottle our spirits for distribution, whether the distilling stage of the process was at our facility or not.
 
Distribution Network
 
We believe that the distribution network that we have developed with our sales team and our independent distributors and brokers is one of our key strengths. We currently have distribution and brokerage relationships with third-party distributors in 22 U.S. states.
 
U.S. Distribution
 
Importers of beverage alcohol in the U.S. must sell their products through a three-tier distribution system. Typically, an imported brand is first sold to a U.S. importer, who then sells it to a network of distributors, or wholesalers, covering the U.S., in either “open” states or “control” states. In the 33 open states, the distributors are generally large, privately-held companies. In the 18 control states, the states themselves function as the distributor, and regulate suppliers such as us. The distributors and wholesalers in turn sell to individual retailers, such as liquor stores, restaurants, bars, supermarkets and other outlets licensed to sell beverage alcohol. In larger states, such as New York, more than one distributor may handle a brand in separate geographical areas. In control states, importers sell their products directly to state liquor authorities, which distribute the products and either operate retail outlets or license the retail sales function to private companies, while maintaining strict control over pricing and profit.
 
The U.S. spirits industry has consolidated dramatically over the last ten years due to merger and acquisition activity. There are currently eight major spirits companies, each of which own and operate their own importing businesses. All companies, including these large companies, are required by law to sell their products through wholesale distributors in the U.S. The major companies are exerting increasing influence over the regional distributors and as a result, it has become more difficult for smaller companies to get their products recognized by the distributors.
 
Importation
 
We hold the federal importer and wholesaler license required by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the U.S. Treasury Department, and the requisite state licenses within the states we conduct business.
 
Our inventory is maintained in our warehouse and shipped nationally by our network of licensed and bonded carriers.
 
Wholesalers and Distributors
 
In the U.S., we are required by law to use state-licensed distributors or, in the control states, state-owned agencies performing this function, to sell our brands to retail outlets. As a result, we depend on distributors for sales, for product placement and for retail store penetration. We have no distribution agreements or minimum sales requirements with any of our U.S. alcohol distributors, and they are under no obligation to place our products or market our brands. All of the distributors also distribute our competitors’ products and brands. As a result, we must foster and maintain our relationships with our distributors. Through our internal sales team, we have established relationships for our brands with wholesale distributors in the twenty-two states we sell our products, and our products are sold in the U.S. by seven wholesale distributors, as well as by various state beverage alcohol control agencies.
Other Sources of Revenue
 
Retail Stores and Kiosks
 
We operate retail stores in the Portland, Oregon area that allow us to offer consumers a chance to taste and purchase our various products, which provides us with additional revenue. Three of our four locations that we currently operate are located in high foot-traffic shopping malls. During the holiday season, we also attempt to open additional, temporary locations. We intend to maintain these retail stores and kiosks to build local brand awareness and direct-to-consumer retail sales. Some of these stores will contain in-store tastings, which we believe will lead to additional product purchases.
In-House Tasting Room and Special Events
 
We also generate revenue from attending and/or hosting special events, which similar to our retails stores enables us to offer consumers an opportunity to taste and then purchase our various products. In addition to the revenue and brand building these tastings generate, we value the immediate customer feedback during these events, which is instrumental to creating better products and testing new flavors.
Significant Customers
 
Sales to one distributor, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission, accounted for approximately 32% and 32% of our consolidated sales for years 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
Sales Team
 
We have a total sales force of ten people, with an average of over ten years of industry experience with premium beverage alcohol brands.
 
Our sales personnel are engaged in the day-to-day management of our distributors, which includes setting quotas, coordinating promotional plans for our brands, maintaining adequate levels of stock, brand education and training and sales calls with distributor personnel. Our sales team also maintains relationships with key retail customers through independent sales calls. They also schedule promotional events, create local brand promotion plans, host in-store tastings, where permitted, and provide wait staff and bartender training and education for our brands.
 
In addition, we have also engaged Park Street Imports, a provider of back-office administrative and logistical services for alcohol and beverage distributors, which services include state compliance, logistics planning, order processing, distributor chargeback and bill-support management and certain accounting and reporting services.
 
Advertising, Marketing and Promotion
 
To build our brands, we must effectively communicate with three distinct audiences: our distributors, the retail trade and the end consumer. Advertising, marketing and promotional activities help to establish and reinforce the image of our brands in our efforts to build substantial brand value.
 
In late 2016, to aid us in this strategy, we retained Sandstrom Partners, a Portland-based firm specializing in spirits branding, and tasked them with reviewing our current product portfolio, as well as our new ideas, and advising us on marketing, creation of brand awareness and product positioning, locally and nationally. We intend to use Sandstrom’s full range of brand development services, including research, strategy, brand identity, package design, environments, advertising as well as digital design and development.
 
We employ three in-house marketing, sales and customer service personnel who work together with third party design and advertising firms to maintain a high degree of focus on each of our product categories and build brand awareness through innovative marketing activities. We use a range of marketing strategies and tactics to build brand equity and increase sales, including consumer and trade advertising, price promotions, point-of-sale materials, event sponsorship, in-store and on-premise promotions and public relations, as well as a variety of other traditional and non-traditional marketing techniques, including social media marketing, to support our brands.
 
Besides traditional advertising, we also employ three other marketing methods to support our brands: public relations, event sponsorships and tastings. Our significant U.S. public relations efforts have helped gain editorial coverage for our brands, which increases brand awareness. Event sponsorship is an economical way for us to have influential consumers taste our brands. We actively contribute product to trend-setting events where our brand has exclusivity in the brand category. We also conduct hundreds of in-store and on-premise promotions each year.
 
We support our brand marketing efforts with an assortment of point-of-sale materials. The combination of trade and consumer programs, supported by attractive point-of-sale materials, also establishes greater credibility for us with our distributors and retailers.
 



Intellectual Property
 
Trademarks are an important aspect of our business. We sell our products under a number of trademarks, which we own or use under license. Our brands are protected by trademark registrations or are the subject of pending applications for trademark registration in the U.S where we distribute, or plan to distribute, our brands. The trademarks may be registered in the names of our subsidiary. In the U.S., trademark registrations need to be renewed every ten years. We expect to register our trademarks in additional markets as we expand our distribution territories.
Seasonality
 
Our industry is subject to seasonality with peak retail sales generally occurring in the fourth calendar quarter, primarily due to seasonal holiday buying. Historically, this holiday demand has resulted in higher sales for us in our fourth quarter.
Competition
 
The beverage alcohol industry is highly competitive. We believe that we compete on the basis of quality, price, brand recognition and distribution strength. Our premium brands compete with other alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages for consumer purchases, retail shelf space, restaurant presence and wholesaler attention. We compete with numerous multinational producers and distributors of beverage alcohol products, many of which have greater resources than us.
 
Over the past ten years, the U.S. wine and spirits industry has undergone dramatic consolidation and realignment of brands and brand ownership. The number of major importers in the U.S. has declined significantly. Today there are eight major companies: Diageo PLC, Pernod Ricard S.A., Bacardi Limited, Brown-Forman Corporation, Beam Suntory Inc., Davide Campari Milano-S.p.A., and Remy Cointreau S.A.
 
We believe that we are sometimes in a better position to partner with small to mid-size brands than the major importers. Despite our relative capital position and resources, we have been able to compete with these larger companies in pursuing agency distribution agreements and acquiring brands by being more responsive to private and family-owned brands, offering flexible transaction structures and providing brand owners the option to retain local production and “home” market sales. Given our size relative to our major competitors, most of which have multi-billion dollar operations, we believe that we can provide greater focus on smaller brands and tailor transaction structures based on individual brand owner preferences. However, our relative capital position and resources may limit our marketing capabilities, limit our ability to expand into new markets and limit our negotiating ability with our distributors.
 
By focusing on the premium and super-premium segments of the market, which typically have higher margins, and having an established, experienced sales force, we believe we are able to gain relatively significant attention from our distributors for a company of our size. Also, the continued consolidation among the major companies is expected to create an opportunity for small to mid-size wine and spirits companies, such as ourselves, as the major companies contract their portfolios to focus on fewer brands.
 
Government regulation
 
We are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act, U.S. Customs Laws, Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the Alcoholic Beverage Control Laws of all fifty states.
 
The U.S. Treasury Department’s Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau regulates the production, blending, bottling, sales and advertising and transportation of alcohol products. Also, each state regulates the advertising, promotion, transportation, sale and distribution of alcohol products within its jurisdiction. We are also required to conduct business in the U.S. only with holders of licenses to import, warehouse, transport, distribute and sell spirits.
 
We are subject to U.S. regulations on the advertising, marketing and sale of beverage alcohol. These regulations range from a complete prohibition of the marketing of alcohol in some states to restrictions on the advertising style, media and messages used.
 
Labeling of spirits is also regulated in many markets, varying from health warning labels to importer identification, alcohol strength and other consumer information. All beverage alcohol products sold in the U.S. must include warning statements related to risks of drinking beverage alcohol products.
 
In the U.S. control states, the state liquor commissions act in place of distributors and decide which products are to be purchased and offered for sale in their respective states. Products are selected for purchase and sale through listing procedures which are generally made available to new products only at periodically scheduled listing interviews. Consumers may purchase products not selected for listings only through special orders, if at all.
 
The distribution of alcohol-based beverages is also subject to extensive federal and state taxation in the U.S. and internationally. Most foreign countries impose excise duties on wines and distilled spirits, although the form of such taxation varies from a simple application on units of alcohol by volume to intricate systems based on the imported or wholesale value of the product. Several countries impose additional import duty on distilled spirits, often discriminating between categories in the rate of such tariffs. Once we begin distributing our products internationally, import and excise duties could have a significant effect on our sales, both through reducing the consumption of alcohol and through encouraging consumer switching into lower-taxed categories of alcohol.
 



We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable federal, state and other regulations. However, we operate in a highly regulated industry which may be subject to more stringent interpretations of existing regulations. Future compliance costs due to regulatory changes could be significant.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 20 full-time employees, 10 of whom were in sales and marketing and three of whom were in management and seven in administration and production.
Geographic Information
 
Eastside operates in one business – premium beverage alcohol. Eastside’s product categories are rum, whiskey, vodka and specialty liquors, with an intent to sell gin and private label tequila in the future. Eastside currently sells its products in 22 states (Oregon, California, Washington, Florida, Nevada, Texas, Virginia, Indiana, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Minnesota, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Maine, Idaho, Vermont and Maryland) as well as Ontario, Canada.
Facilities
 
Our corporate headquarters are currently located in Portland, Oregon, where we lease and occupy 41,000 square feet of office and industrial space pursuant to a lease that commenced on November 1, 2014. On February 7, 2017, we announced that we had entered into a revised agreement whereby our headquarters lease will terminate June 30, 2017. On February 17, 2017, the Company entered into a Commercial Sublease Agreement which provides for suitable production space. The Company anticipates relocating to new corporate offices that will be sufficient to maintain its current operations.
Legal Proceedings
 
We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, however we could be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can, among other things, be time consuming and expensive to resolve, and divert management resources.
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated in Nevada in February 2004 under the name Eurocan Holdings, Ltd. Until the closing of the Eastside Distilling, LLC acquisition (described below), Eurocan operated solely as an online marketing and media solutions firm specializing in digital interactive media, which business was conducted through Eurocan’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Michael Williams Web Design Inc. of New York, New York (“MWW”).
The Acquisition of Eastside Distilling, LLC
 
In October 2014, Eurocan Holdings Ltd. consummated the acquisition (the “Acquisition”) of Eastside Distilling, LLC (“Eastside”) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among the Eurocan, Eastside and Eastside Distilling, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Eastside merged with and into Eastside Distilling, Inc. The merger consideration for the Acquisition consisted of 1,600,000 shares (the “Shares”) of our common stock. In addition, certain of our stockholders cancelled an aggregate of 1,245,500 shares of our common stock held by them. As a result, upon consummation of the Merger Agreement on October 31, 2014, we had 2,000,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding, of which 1,600,000 shares were held by the former members of Eastside.
 
Following the Acquisition, we conduct the business of Eastside as our primary business.
 
Spin-Off of MWW
 
Following consummation of the Acquisition, our new management conducted an evaluation of the MWW business and an analysis of the business going forward. Management determined that due to MWW’s operating and net losses in each of the last two fiscal years preceding the Acquisition, its working capital deficit as of the end of the latest fiscal year and as of the latest fiscal quarter preceding the Acquisition, and its accumulated deficit, it was not in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to continue the operation of MWW going forward. Accordingly, in February 2015, we transferred all of the outstanding shares of MWW held by us, along with all assets and liabilities related to MWW, to Michael Williams in consideration of MWW’s and Mr. Williams’ full release of all claims and liabilities related to MWW and the MWW business. Mr. Williams was the sole officer, director and employee of MWW at the time of the transaction. The spinoff of MWW resulted in the impairment of goodwill related to the Acquisition of approximately $3.2 million in December 2014. Additionally, as a result of the spin-off, we recorded a net gain of approximately $52,890 on February 3, 2015. This gain is primarily the result of the transfer of net liabilities to Mr. Williams, which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements for the year ending on December 31, 2015.
