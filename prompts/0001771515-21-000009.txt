ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OUR COMPANY
We are a high-growth, extreme value retailer of quality, name-brand consumables and fresh products sold through a network of independently operated stores. Each of our stores offers a fun, treasure hunt shopping experience in an easy-to-navigate, small-box format. An ever-changing assortment of “WOW!” deals, complemented by everyday staple products, generates customer excitement and encourages frequent visits from bargain-minded shoppers. Our flexible buying model allows us to offer quality, name-brand opportunistic products at prices generally 40% to 70% below those of conventional retailers. Entrepreneurial independent operators (“IOs”) run our stores and create a neighborhood feel through personalized customer service and a localized product offering. This differentiated approach has driven 17 consecutive years of positive comparable store sales growth.
Our founder, Jim Read, pioneered our opportunistic buying model in 1946 and subsequently developed the IO selling approach, which harnesses individual entrepreneurship and local decision-making to better serve our customers. Underlying this differentiated model was a mission that still guides us today: “Touching Lives for the Better.” Since 2006, the third generation of Read family leadership, Eric Lindberg, Jr., Chief Executive Officer, and MacGregor Read, Vice Chairman of the board of directors, has advanced this mission and accelerated growth by strengthening our supplier relationships, introducing new product categories and expanding the store base from 128 to 380 stores across the West Coast and Pennsylvania. Our passionate management team remains a driving force behind our growth-oriented culture.
Our differentiated model for buying and selling delivers a “WOW!” shopping experience, which generates customer excitement, inspires loyalty and supports profitable sales growth:
•How we buy: We source quality, name-brand consumables and fresh products opportunistically through a large, centralized purchasing team that leverages long-standing and actively managed supplier relationships to acquire merchandise at significant discounts. Our speed and efficiency in responding to supplier needs, combined with our specialized supply chain capabilities and flexible merchandising strategy, enhance our access to discounted products and allow us to turn inventory quickly and profitably. Our buyers proactively source on-trend products based on changing consumer preferences, including a wide selection of Natural, Organic, Specialty and Healthy (“NOSH”) products. We also source everyday staple products to complement our opportunistic offerings. Each store offers a curated and ever-changing assortment of approximately 5,000 SKUs, creating a “buy now” sense of urgency that promotes return visits and fosters customer loyalty.
•How we sell: Our stores are independently operated by entrepreneurial small business owners who have a relentless focus on selecting the best products for their communities, providing personalized customer service and driving improved store performance. Unlike a store manager of a traditional retailer, IOs are independent businesses and are responsible for store operations, including ordering, merchandising and managing inventory, marketing locally and directly hiring, training and employing their store workers. IOs initially contribute capital to establish their business and share store-level gross profits with us. These factors both align our interests and incentivize IOs to aggressively grow their business to realize substantial financial upside. This combination of local decision-making supported by our purchasing scale and corporate resources results in a “small business at scale” model that we believe is difficult for competitors to replicate.
Our value proposition has broad appeal with bargain-minded customers across all income levels, demographics and geographies. We believe that our sustained focus on delivering ever-changing “WOW!” deals within a fun, treasure hunt shopping environment has generated strong customer loyalty and brand affinity. We believe that our broad customer appeal supports significant new store growth opportunities, and we plan to continue to expand our reach to additional customers and geographies across the United States.
Our stores have performed well across all economic cycles, as demonstrated by our history of consistent positive comparable store sales growth and gross margin. The performance of our business during the COVID-19 pandemic further illustrates the flexibility of our model as we were able to meet the heightened demand with an assortment of products that met customer preferences. Our model is also insulated from store labor-related variability because IOs directly employ their store workers. The result is a highly scalable business with lower corporate fixed costs, providing further protection in the event of an economic downturn.
OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS 
We believe that the following competitive strengths are key drivers of our current success and position us for continued growth:
•Powerful Customer Value Proposition Supported by a “WOW!” Experience. Delivering thrilling “WOW!” deals to our customers is a cornerstone of our business. We offer customers quality, name-brand consumables and fresh products at deep discounts in a fun, treasure hunt shopping environment. Our product offering is ever-changing with a constant rotation of opportunistic products, complemented by an assortment of competitively priced everyday staples across grocery, produce, refrigerated and frozen foods, beer and wine, fresh meat and seafood, general merchandise and health and beauty care. A typical Grocery Outlet basket is priced approximately 40% lower than conventional grocers and approximately 20% lower than the leading discounters. Our stores are convenient, easy to navigate and require neither membership fees nor bulk purchases for customers to save money. Our stores have wide aisles, clear signage and a high level of customer service. Upon checkout, a cashier “circles the savings” on each customer’s receipt, which reinforces the compelling value that we provide.
•Flexible Sourcing and Distribution Model That Is Difficult to Replicate. Our flexible sourcing and distribution model differentiates us from traditional retailers and allows us to provide customers quality, name-brand products at exceptional values. As strong stewards of our suppliers’ brands, we are a preferred partner with a reputation for making rapid decisions, purchasing significant volumes and creatively solving suppliers’ inventory challenges to arrive at “win-win” outcomes. We take advantage of opportunities to acquire merchandise at substantial discounts that regularly arise from order cancellations, manufacturer overruns, packaging changes and approaching “sell-by” dates. We supplement our “WOW!” deals with everyday staples in order to provide a convenient shopping experience. Our buying strategy is deliberately flexible, which allows us to react to constantly changing opportunities. Our centralized sourcing team has deep experience and decades-long relationships with leading consumer packaged goods (“CPG”) companies. Our team is highly selective when evaluating the growing number of opportunities available to us and maintains a disciplined yet solutions-oriented approach. Our specialized model is supported by a supply chain designed to quickly and efficiently deliver an ever-changing assortment of products to store shelves.
•Independent Operators Who Are the Foundation of Our “Small Business at Scale” Model. Our stores are independent business entities operated by entrepreneurial small business owners who have a relentless focus on ordering and merchandising the best products for their communities, providing personalized customer service and driving improved store performance. We generally share 50% of store-level gross profits with IOs, thereby incentivizing them to aggressively grow their business and realize substantial financial upside. IOs leverage our extensive purchasing scale, sophisticated ordering and information systems and field support in order to operate more efficiently. This combination of local decision-making supported by our purchasing expertise and corporate resources results in a “small business at scale” model that we believe is difficult for competitors to replicate. The vast majority of the IOs operate a single store, with most working as two-person teams. We encourage the IOs to establish local roots and actively participate in their communities to foster strong personal connections with customers. The IOs select the majority of their merchandise based on local preferences, providing a unique assortment tailored to their community. Our collaborative relationship with the IOs creates a powerful selling model allowing us to deliver customers exceptional value with a local touch.
•Proven and Consistent New Store Economics. Our new stores have generated robust store-level financial results, strong cash flow and attractive returns. Our highly flexible, small-box format of 15,000 to 20,000 total square feet has been successful across geographic regions, population densities and demographic groups, and has proved resilient to competitive entries from discounters and conventional retailers alike. On average, our stores achieve profitability during the first year of operations, reach maturity in four to five years and realize a payback on investment within four years. We believe that our broad customer appeal, differentiated value proposition and the predictable financial performance of our stores across vintages provide a high degree of visibility into the embedded earnings growth from our recently opened stores.
•Value-Oriented Brand Aligned with Favorable Consumer Trends. We believe that consumers’ search for value is the new normal in retail. The success of off-price retailers represents a secular consumer shift toward value as a leading factor in purchasing decisions. Moreover, as Millennials mature and Baby Boomers age, we believe that they are increasingly focused on value, driving shopper traffic towards the deep discount channel. We have spent decades building our IO and opportunistic purchasing models to offer deep discounts in a customer-friendly store environment, which enables us to take advantage of this ongoing preference for value.
•Collaborative Company Culture Provides the Foundation for Continued Success. One of our key competitive advantages is our culture of family and community values, grounded in integrity, entrepreneurship, performance and collaboration. We have been dedicated to our mission of “Touching Lives for the Better” since our inception. Our passion and commitment are shared by team members throughout the entire organization, from the IOs and their employees to our distribution centers and corporate offices. We are a third-generation, family-run business led by CEO Eric Lindberg. Mr. Lindberg has been with Grocery Outlet for over 20 years and has instilled a “servant leadership” mentality that empowers employees and IOs and forms the basis of our highly collaborative culture. Additionally, MacGregor Read, after over 20 years serving in various operational roles culminating with his time as our Vice Chairman, transitioned to a new non-executive role as the Vice Chairman of our board of directors on April 1, 2020.
OUR GROWTH STRATEGIES
We plan to continue to drive sales growth and profitability by maintaining a relentless focus on our value proposition and executing on the following strategies:
•Drive Comparable Sales Growth. We expect that our compelling value proposition will continue to attract new customers, drive repeat visits, increase basket sizes and, as a result, generate strong comparable store sales growth. We plan to:
◦Deliver More “WOW!” Deals and Expand Our Offerings. We intend to drive incremental traffic and increase our share of wallet by further leveraging our purchasing model. We continue to deepen existing and develop new supplier relationships to ensure that we are the preferred partner and the first call for opportunistic inventory. As a result, we believe there is a significant opportunity to source and offer more “WOW!” deals within existing and new product categories, thereby offering greater value and variety to customers.
◦Support IOs in Enhancing the “WOW!” Customer Experience. We continue to implement operational initiatives to support IOs in enhancing the customer experience. We develop and improve tools that provide IOs with actionable insights on sales, margin and customer behavior, enabling them to further grow their business. We seek to continuously improve our inventory planning tools to help IOs make better local assortment decisions while reducing out-of-stock items and losses related to product markdowns, throwaways and theft (“shrink”). We also regularly deploy updated fixtures, signage and enhanced in-store marketing to further improve the shopping experience, which we believe results in higher customer traffic and average basket sizes.
◦Increase Customer Awareness and Engagement. Our marketing strategy is focused on growing awareness, encouraging new customers to visit our stores and increasing engagement with all bargain-minded consumers. Our emphasis on digital marketing is enabling us to deliver specific and real-time information to our customers about the most compelling “WOW!” deals at their local store through our daily and weekly “WOW! Alerts”. Along with the IOs, we utilize social media to increase our brand affinity and interact with customers more directly on a daily basis. Looking forward, we see an opportunity to further personalize our digital communications to both increase engagement with our existing customers and introduce new customers to our stores.
•Execute on Store Expansion Plans. We believe the success of our stores across a broad range of geographies, population densities and demographic groups creates a significant opportunity to profitably increase our store count. Our new stores typically require an average net cash investment of approximately $2.0 million and realize a payback on investment within four years. Based on our experience, in addition to research conducted by eSite Analytics, we believe existing and neighboring states can support a total of approximately 1,900 stores. Our goal is to expand our store base by approximately 10% annually by penetrating existing and contiguous regions. Over the long term, we believe the market potential exists to establish 4,800 locations nationally.
▪Implement Productivity Improvements to Reinvest in Our Value Proposition. Our seasoned management team has a proven track record of growing our business while maintaining a disciplined cost structure. Over the past five years, we have made significant investments that have laid a solid foundation for future growth. We have implemented and will continue to identify and implement productivity improvements through both operational initiatives and system enhancements, such as category assortment optimization, improved inventory management tools and greater purchasing specialization. We intend to reinforce our value proposition and drive further growth by reinvesting future productivity improvements into enhanced buying and selling capabilities.
COMPANY HISTORY
Our founder, Jim Read, pioneered our opportunistic buying model in 1946 and subsequently developed the IO selling approach beginning in Redmond, Oregon in 1973. Grocery Outlet Holding Corp. was incorporated in Delaware on September 11, 2014. In 2014, an investment fund affiliated with Hellman & Friedman LLC (the “H&F Investor”) acquired approximately 80% of our common stock (the “2014 H&F Acquisition”) with management and family retaining approximately 20%. Since the 2014 H&F Acquisition, we have made significant investments in our corporate and distribution infrastructure to support our growth, expand the store base and reinvest in existing stores. In June 2019, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock (the “IPO”). Our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GO”. The H&F Investor distributed the remainder of its holdings in our common stock to its equity holders in May 2020 and held no interest in the Company as of January 2, 2021.
PROCUREMENT AND SUPPLY CHAIN
Procurement
Our flexible sourcing and supply chain model differentiates us from traditional retailers and allows us to provide customers quality, name-brand consumables and fresh products at exceptional values. We take advantage of opportunities to acquire merchandise at substantial discounts that regularly arise from order cancellations, manufacturer overruns, packaging changes and approaching “sell-by” dates. As strong stewards of our suppliers’ brands, we are a preferred partner of leading CPGs with a reputation for making rapid decisions, purchasing in significant volumes and creatively solving their inventory challenges. Our buying strategy is deliberately flexible to allow us to react to constantly changing opportunities.
Our centralized sourcing team, consisting of our purchasing and inventory planning groups have deep experience and decades-long relationships with leading CPG companies. Our team is highly selective when evaluating the growing number of opportunities available to us and maintains a disciplined yet solutions-oriented approach. We are always seeking out and developing new supplier relationships to acquire desirable products at discounts that excite our customers. Our inventory planning group collaborates with and supports our buyers to ensure we purchase the appropriate type and quantity of products in order to maintain adequate inventory levels in key product categories.
We believe that we have a leading share of the large and growing excess inventory market. As we grow, we expect to have even greater access to quality merchandise due to our increased scale, broader supplier awareness and expanded geographic presence. We also expect the supply of opportunistic products to continue to expand as incumbent CPGs continue to invest in new products, brands and marketing. Additionally, we believe that changing consumer preferences will continue to support the proliferation of small and innovative CPG brands, and allow us to add new suppliers to our network.
Opportunistically sourced products represent approximately half of our purchasing mix. We refer to our best opportunistic purchases as “WOW!” deals, which generally represent deep discounts of 40% to 70% relative to conventional retailers. These products generate customer excitement and typically sell quickly due to their compelling value. The short duration and continually changing nature of our “WOW!” deals create a treasure hunt environment and a sense of urgency for customers to find and stock up on those heavily discounted items before they sell out. Furthermore, our “WOW!” items encourage repeat shopper visits as customers return to stores to discover what new deals are available.
We supplement our opportunistic purchases with competitively priced everyday staples in order to provide a convenient shopping experience. We typically source these staple products (e.g., milk, eggs, sugar) from multiple suppliers to lower our costs and we avoid long-term supply commitments to maintain the flexibility to pursue opportunistic buys as they arise.
Supply Chain
Over time, we have honed our supply chain operations to support our opportunistic buying approach and to quickly and efficiently deliver products to our stores. We believe our supply chain flexibility enables us to solve suppliers’ inventory challenges and, therefore, obtain significant discounts on purchases. After agreeing to purchase product from a supplier, we move quickly to receive, process and distribute the goods. Our systems allow IOs real-time visibility to our inventory, significantly reducing time to shelf. IOs typically order multiple deliveries per week resulting in higher inventory turns, lower shrink and a frequent assortment of new products on shelf.
As further evidence of the flexibility of our supply chain and the value we provide suppliers, we have dedicated teams to handle unique situations in which products need to be reconditioned or relabeled for sale. These items may include products without a UPC label, goods labeled for another geography, or inventory with damaged packaging.
We distribute inventory through eight primary distribution centers. We operate three distribution centers and use five distribution centers operated by third parties. We have an in-house transportation fleet as well as strong transportation partner relationships that provide consistent performance and timely deliveries to our stores.
We intend to continue to invest in our distribution and logistics infrastructure in order to support our anticipated store growth over the long term. 
INDEPENDENT OPERATORS
IOs are independent business entities owned by one or more entrepreneurially minded individuals who typically live in the same community as their store and demonstrate a relentless focus on ordering and merchandising the best products for their communities, providing personalized customer service and driving improved store performance. The vast majority of the IOs operate a single store with most working as a two-person team. We encourage the IOs to establish local roots and actively participate in their communities to foster strong personal connections with customers.
We generally share 50% of store-level gross profits with IOs, thereby incentivizing them to aggressively grow their business and realize substantial financial upside. The independent operator agreement (the “Operator Agreement”) that we sign with each IO gives the IO broad responsibility over store-level decision-making. This decision-making includes merchandising, selecting a majority of products, managing inventory, marketing locally, directly hiring, training and employing their store workers and supervising store operations to carry out our brand’s commitment to superior customer service. As a result, our IO model reduces our fixed costs, corporate overhead and exposure to wage inflation pressures and centralized labor negotiations.
IOs leverage our national purchasing network, sophisticated ordering and information systems and field support in order to operate more efficiently. We facilitate collaboration among IOs to share best practices through company-wide and regional meetings, our IO intranet and other online and informal communications.
This combination of local decision-making supported by our purchasing expertise and corporate resources results in a “small business at scale” model that we believe is difficult for competitors to replicate. Our collaborative relationship with the IOs creates a powerful selling model allowing us to deliver customers exceptional value with a local touch.
As of January 2, 2021, 375 of our 380 stores were operated by IOs. We have entered into an Operator Agreement with each IO, which grants that IO a license to operate a particular Grocery Outlet Bargain Market retail store and to use our trademarks, service marks, trade names, brand names and logos under our brand standards. The Operator Agreement, along with our Best Business Practice Manual, defines our brand standards and sets forth the terms of the license granted to that IO. IOs have discretion to determine the manner and means for accomplishing their duties and implementing our brand standards. The success of this licensing arrangement depends upon mutual commitments by us and the IO to cooperate with each other and engage in practices that protect our brand standards and the reputation of our brand and enhance the sales, business and profit potential of the IO’s store.
The vast majority of the IOs operate a single store with most working as a two-person family team. We believe this team approach leverages complementary operator skill sets resulting in a greater connection with customers along with improved store operations and service levels. The Operator Agreement provides that either the IO or we may terminate the Operator Agreement for any reason on 75 days’ written notice, or may terminate the Operator Agreement immediately for cause.
IOs are responsible for operational decision-making for their store, including hiring, training and employing their own workers as well as ordering and merchandising products. The IO orders merchandise solely from us, which we, in turn, deliver to IOs on consignment. As a result, we retain ownership of all merchandise until the point in time that merchandise is sold to a customer. Under the Operator Agreement, IOs are given the right to select a majority of merchandise that is sold in their store. IOs choose merchandise from our order guide according to their knowledge and experience with local customer purchasing trends, preferences, historical sales and other related factors. 
IOs are able to uniquely display and merchandise product in order to appeal to their local customer base. IOs also have discretion to adjust pricing in response to local competition or product turns, provided that the overall outcome based on an average basket of items comports with our reputation for selling quality name-brand consumables and fresh products and other merchandise at significant discounts. IOs are expected to engage in local marketing efforts to promote their store and enhance the reputation and goodwill of the Grocery Outlet brand. To protect our brand and reputation, the Operator Agreement requires IOs to adhere to brand standards, including cleanliness, customer service, store appearance, conducting their business in compliance with all laws and observing requirements for storing, handling and selling merchandise.
As consignor of all merchandise, the aggregate sales proceeds belong to us. We, in turn, pay IOs a commission which is generally 50% of the store’s gross profit in exchange for the IO’s services in staffing and operating the store. Any spoiled, damaged or stolen merchandise, markdowns or price changes impact gross profit and therefore the IO’s commission. We generally split these losses equally with IOs. As a result, IOs are exposed to the risk of loss of such merchandise and are incentivized to minimize any such losses.
We lease and build out each Grocery Outlet location. Under the Operator Agreement, we provide IOs with the right to occupy the store premises solely to operate the retail store on the terms set forth in the Operator Agreement. The Operator Agreement specifies the retail store that the IO is entitled to operate, but it does not grant the IO an exclusive territory, restrict us from opening stores nearby, or give the IO preference to relocate to another store as opportunities arise. As the store tenant, we fund the build-out of the store including racking, refrigeration and other equipment and pay rent, common area maintenance and other lease charges. IOs must cover their own initial working capital requirements and acquire certain store and safety assets. IOs may fund their initial store investment from their existing capital, a third-party loan or, most commonly, through a loan from us (an "IO Note"). The IOs are required to hire, train and employ a properly trained workforce sufficient in number to enable the IO to fulfill its obligations under the Operator Agreement. IOs are responsible for expenses required for business operations, including all labor costs, utilities, credit card processing fees, supplies, taxes (i.e., withholding, contributions and payroll taxes and income taxes on commissions paid to them), fines, levies and other expenses attributable to their operations.
In a typical year, we field over 20,000 leads for prospective new IOs annually in pursuit of smart and entrepreneurially minded retail leaders to support our continued growth. After a robust screening and interview process, we select the top candidates to enter a rigorous Aspiring Operator in Training (“AOT”) program with the goal of potentially becoming an IO. AOTs receive on-the-job training as an employee of an experienced IO that applies to serve as a training store for us and teach the skills that they learned and now rely on to drive their own financial success. This gives AOTs the chance to experience first-hand what running a Grocery Outlet and managing employees will require. We supplement on-the-job training with classes at our headquarters, when available, and through online tutorials so that AOTs gain a thorough appreciation for an IO’s responsibilities and opportunities. Upon successful completion of the training program, AOTs submit business plans to apply for new stores as they become available. Those business plans generally include a competitive analysis of the local market, operational strategy, marketing plan and projected financial performance. Based on the strength of that business plan, including an AOT’s familiarity with the local market, we ultimately select an IO as new store opportunities open and facilitate the transition.
OUR STORES
As of January 2, 2021, our 380 total stores averaged approximately 14,000 square feet on the sales floor. Upon entering a store, customers are greeted by signage introducing the IOs, a tailored selection of fresh produce and other perishables, followed by a “Power Wall” displaying some of our most compelling “WOW!” offerings.
Our stores are neatly organized and well maintained with clear signage to guide the customer through our various departments such as produce, beer and wine and fresh meat and seafood. Specialized item price tags call attention to our “WOW!” deals and highlight our robust NOSH offerings. Upon checkout, a cashier “circles the savings” on each customer’s receipt, which reinforces the compelling value that we provide.
Stores are assorted and merchandised uniquely by IOs providing a “WOW!” treasure hunt shopping experience. A majority of the assortment in each Grocery Outlet store is selected by IOs based on local preference and shopping history while the remaining assortment is delivered to stores to support marketing circulars and manage “sell-by” dates. We have several customized systems and tools in place, including our ordering system that allows IOs to see our real-time inventory and provides ordering suggestions based on local store characteristics. IOs have broad autonomy to create unique merchandising displays highlighting their “WOW!” offerings which strengthens the local feel of each store.
EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES
We believe the success of our stores across a broad range of geographies, population densities and demographic groups creates a significant opportunity to profitably increase our store count. In fiscal 2020 we opened 35 new stores. We have a dedicated real estate team that utilizes a rigorous site selection process in order to source new store locations that generate strong overall returns.
We deploy a store model that generates robust store-level financial results, strong cash flow and powerful returns. We target new stores of between 15,000 and 20,000 total square feet with an average of 4,000 square feet of non-selling space at an average net cash investment of approximately $2.0 million including store buildout (net of contributions from landlords), inventory (net of payables) and cash pre-opening expenses. Based on our historical performance, we target sales of $5.5 million during the first year with sales increasing 25% to 30% cumulatively until reaching maturity in four to five years. Our underwriting criteria target an average year-four cash-on-cash return of approximately 35% and an average payback on investment within four years.
In the near term, we plan to grow our store base to capture whitespace in existing markets as well as contiguous regions. Based on our experience, in addition to research conducted by eSite Analytics, we believe existing and neighboring states can support a total of approximately 1,900 stores. Our goal is to expand our store base by approximately 10% annually by penetrating existing and contiguous regions. Over the long term, we believe the market potential exists to establish 4,800 locations nationally.
MARKETING
Our ability to consistently deliver “WOW!” deals that generate customer excitement is our strongest marketing tool. Our value proposition has broad appeal, with bargain-minded customers spanning all income levels and demographics. We promote brand awareness and drive customers to shop through centralized marketing initiatives along with local IO marketing efforts. As a result of this approach and local marketing campaigns funded by IOs, our marketing expense as a percent of sales is relatively low.
We focus our centralized marketing efforts primarily on digital ads, emailed “WOW! Alerts,” social media, television and radio commercials, print circulars and in-store and outdoor signage. Our cost-effective marketing approach is designed to build brand awareness and communicate specific in-store “WOW!” deals to drive customer traffic. Over time, we have increased the utilization of digital advertising, allowing us to more quickly develop, deploy and target marketing communications based on our changing inventories and store- specific deals. In addition to our digital ads, we distribute print circulars to align with major holidays and other key promotional events, such as our semi-annual wine sale. We also market via television, streaming television platforms and radio to specific markets to build brand awareness and highlight the value we provide. We reinforce these efforts with in-store price and item signage as well as outdoor marketing via billboards and truck wraps.
IOs develop and fund their local marketing plan to drive customer engagement. IO efforts include community outreach such as partnering with food banks, sponsoring youth athletic programs and offering discounts to veterans. In addition, IOs develop and manage their own social media marketing platforms, posting creative and compelling content to reinforce our fun and value-oriented image.
COMPETITION
We compete for consumer spend with a diverse group of retailers, including mass, discount, conventional grocery, department, drug, convenience, hardware, variety, online and other specialty stores. The competitive landscape is highly fragmented and localized; however, our customers most often cite Safeway as the retailer where they also shop for consumables. We see discount retailers of consumable products, which include Walmart, WinCo, Aldi and Lidl, as competitors given their broad product offerings at low prices relative to conventional grocery stores. We compete with both conventional grocery stores and discounters by offering an ever-changing selection of name-brand products in a fun, treasure hunt shopping environment at a significant discount.
Many competitors are attempting to attract customers by offering various forms of e-commerce. While we have embraced online and digital marketing, we have thus far not pursued e-commerce. Based on our extreme value pricing and lower average ticket, we do not believe that our model lends itself to e-commerce which we think emphasizes convenience over value and fun. We have prioritized our capital and organizational investments to deliver the deepest and most compelling in-store values and experience for customers.
Beyond competition for consumers, we compete against a fragmented landscape of opportunistic purchasers, including retailers (e.g., Big Lots and 99 Cents Only) and wholesalers to acquire excess merchandise for sale in our stores. Our established relationships with our suppliers along with our distribution scale, buying power, financial credibility and responsiveness often makes us the first call for available deals. Our direct relationships with suppliers have increased as we have grown, and we continuously strive to broaden our supplier network.
BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY
Our information systems provide a broad range of business process assistance and real-time data to support our purchasing and planning approach, merchandising team and strategy, multiple distribution center management, store and operational insight and financial reporting. We selected and developed these technologies to provide the flexibility and functionality to support our unique buying and selling model as well as to identify and respond to merchandising and operating trends in our business. 
Over time, we have modernized and added several systems that provide us additional functionality and scalability in order to better support operational decision-making. These investments include enhanced point of sale, warehouse management, human resource planning, business intelligence, vendor tracking and lead management, store communications, real estate lease management and financial planning and analysis systems. We believe the ongoing modernization, enhancement and maintenance of our systems have allowed us to support the growth in our business and store base. 
We modify, update and replace our systems and infrastructure from time to time, including by adding new hardware, software and applications; maintaining, updating or replacing legacy programs, converting to best-in-class systems; integrating new service providers; and adding enhanced new functionality, such as cloud computing technologies. In addition, we have a customized enterprise resource planning system, components of which have been replaced and additional components of which we anticipate will be replaced over the next several years, including our financial ledger, inventory management platform and product data warehouse system.
We have also built a series of tools that empower IOs to make intelligent decisions to grow their business from improving product ordering, reducing shrink, and gaining intelligence into their store performance and profitability. We believe these investments have resulted in valuable business insights and operational improvements. We anticipate making ongoing technology investments in order to drive further productivity and functionality improvements.
TRADEMARKS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We own federally registered trademarks related to our brand, including “GROCERY OUTLET BARGAIN MARKET”, “WOW!”, “NOSH” and “BARGAINS ON BRANDS YOU TRUST!” In addition, we maintain trademarks for the images of certain logos that we use, including the “GROCERY OUTLET BARGAIN MARKET” logo, the “NOSH” logo and the “WOW!” logo. We are also in the process of pursuing several other trademarks to further identify our services such as “BARGAIN BLISS”, “FEELS LIKE FALLING IN LOVE IN EVERY AISLE”, “THE SAVINGS ARE REAL, THE FEELING IS PURE BLISS” and “HIP HIP SYRAH.” We have disclaimed the terms “GROCERY OUTLET” and “MARKET” with respect to our “GROCERY OUTLET BARGAIN MARKET” trademarks, among other disclaimed terms with respect to our registered trademarks and trademark applications. 
Our trademark registrations have various expiration dates; however, assuming that the trademark registrations are properly renewed, they have a perpetual duration. We also own several domain names, including www.groceryoutlet.com and www.ownagroceryoutlet.com, and registered and unregistered copyrights in our website content. Our Operator Agreement grants the IOs a limited, non-exclusive license to use our trademarks solely in connection with the operation and promotion of their store and not in connection with other activities. IOs are not permitted to sublicense our trademarks to others. We attempt to obtain registration of our trademarks as practical and pursue infringement of those marks when appropriate. We rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade-secret protection and confidentiality, license and other agreements with the IOs, suppliers, employees and others to protect our intellectual property.
REGULATION
We and the IOs are subject to regulation by various federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”) the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency. We and the IOs are subject to various laws and regulations, including those governing labor and employment, including minimum wage requirements, advertising, privacy, safety and environmental protection and consumer protection regulations, including those that regulate retailers and/or govern product standards, the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of stores and warehouse facilities. In addition, we and the IOs must comply with provisions regulating health and sanitation standards, food labeling, licensing for the sale of food and alcoholic beverages. We actively monitor changes in these laws. In addition, we and the IOs are subject to environmental laws pursuant to which we and the IOs could be strictly and jointly and severally liable for any contamination at our current or former locations, or at third-party waste disposal sites, regardless of our knowledge or responsibility for such contamination.
Food and Dietary Supplements—The FDA regulates the safety of certain food and food ingredients, as well as dietary supplements under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”). Similarly, the USDA’s Food Safety Inspection Service ensures that the country’s commercial supply of meat, poultry, catfish and certain egg products is safe, wholesome and correctly labeled and packaged. 
The Food Safety Modernization Act (the “FSMA”) amended the FDCA in 2011 and expanded the FDA’s regulatory oversight of all supply chain participants. Most of the FDA’s promulgating regulations are now in effect and mandate that risk-based preventive controls be observed by the majority of food producers. This authority applies to all domestic food facilities and, by way of imported food supplier verification requirements, to all foreign facilities that supply food products.
The FDA also exercises broad jurisdiction over the labeling and promotion of food. Under certain circumstances, this jurisdiction extends even to product-related claims and representations made on a company’s website or similar printed or graphic media. All foods, including dietary supplements, must bear labeling that provides consumers with essential information with respect to standards of identity, net quantity, nutrition facts, ingredient statements and allergen disclosures. The FDA also regulates the use of structure/function claims, health claims, nutrient content claims and the disclosure of calories and other nutrient information for frequently sold items. In addition, compliance dates on various nutrition initiatives that will impact many supply chain participants, such as in relation to partially hydrogenated oils, are scheduled to go into effect through 2021.
The FDA has comprehensive authority to regulate the safety, ingredients, labeling and good manufacturing practices for dietary supplements. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (the “DSHEA”) amended the FDCA in 1994 and expanded the FDA’s regulatory authority over dietary supplements. Through DSHEA, dietary supplements became a regulated commodity while also allowing structure/function claims on products. However, no statement on a dietary supplement may expressly or implicitly represent that it will diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent a disease.
Food and Dietary Supplement Advertising—The FTC exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of foods and dietary supplements. The FTC has the power to impose monetary sanctions, consent decrees and/or other penalties that can severely limit a company’s business practices. In recent years, the FTC has instituted numerous enforcement actions against companies carrying dietary supplements for failure to have adequate substantiation for claims made in advertising or for the use of false or misleading advertising claims.
Compliance—As is common in the retail industry, we rely on our suppliers and manufacturers to ensure that the products they manufacture and sell to us comply with all applicable regulatory and legislative requirements. In general, our purchase orders require that suppliers be compliant and represent and warrant to compliance with laws and require indemnification and/or insurance from our suppliers and manufacturers.
However, even with adequate insurance and indemnification, any claims of non-compliance could significantly damage our reputation and consumer confidence in products we sell. In addition, the failure of such products to comply with applicable regulatory and legislative requirements could prevent us from marketing the products or require us to recall or remove such products from our stores. In order to comply with applicable statutes and regulations, our suppliers and manufacturers have from time to time reformulated, eliminated or relabeled certain of their products.
We also source a portion of our products from outside the United States. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies and our supplier compliance agreements mandate compliance with applicable law, including these laws and regulations.
INSURANCE
We maintain third-party insurance for a number of risk management activities, including workers’ compensation, general liability, commercial property, ocean marine, crime, director and officer and employee, property and cargo and stock related insurance policies. We evaluate our insurance requirements on an ongoing basis to ensure we maintain adequate levels of coverage. The Operator Agreement requires IOs to maintain general liability and workers’ compensation insurance coverage for their operations.
EMPLOYEES
Our people are at the heart of who we are and what we do. They are key to achieving our business goals and growth strategy. As of January 2, 2021, we had 946 employees, 774 of whom were full-time and 172 of whom were part-time. As of January 2, 2021, 392 of our employees were based at either our corporate headquarters in Emeryville, California, or in our Leola, Pennsylvania office. Of those employees, 131 were classified as field employees. As of January 2, 2021, our distribution centers employed 337 persons. The remaining 217 employees were employees in our Company-operated stores. As of January 2, 2021, 126 of our employees were represented by a labor union, all of whom were employees at two Company-operated stores. We have not experienced any material interruptions of operations due to disputes with our employees and consider our relations with our employees to be very good.
Our mission is to Touch Lives for the Better. To do this, we work together to foster a culture grounded in talented and passionate people who live our values: entrepreneurship, integrity, achievement, family, service to others, diversity and fun. Our values translate into our human capital offerings to recruit, engage, develop, reward and retain employees who believe in our mission and emulate our values. We provide compensation and benefits programs designed to recruit such talent and to be competitive in the marketplace. Under its charter, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for establishing, implementing and evaluating our employee compensation and benefit programs. We also invest resources to develop our employee's skill sets.
We are steadfastly committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We offer our employees and their families access to a variety of health and wellness programs, including benefits (i) that provide protection and security so they can have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that impact their financial well-being; (ii) that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors; and (iii) that offer choice where possible so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented safety precautions that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, and which comply with government regulations. These measures included having certain of our employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work.
We strive to nurture and uphold an inclusive, diverse environment free from discrimination of any kind, including sexual or other discriminatory harassment. Our employees are encouraged to openly share questions and concerns they may have with management or Human Resources and they have multiple avenues available through which inappropriate behavior can be reported, including a confidential hotline. All reports of inappropriate behavior are promptly investigated with appropriate action taken as necessary. We make it very clear that retaliation against an employee for raising a concern in good faith is prohibited. 
We believe that a diverse and inclusive team is critical to our long-term business success. We have a number of employee networks and initiatives that enhance our inclusive and diverse culture, including our Black Partnership Network, our WOW! (Winning with Outstanding Women) Network, our Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Council, and by providing regular training on diversity topics. We will continue to focus on hiring, retaining and advancing women and underrepresented populations, and cultivating an inclusive and diverse corporate culture through continued education, employee resource groups and targeted recruiting and development across our organization.
The commitment by Grocery Outlet to our communities extends well beyond our offices. We pride ourselves on giving back to local communities. In 2020, through a coordinated effort with our IOs involving food, cash and online donations, we held our 10th Annual Independence from Hunger food drive, which supported over 400 nonprofit agencies and helped reduce food insecurity within the communities in which we operate.
