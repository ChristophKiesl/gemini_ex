ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
------------+---------

General 
 
Please see “Our Future Business” below regarding material information and updates that in many material respects superseded and modify the following general business description.
 
Superconductor Technologies Inc (“STI”) is a leading company in developing and commercializing high temperature superconductor (“HTS”) materials and related technologies. Superconductivity is the unique ability to conduct electricity with little or no resistance when cooled to “critical” temperatures. HTS materials are a family of elements that demonstrate superconducting properties at temperatures significantly warmer than previous superconducting materials. Electric currents that flow through conventional conductors encounter resistance. This resistance requires power to overcome and generates heat. HTS materials can substantially improve the performance characteristics of electrical systems, reduce power loss, and lower heat generation providing extremely high current carrying density and zero resistance to direct current.
 
We were established in 1987 shortly after the discovery of HTS materials. Our stated objective was to develop products based on these materials for the commercial marketplace.
 
After analyzing the market opportunities available, we decided to develop products for the utility and telecommunications industries.
 
Our initial product was completed in 1998 and we began delivery to a number of wireless network providers. In the following 13 years, we continued to refine and improve the platform, with the primary focus on improving reliability, increasing performance and runtime, and most importantly, removing cost from the manufacturing process of the required subsystems. Our cost reducing efforts led to the invention of our proprietary, high-yield and high throughput HTS material deposition manufacturing process.
 
In early 2018, we announced the concentration of our future Conductus wire product development efforts on NGEM to capitalize on several accelerating energy megatrends. This refined focus is very synergistic with our program with the Department of Energy (DOE) award for the development of superconducting wire to enable NGEM.
 
On January 28, 2020, we announced a cost reduction plan for the purpose of aligning our personnel needs and capital requirements as we explored strategic alternatives previously announced. We have maintained operations of our Sapphire Cryocooler cryogenics initiatives while ceasing additional manufacturing of our HTS Conductus® wire. The plan also included a 70% employee workforce reduction.
 
Subsequent to the announcement on January 28, 2020 about our cost reduction plan, we started the process of selling, in separate transactions, assets that we deemed non-essential going forward. The latest such transaction entered into on March 5th, when considered in combination with the prior transactions since January 28, 2020, may be deemed a material definitive purchase agreement for sales of various production, R&D, and testing equipment and selected intellectual property related primarily to our superconducting wire initiative. The aggregate sales prices of the post January 28th transactions was approximately $1,075,000, all sold to purchasers having no affiliation with us.
 
As a result of these sales, we no longer have the ability to resume HTS wire operations without significant new investments and restructured operations and a new HTS wire business plan, neither of which we currently intend to pursue, as we instead focus our efforts on completing the Merger (as defined below).
 
Our Future Business 
 
On February 26, 2020, we entered into a definitive merger agreement with Allied Integral United, Inc. (which will change its name to, and is therefore referred herein as, “Clearday”), a privately-held company dedicated to delivering next generation longevity care and wellness services, whereby our wholly-owned subsidiary will merge with and into Clearday in a stock-for-stock transaction with Clearday (the “Merger”), with Clearday surviving and becoming our wholly-owned subsidiary, which will then change its name to Clearday, Inc (the “Merger Agreement”).
 
As previously disclosed, on May 12, 2020, the Merger Agreement was amended by the parties to (i) add a covenant that the parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause STI to at all times remain listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market (or higher tier) and that if STI ceases to be listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market then the parties shall (including after the closing of the Merger) use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause STI to become listed on either the Nasdaq Capital Market or the NYSE MKT as promptly as reasonably possible, (ii) remove the conditions to closing the Merger that Nasdaq must determine that all listing deficiencies have been cured and determine to approve the listing of STI’s common stock on the Nasdaq and remove any other provisions in the Merger Agreement of like effect, (iii) extend the “outside date” for the Merger to close until the close of business on September 21, 2020 and (iv) require a customary tax representation letter from STI as a closing condition

As previously disclosed, due to our failure to comply with its listing conditions, the Nasdaq Stock Market notified us that it intended to complete the delisting of our common stock by filing a Form 25 Notification of Delisting with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which it did on February 2, 2021. Our common stock is no longer listed on a National Securities Exchange. Our stock trades on the OTC QB Market.
 
As also previously disclosed, we announced that, although the “outside date” of our Merger Agreement with Clearday has expired, both the Company and Clearday intended to finalize an amendment to the Merger Agreement or enter into a new merger agreement and proceed with the merger. Clearday has informed us that the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq would not be a condition to the closing of the merger. The parties are negotiating a new merger agreement (instead of an extension to the Merger Agreement) that would result in a similar all stock reverse acquisition of us, however there is no assurance that the parties will complete such negotiation successfully or conclude the merger or any transaction at all.
 
On February 3, 2021, Clearday paid us $120,000 as a good faith, non-refundable, payment to provide us cash flow support as we negotiate a new merger agreement.
 
As discussed below, on February 26, 2021, we also obtained a Paycheck Protection Program loan of approximately $468,000. We believe these funds will be sufficient to conclude a merger with Clearday, if one can be negotiated and our shareholders approve the transaction by the third quarter of 2021. There is no assurance that this will occur and indeed there are significant risks that it will not occur.
 
If a merger is consummated with Clearday, of which there is no assurance, the merged company will focus on the development of Clearday’s non-residential daily care service model as well as the continued operation of Clearday’s existing Memory Care America residential memory care facilities. As part of plans to develop and expand its assortment of innovative, non-residential daily care services, Clearday intends to leverage our existing Cryogenic Cooler as an enabling technology for one of its service offerings in the healthcare market.
 
If a merger is not consummated with Clearday in the near future, we will likely be required to liquidate or declare bankruptcy, in which case there would likely be no payments to common stock holders.
 
Our Proprietary Technology 
 
Our development efforts over the last 30 years have yielded an extensive patent portfolio as well as critical trade secrets, unpatented technology and proprietary knowledge. We have an extensive patent portfolio in addition to critical trade secrets, unpatented technology and proprietary knowledge. In June 2016, we were awarded U.S. Patent No. 9,362,025 from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) further protecting our unique capabilities for improving the performance of our Conductus superconducting wire in applications that utilize the advantages for operating in the presence of high magnetic field. In February 2017 we were awarded two patents from the USPTO: U.S. Patent No. 9,564,258, associated with U.S. Patent No. 9,362,025, providing additional protection for the foundation from which we will build high performance wire for our customers, and U.S. Patent No. 9,567,661 protecting the system design developed by STI to improve monitoring efficiency when evaporating materials in vacuum. In July 2017, EU patent 2188495 (08797906.8) was granted, this patent follows the U.S. Patent granted by U.S. 8,607,560. This patent is focused on METHOD FOR CENTERING RECIPROCATING BODIES AND STRUCTURES MANUFACTURED THEREWITH, related to our Sapphire Cryocooler. Our current patents expire at various dates from 2020 to 2034. We enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, suppliers and consultants to protect our proprietary information.
 
We have sold most of patents related to our HTS wires business subsequent to January 28, 2020, but retain patents related to our Sapphire Cryocooler technology.
 
Other Assets and Investments 
 
As mentioned in above, On January 28, 2020, we announced a cost reduction plan for the purpose of aligning our personnel needs and capital requirements as we explored strategic alternatives previously announced, while ceasing additional manufacturing of our HTS Conductus® wire and ceasing work on our DOE contract.
 
In 2007, we formed a joint venture with Hunchun BaoLi Communication Co. Ltd. (“BAOLI”) for the purpose of manufacturing and selling our SuperLink interference elimination solution in China. The joint venture was subsequently terminated prior to our joint venture partner and us providing our capital and technology contributions and our obligations were terminated.

Licenses 
 
We grant licenses for our technology to other companies. We have granted licenses to, among others, (1) Bruker for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance application, (2) General Dynamics for government applications, (3) Star Cryoelectronics for Superconducting Quantum Interference Device applications and (4) Theva for network infrastructure wireless electronic devices.
Government Contracts 
 
For 2020, 2019 and 2018, government related contracts accounted for 95%, 99% and 100%, respectively, of our revenues.
 
Manufacturing 
 
Our manufacturing process involved the operation of sophisticated production equipment and material handling by production technicians. We purchased inventory components and manufacture inventory based on existing customer purchase requests, and to a lesser extent, on sales forecasts. Our Austin, Texas facility addressed our growth expectations for our superconducting wire initiative. The opening of that facility coincided with the delivery of our first superconducting wire production equipment in early 2012.
 
On January 28, 2020, we announced we were ceasing manufacturing of our Conductus wire.
 
Historically, a number of components used in our products were available from only a limited number of outside suppliers due to unique designs, as well as certain quality and performance requirements. We did not have guaranteed supply arrangements with any of these suppliers, did not maintain an extensive inventory of parts or components and customarily purchase sole or limited source parts and components pursuant to purchase orders. Our reliance on sole or limited source suppliers involved certain risks and uncertainties, many of which were beyond our control, and some of which were set out in our public filings, including in particular the “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A of this Report.
 
Marketing and Sales 
 
We utilized a direct selling model due to the concentrated customer base for superconducting wire.
 
Competition 
 
We faced competition in various aspects of our technology and product development. Our products competed on the basis of performance, functionality, reliability, pricing, quality and compliance with industry standards. Our primary competitors include American Superconductor (AMSC), SuperPower (Furukawa), SuNam, Bruker, Shanghai Superconductor, BASF, SuperOx, Fujikura, Sumitomo, Shanghai Creative Superconductor Technologies Co., Ltd (SCSC), Oxolutia, MetOx, THEVA, Showa Cable Systems (SWCC), and Suzhou Advanced Materials Research Institute (SAMRI).
Research and Development 
 
Our 2018 through 2020 research and development activities were focused entirely on developing our Conductus wire product. We spent a total of $178,000, $2.4 million and $2.4 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, on research and development.
Environmental Issues 
 
We used certain hazardous materials in our research, development and manufacturing operations. As a result, we were subject to stringent federal, state and local regulations governing the storage, use and disposal of such materials. Current or future laws and regulations could require substantial expenditures for preventative or remedial action, reduction of chemical exposure, waste treatment or disposal. Although we believe that our safety procedures for the handling and disposing of hazardous materials complied with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, there is always the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. To date, we have not incurred substantial expenditures for preventive action with respect to hazardous materials or for remedial action with respect to any hazardous materials accident.
Corporate Information 
 
Our facilities and principal executive offices are located at 15511 W State HWY 71, Suite 110-105, Austin, TX 78738 and our telephone number will be (512) 650-7775. We were incorporated in Delaware on May 11, 1987. Additional information about us is available on our website at www.suptech.com. The information on our web site is not incorporated herein by reference.
Employees and Human Capital
 
Between January 28, 2020 and March 5, 2020, we sold substantially all of our assets, and reduced the number of our employees to three. Our three executive officers are our only current employees, and we do not plan to either expand or reduce our headcount. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
Backlog 
 
Our commercial backlog consisted of accepted product purchase orders with scheduled delivery dates during the next twelve months. We had no commercial backlog at December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019.
