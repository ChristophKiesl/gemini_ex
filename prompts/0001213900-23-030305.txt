Overview



PARTS iD, Inc. is a technology-driven, digital commerce company focused on creating custom infrastructure and unique user experiences within niche markets. The Company was founded in 2008 with a vision of creating a one-stop digital commerce destination for the automotive parts and accessories market. Management believes that the Company has since become a market leader and proven brand-builder, fueled by its commitment to delivering an engaging shopping experience; comprehensive, accurate and varied product offerings; and continued digital commerce innovation.



At its core, the Company’s technology solution is a data and information platform that enables and facilitates a differentiated digital commerce experience within complex product markets, as opposed to a pure digital commerce or electronics retailer. The deep technology platform that we have built integrates software engineering with catalog management, data intelligence, mining and analytics, along with user interface development that utilizes distinctive rules-based parts fitment software capabilities. In order to handle the ever-growing need for accurate automotive product and parts data, the Company has utilized cutting-edge computational and software engineering techniques, including Bayesian classification, to enhance and improve data records and product information and also deliver an engaging user experience. The technology platform also offers the Company fungibility, which was demonstrated by the fact that it was able to launch seven additional verticals in August 2018.

Through the journey of building a comprehensive and complex product portfolio with approximately 18 million SKUs, as well as building an end-to-end digital commerce platform, the Company has developed a platform for both digital commerce and fulfillment, relying on insights gleaned from over 14 billion data points related to vehicle parts, a virtual shipping network comprising over 2,500 locations, over 5,000 active brands, and machine-learning algorithms for complex fitment industries such as vehicle parts and accessories.



While the Company’s platform has been initially focused on automotive parts and accessories, management believes the Company’s platform is scalable and can be applied to other complex, multi-dimensional fitment, product portfolio industries, in addition to the seven parts and accessories verticals — semi-truck, motorcycle, powersports, RV/camper, boating, recreation and tools — that we launched in August 2018.







The Company has positioned these verticals under its existing “iD” brand and believes this will drive brand loyalty among customers and reputation among vendors, ultimately increasing online traffic, brand visibility, and customer orders for adjacent markets. The Company has since experienced growth in revenue related to the additional verticals, our original equipment (“OE”) business, and our repair parts business.



Customer service is a key aspect of the experience the Company offers to its customers throughout their buying journey. The Company has specialized customer support teams which assist customers in navigating through the platform, addressing any technical questions, order tracking and completing the order.



Digital Commerce Platform



The Company’s digital commerce platform was developed in-house from inception as a solution for industries with data limitations and parts fitment complexities, all while making processes simpler and more efficient. A core differentiator of the Company’s digital commerce platform is its purpose-built and proprietary data catalog developed over more than a decade by collecting, analyzing and refining data regarding original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, vehicles and aftermarket products and customer feedback to define a universe of accurate Year-Make-Model, or YMM, values. Management believes this functionality creates a unique user experience path that drives purchase intelligence and increases consumer confidence and trust.

The Company’s in-house data catalog houses over 14 billion data points for automobiles and the Company’s other seven verticals. This data catalog is designed to tie vehicles with parts that fit their specific YMM, including the variations of sub-model, engine size, transmission type and drivetrain type, as well as to recommend complementary products, such as tools required to install purchased parts and accessories. To build its catalog, the Company aggregates data from multiple sources, cross-pollinates this data to address any gaps in data sets, enriches the catalog using its proprietary internal data, then applies artificial intelligence to make further improvements. Through this process, the Company’s data catalog can: (i) determine the exact parts fitment for a product by its parameters, even if certain fitment details are originally missing in manufacturers’ data feeds; and (ii) rapidly incorporate new SKUs as they become available. Because its data catalog is continually expanding with each customer interaction, the Company also can offer better purchase recommendations, increase up-sell opportunities, improve the efficiency of its fulfillment operations, and lower errors and mistakes in orders. These economic and commercial advantages result in a fly-wheel effect that increases operating leverage and momentum. Because the cost of operating the Company’s data catalog is largely fixed, the Company has been able to expand its customer offerings into adjacent categories at relatively low incremental costs. The Company’s in-house catalog and deep understanding of fitment data helps offer a personalized and tailored experience to its diverse customer base of DIY, DIFM and PRO (mechanics) customers. The Company is committed to providing an enhanced customer experience and becoming a one-stop shop and seamless solution for all vehicle enthusiast needs.



Product Vendors



The Company provides its product vendors with access to its large customer base and e-commerce market. The Company’s 1000+ product vendors can leverage the Company’s disruptive technology, enhanced fitment data, deep understanding of the market and large customer database to sell and position their innovative product catalog instantly. Product vendors can benefit from the Company’s engaging shopping experience, advanced 3D imagery, in-depth product description, reviews, installation guides and other tailored content offered by the Company’s platform, complemented by specialized customer service.
Fulfillment Operations



The Company’s virtual, proprietary, and capital-efficient fulfillment model manages its sales volume while carrying minimal inventory, which is primarily associated with its private label products. The Company’s platform, which incorporates live or frequently updated inventory feeds from our product vendors, provides stock-on-hand for approximately 18 million products across over 5,000 active brands. The Company’s fulfillment model decides which product vendor to source from while the sale is made based on a proprietary algorithm, which incorporates factors such as availability of inventory, customer proximity, shipping cost and profitability. This decentralized, data-driven approach allows the Company to increase delivery speed through more than 2,500 shipping points from its U.S. vendor network.
Products



The Company primarily sells automotive parts and accessories, including a wide range of goods from automobile accessories, wheels and tires, performance parts, lighting, and repair parts. In addition, the Company launched seven new verticals in August 2018 and in 2022 the value of the orders received from these verticals was approximately 9.0% of the Company’s total order value. These seven verticals offer parts and accessories for semi-trucks, motorcycles, powersports (including ATVs, snowmobiles, and personal watercraft), RVs/campers, boats, recreation (including outdoor sports and camping gear) and tools using the same proprietary platform.

The Company primarily sources its products from industry leading brands and product vendors located in the U.S., except that its private label products are largely sourced from foreign product vendors. Regarding sales of products sourced from our product vendors, no single product vendor accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company’s inventory on hand, which largely relates to private label products, was approximately $1.5 million as of December 31, 2022 and $1.7 million in value as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the sale value of customers’ unshipped and undelivered orders were $3.1 million and $15.5 million, respectively.



Private Label Product. The Company’s private label business uses proprietary data to identify, import and sell higher margin products that are in demand on its platform. Management believes that by selecting and pairing a superior import product with its purpose-built and proprietary data catalog, consumers are provided the option to purchase a high-quality product at a reasonable cost. Private label revenue was less than 10% of the Company’s total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Branded Product. The Company has developed and implemented application-programming interfaces with the majority of its drop-ship product vendors that allow it to electronically transmit orders, check inventory availability, and receive the shipment tracking information and share it with its customers. These processes allow the Company to offer over 5,000 brands on an inventory-free basis, thereby reducing carrying costs and improving margins.
Industry and Market Opportunity



The Company’s management believes the U.S. aftermarket automotive market is massive, fragmented, and ripe for disruption as overall consumer preferences are increasingly shifting to online transactions. Although the ultimate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic remain uncertain and consumer demand for automobile parts and accessories may be impacted in a recessionary environment. The auto aftermarket continues to have an upward trend despite economic pressures of inflation.



According to Hedges & Company, the light duty auto parts industry is projected to be $374 billion in 2023, which includes parts and service. The entire automotive aftermarket/auto care industry, including medium and heavy-duty parts and services, is projected to be $497 billion in 2023.



The outlook is mixed per Market Research SEMA Future Trends 2023 Report (the “SEMA Report”) issued in January 2023. In 2021, demand for specialty-aftermarket parts was strong, with some companies recording their best sales ever. Retail sales hit a record high of $50.9 billion, over 6% from 2020. This was despite looming challenges on the horizon which materialized more in 2022, such as rising inflation and supply-chain challenges—both of which led to lower inventories and higher prices. Additionally, consumers had more options to spend their money on, as most sectors of the economy that closed during the pandemic were open once again. The SEMA Report projected that sales growth slowed in 2022 to around 2%. Looking forward, we expect both prices and supply-chain issues should normalize. Slow vehicle sales will likely push consumers to hold onto their vehicles longer and purchase more aftermarket parts. As a result, unless economic conditions change significantly, the industry is expected to return to normal growth levels of 3% to 4% in 2023 and beyond depending on what happens to the economy over the coming year and how will affect consumer spending. Economic slowing towards the end of 2023 is projected and potentially a recession as the Federal Reserve attempts to combat inflation. However, if the recession is deeper and more severe, then projections for the industry as well as other sectors will end up being more pessimistic. However, we believe the industry remains optimistic about the near future.

The SEMA Report also stated that despite increasing inventory levels, the average price for new vehicles continues to grow. The average transaction price, without applied consumer incentives, hit $49,507 in December 2022—the highest price on record. Ultimately, these prices as well as increasing interest rates are putting downward pressure on sales for dealers and automakers across the country. However, interest rates are likely to remain high for a while as the Federal Reserve tries to lower inflation. The average interest rate for a new vehicle was 5.16%. This, along with the fact that model availability is still limited make it difficult for consumers to purchase new right now. Like the market for new vehicles, used-vehicle sales are also down. Sales for 2022 are projected to have finished more than 4 million units below their 2021 levels. Consumers keep their vehicles longer as they buy new vehicles less, which means less used inventory is available and puts upward pressure on prices. On top of this, interest rates for used vehicles on average are even higher than those for a new vehicle loan. As with new-vehicle sales, we project that it will take until 2025 for used-vehicle sales to return to their pre-pandemic levels of around 40 million units per year. Similar to new light vehicles in the United States, it’s expensive to buy a used vehicle as well. As of November 2022, the average price of a used vehicle was $27,143. On top of this, the average interest rate on a used-car loan is exceptionally high at 9.34% (December 2022), significantly higher than that for a new vehicle. These prices, along with diminished inventory, are helping to soften sales as well. Now that used-vehicle sales have cooled off, prices are expected to normalize and become less volatile over the next year or two. Off-road products and accessories are a significant segment for the specialty equipment industry, with most companies seeing a lot of opportunity. Pickups and SUVs (especially the Jeep Wrangler) are commonly accessorized for off-road applications. In fact, 62% of pickup owners buy off-road parts or take their vehicles off-road. Around 80% use their pickup for outdoor recreation uses. A relatively new trend in the specialty-equipment industry is overlanding. Off-roading and overlanding overlap a fair degree, but overlanding refers to a combination of remote travel, off-roading and camping. When it comes to our industry, overlanding products would include things like mounted tents. Overall, our industry sees opportunity in overlanding, but less than it does in the off-road segment.



Overlanding has garnered a lot of attention at the past few SEMA Shows. Based on Google search trends, overlanding as a segment is a relatively new concept that didn’t become common until the end of 2018 and spiked at the beginning of the pandemic. Additionally, it’s mainly popular with states that have a lot of off-roading opportunities, especially Utah, Idaho, Montana, Colorado and the Pacific Northwest. Also, sports cars are some of the most accessorized and enthusiast-owned vehicles on the road today. While produced at much lower numbers than typical passenger cars, their accessorizers tend to modify them at a much higher rate, installing more specialty aftermarket parts on them than other segments. The top sports cars for accessorization are often termed muscle cars (most of which are American brands). However, sport compact “tuner” cars are also popular, and include models from Asia and Europe. The industry continues to see significant opportunity for both the muscle car and tuner markets. Fresh models, such as the Nissan Z and Toyota GR Supra, offer exciting new platforms for accessorization and modification.



Many companies within the specialty-equipment industry also see opportunity in the racing parts market. In 2021, racing parts accounted for $7.79 billion in part sales. Now that the country has mostly moved on from the pandemic and racing has resumed full time, parts sales within this market are expected to grow.



After a turbulent few years for the racing industry due to the pandemic, racing is moving into 2023 with significant momentum, and the industry is optimistic for the future. In 2023, 93% of racing part manufacturers, retailers and distributors expect sales to stay the same or grow—with 55% expecting a sales increase. When it comes to racetracks, 95% expect to host at least the same number of races in 2023, with 34% expecting to host more.

In addition to passenger cars and light trucks, the specialty-equipment industry also sees opportunity in selling parts for other powersport and recreational vehicles—especially ATVs and UTVs. This opens potential cross-selling opportunities in addition to selling parts for their car or truck.



The Company has historically focused specialty automotive equipment market but is seeking to accelerate its growth through automotive repairs, targeted international expansion and the addition of new verticals. The Company’s other product verticals present an aggregate market opportunity expected to exceede $100 billion.

Marketing



Management believes its customers’ core need is to find the right parts that fit their vehicle at the best price and are delivered on time. Our marketing strategies are designed around customer acquisition and retention which includes paid and non-paid advertising. Our paid advertising primarily includes search engine marketing, display, paid social media, and paid partnerships. Our non-paid advertising efforts include search engine optimization, non-paid social media and e-mail marketing.







The Company currently drives traffic to its platform primarily with search engines; 72% of the Company’s traffic and 60% of its revenue in 2022 was acquired in this manner. Once on the platform, customers are presented with the Company’s proprietary marketing and product content that is created via in-house, multi-step image and video processing. Automated image refinement and the Company’s creative design team work to ensure consistency and quality across all content, including the product images presented to customers on the Company’s platform. Product pages on the Company’s platform present customers with multiple, customized product choices, plus cross-sell and up-sell opportunities, as well as training materials, product comparison information, installation instructions and customer reviews. Customers have the option to shop and explore on the Company’s platform in multiple ways, including by part number, brand or product category.



Competition



The parts and accessories industries in which the Company sells its products are competitive and fragmented, and products are distributed through multi-tiered and overlapping channels. The Company competes with both online and offline sellers that offer parts and accessories, repair parts and OEM parts to either the DIY or the DIFM consumer groups. Current or potential competitors include (i) online retailers, including both niche retailers of uncommon, highly specialized products and general retailers of a larger number of broadly available products; (ii) national parts retailers such as Advance Auto Parts, AutoZone, NAPA and O’Reilly Auto Parts; (iii) internet-based marketplaces such as Amazon.com and eBay.com; (iv) discount stores and mass merchandisers; (v) local independent retailers; (vi) wholesale parts distributors and (vii) manufacturers, product vendors and other distributors selling online directly to consumers. The Company faces significant competition from these and other retailers in the United States and abroad. Most of these competitors are, and will be, substantially larger than the Company, and have substantially greater resources and operating histories. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to keep pace with the technological or product developments of its competitors. These companies also compete with the Company in recruiting and retaining highly qualified technical and professional personnel and consultants.



Competitive factors in the markets the Company serves include fitment data and related intelligence, technology, customer experience, customer service, range of product offerings, product availability, product quality, price and shipping speed. Management believes its custom-built tech-stack for the complex, multi-dimensional automotive parts and accessories industry, which offers over 5,000 active brands and approximately 18 million unique SKUs, provides it with a unique competitive advantage.



There are several key competitive strengths that management believes highlight the attractiveness of the Company’s platform business model and underscore how PARTS iD, Inc. is differentiated from its competition, including:




1. | The Company’s distinctive technology, customer-first UI, and proprietary fitment data that enables a differentiated shopping experience for the automotive parts consumer. Unlike any other consumer product category, we believe that the success or failure of selling automotive parts, and especially aftermarket accessories at scale, comes down to rich and comprehensive fitment data. We believe that the Company has been successful at developing its own proprietary fitment database which is not licensed for use to any other person or entity.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






7








2. | We believe that the Company’s product catalog of over eighteen million products and over forty-five hundred brands is unrivaled. Our comprehensive catalog is enriched with over fourteen billion data points, advanced 3D imagery, in-depth product descriptions, customer reviews, installation and fitment guides, as well as other rich custom content specifically catering to the needs of the automotive aftermarket industry and is further complemented by our highly trained and specialized customer service.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Company’s proprietary and asset-light fulfillment model has enabled us to grow organically without external capital. This platform model is enabled by a network of over one thousand suppliers which we have cultivated relationships with and integrated over the last fifteen years. This has enabled us to further scale our catalog size and to add adjacent verticals which allows us to offer a broader array of product lines over our competitors. Furthermore, our geo-sourcing fulfillment algorithm factors in real-time inventory when available, customer proximity, shipping cost, and profitability to optimize product sourcing. This algorithmic approach allows us to increase fill rate and delivery speed.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | The Company’s differentiated customer experience is a result of rich content, wide product range with ease of selection, proprietary fitment data, and highly trained customer service representatives, providing a data-driven engagement platform for discovery and inspiration. This is demonstrated by:
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


a. | the Company’s Net Promoter Score continues to be between 60 – 70;
---+------------------------------------------------------------------


b. | the Company’s overall product return rate across all eight verticals is consistently within the range of 5 - 6% versus industry averages of more than 20%; and
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


c. | repeat customer revenue was 34% of total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The Company has invested sixteen years in building its proprietary platform and we believe that our investment in technology and data has allowed us to expand into adjacent verticals, leveraging a capital-efficient just-in-time inventory model to offer our consumers an extensive selection and customer experience. 



Intellectual Property



The Company owns a number of trade names, service marks and trademarks, including “iD,” “CARiD,” “BOATiD,” “MOTORCYCLEiD,” “CAMPERiD,” “POWERSPORTSiD,” “TOOLSiD,” “TRUCKiD,” “RECREATIONiD” and more, for use in connection with its business. In addition, the Company owns and has registered trademarks for certain of its private label brands. Management believes these trade names, service marks and trademarks are important to the Company’s sales and marketing strategy.
Environmental Matters



The Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of its business, including those governing the use and transportation of hazardous substances and emissions-related standards, established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), and similar state-level regulators, including the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”).





8







While the Company has processes in place to ensure that products are sold in compliance with the requirements imposed by the EPA and similar state-level regulators, all verification processes have inherent limitations. The Company has been, is currently, and may in the future be the subject of regulatory proceedings initiated by the EPA, CARB or other applicable regulatory bodies, and the results of such proceedings are uncertain. For additional information, see Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



Although management believes that the Company is in substantial compliance with currently applicable environmental laws, rules, and regulations, it is unable to predict the ultimate impact of adopted or future laws, rules, and regulations on its business, properties or products. Such laws, rules, or regulations may cause the Company to incur significant expenses to achieve or maintain compliance, may require it to modify its product offerings, may adversely affect the price of or demand for some of its products, and may ultimately affect the way the Company conducts its operations. Failure to comply with these current or future laws, rules, or regulations could result in harm to the Company’s reputation and/or could lead to fines and other penalties, including restrictions on the importation of the Company’s products into, or the sale of its products in, one or more jurisdictions until compliance is achieved.



Seasonality



The Company’s revenue is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year, although sales typically spike during the spring months upon the distribution to the general public by the IRS of income tax refunds and during the winter holiday season. While the Company expects that seasonality will not have a significant impact on its sales, it recognizes that future revenues may be affected by these seasonal trends as well as cyclical trends affecting the overall economy, especially the automotive parts and accessories industry.
Employees



As of December 31, 2022, the Company employed 65 full-time employees, all in the United States. As of April 14, 2023, the Company employed 26 full-time employees, all in the United States. None of the Company’s employees are represented by a labor union, and management believes that the Company’s relations with its employees are good. Most of our call center, web-site development, IT infrastructure support and back-office services are provided by independent contractors in Ukraine, Belarus, Philippines, and Costa Rica. Our outside U.S. operations allow us to access requisite talent at a significantly lower cost compared to U.S.-based talent. In June 2022, we took steps to reduce our costs by reducing our employment base in the United States, and reducing our independent contractors in Ukraine, the Philippines, and Costa Rica, and by reducing other operating expenses. In February 2023, we announced that the Company reduced its employment base by two-thirds in the United States and similarly significantly reduced its independent contractors in Ukraine, Costa Rica and the Philippines. For more information, see “Note 14 – Subsequent Events” included elsewhere in this report.
