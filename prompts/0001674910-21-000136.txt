ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
Valvoline Inc. is a global vehicle and engine care company that continuously powers the future of mobility through innovative services and products for electric, hybrid, and internal combustion powertrains. The terms “Valvoline,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “management,” and “our” as used herein refer to Valvoline Inc., its predecessors and its consolidated subsidiaries, except where the context indicates otherwise. 
Established in 1866, Valvoline’s heritage spans over 15 decades, during which it has developed powerful recognition across multiple channels for its superior levels of service and original, high quality products. Valvoline has consistently led the way in innovating and reinventing its services and products for changing technologies and customer needs, including leading the world's supply of battery fluids to electric vehicle manufacturers. Valvoline operates a fast-growing, best-in-class network of service center stores, which are well positioned to serve evolving vehicle maintenance needs with Valvoline's iconic products. In addition to its quick, easy, and trusted quick lube oil change services and the legendary Valvoline-branded passenger car motor oils, Valvoline provides a wide array of lubricants, chemicals, fluids, and other complementary products and services designed to improve vehicle and engine performance and lifespan. 
Valvoline provides vehicle and engine care solutions to a range of customers, including end consumers, original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), mass market and automotive parts retailers, small to large installers, vehicle fleets, and distributors. Valvoline operates and franchises approximately 1,600 service center locations and is the second and third largest chain in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, respectively, by number of stores. With sales in more than 140 countries and territories, Valvoline’s solutions are available for every engine and powertrain, including high-mileage and heavy-duty applications, and are offered at more than 80,000 locations worldwide. 
Company background
Valvoline has a 155-year history of innovation that began in 1866 when Dr. John Ellis founded Valvoline by discovering the lubricating properties of distilled crude oil and formulated the world's first petroleum-based lubricant. Valvoline was trademarked seven years later in 1873, making it the first trademarked motor oil brand in the United States. Soon thereafter, as vehicle ownership rapidly grew, Valvoline became widely known in the automotive world through racing victories and as a recommended oil for the iconic Ford Model T, while expanding its product offerings and global reach through its innovative automotive maintenance and heavy-duty engine applications. 
Valvoline was acquired by Ashland (currently doing business as Ashland Global Holdings Inc. and referred to herein as “Ashland,” together with its predecessors and consolidated subsidiaries) in 1950 and continued accelerating through the development of all-climate and racing motor oils, in addition to notable automobile racing victories by some of the biggest legends of the sport. By the late 1980s, Valvoline began operating and franchising Valvoline Instant Oil Change (“VIOC”) service center stores, expanding into consumer-focused automotive preventive maintenance and quick lube services. In the late 1990s, Valvoline began its strategic relationship that continues today for co-branding products in heavy duty applications with Cummins Inc. (“Cummins”), a leading supplier of heavy-duty engines. Valvoline maintained its focus on innovating for evolving vehicle technologies and the needs of customers through the late 1990s and early 2000s by introducing synthetic and high-mileage motor oils. 
Valvoline was incorporated in May 2016 as a subsidiary of Ashland, followed by the transfer of the Valvoline business and certain other legacy Ashland assets and liabilities from Ashland to Valvoline (the “Contribution”). Valvoline completed its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of common stock in September 2016, and Ashland distributed its remaining interest in Valvoline in May 2017 (the “Distribution”). Today Valvoline operates as an independent global corporation that trades on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “VVV,” focused on further accelerating its growth and powering the future of mobility. 
On October 12, 2021, Valvoline announced that it is accelerating its continued transformation by pursuing a separation of its two business segments, Retail Services and Global Products. Valvoline is evaluating the alternatives to accomplish the separation, and no timetable has currently been established for its completion.

Industry overview
Demand for preventive automotive maintenance in both the automotive aftermarket services and the finished lubricants markets benefits from ongoing improvements in miles driven and the growing number and age of vehicles in operation, in addition to increasing vehicle complexity. 
The North American automotive aftermarket services total addressable market is highly fragmented which creates a significant opportunity for the non-cyclical, essential nature of Valvoline’s preventive-maintenance business. Retail Services is well-positioned to continue to increase its market share by leveraging its world-class service model and executing its three-pillar growth strategy of 1) expanding its footprint through new company-operated locations, acquisition opportunities, and franchise development, 2) leveraging proprietary data analytics and technology to drive effective marketing and a best-in-class customer experience, and 3) evolving its service offerings to capture growing opportunities in the market. 
Global lubricant demand is estimated to be approximately 12 billion gallons, which has stabilized during fiscal 2021 from the temporary decline during the depths of the coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic. Demand for passenger car motor oil and motorcycle oil is estimated to account for approximately 20% of global lubricant demand. Heavy-duty oil and other transport lubricants account for another 40%, while the remaining 40% of global lubricant demand is comprised of non-transport lubricants such as hydraulic oil, gear oil, process oil and greases. The United States has historically accounted for the largest portion of lubricant demand, but has recently been surpassed by China, with India third. The international lubricants market is more than three-and-a-half times the size of the North American market, creating significant opportunity for growth. The lubricants market is impacted by the following key drivers and trends:
•Global transportation lubricants market demand is shifting towards higher performance finished lubricants, largely driven by advancements in vehicle and engine design as well as more rigorous OEM and regulatory requirements for improved efficiency, optimized fuel consumption along with reduced carbon footprints and toxic emissions.
•Despite a recent decline in demand, which Valvoline believes was primarily the result of COVID-19 restrictions reducing miles driven, recent multiyear trends indicate that the North American transport lubricants market has experienced relatively flat to slightly declining average annual volumes due in part to an increase in oil change intervals, the result of a shift towards higher performance lubricants, offset by an increase in the number of automobiles on the road and miles driven.
•Continued growth in the number of vehicles on the road has led to expansion of passenger vehicle lubricant sales in developing regions.
Reportable segments
During the third quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company realigned its global operations to support its strategic initiatives to transition to a services-driven business. As a result of the realignment, Valvoline's reporting structure is composed of two reportable segments: Retail Services and Global Products. Additionally, to reconcile to consolidated results, certain corporate and other non-operational matters are included in Corporate. Each reportable segment is described below: 
Retail Services
The Retail Services segment serves the passenger car and light truck aftermarket through company-operated, independent franchises, and independent Express Care stores that service vehicles with Valvoline products. Valvoline operates the second largest quick lube service chain by number of stores in the United States with Valvoline Instant Oil ChangeSM and the third largest quick lube service chain in Canada with the Valvoline Great Canadian Oil Change brand. Valvoline’s service center stores offer customers a quick, easy and trusted way to maintain their vehicles, utilizing highly-trained technicians who have access to a proprietary service process that sets forth rigorous protocols for both the steps that must be followed in the service of vehicles and for interactions with customers. The Express Care™ platform supports smaller North American independent operators that do not fit Valvoline’s current franchise model and generally offer other services in addition to quick lubes, such as automotive repairs and car washes. 
As of September 30, 2021, the Retail Services system consisted of 1,594 service center stores, 719 company-operated and 875 franchised locations, that operate in 47 states in the U.S. and five provinces in Canada. Additionally, Retail Services serves Express Care™ locations throughout the U.S. and Canada and has invested in a domestic battery supply chain joint venture. Retail Services is focused on expanding its footprint and driving a best-in-class customer experience, while evolving its service offerings to capture growing opportunities in the market by growing non-oil change services, services for the future of mobility, and pursuing fleet service solutions to address medium and heavy-duty vehicles that require comprehensive maintenance needs. 
Global Products 
The Global Products segment sells Valvoline™ and other branded and private label engine and automotive preventive maintenance products in more than 140 countries and territories to mass market and automotive parts retailers, installers, and commercial customers, including distributors and licensees, as well as OEMs, to service light- and heavy-duty vehicles and equipment. Global Products operates across four primary regions that include North America (comprised of the United States and Canada); Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”); Latin America (which includes Mexico, Central and South America); and Asia Pacific (Australia and Asia, including India and China). Global Products has a growing presence in emerging and growth markets, such as China, India, and Latin America and has 50/50 joint ventures with Cummins in India, China and Argentina, as well as joint ventures with other partners in Latin America.
Sales of Valvoline products for consumers to perform their own automotive and engine maintenance are referred to as “Do-It-Yourself” or “DIY” consumers, and sales of Valvoline products for consumers to have their vehicles and equipment serviced are referred to as “Do-It-For-Me” or “DIFM” consumers. Sales for DIY consumers are primarily branded products sold through the DIY retail channel to customers such as retail automotive parts stores, as well as to leading mass merchandisers, independent automotive part stores, convenience stores, dollar stores, farm stores, grocers, and online retailers. Sales through the DIY retail channel also include non-branded packaged products sold to warehouse distributors that resell to both DIY consumers and to installers for DIFM consumers. Sales for DIFM consumers are generally sold through the installer channel to customers such as car dealers, general repair shops, third-party quick lube locations directly, as well as through a network of distributors and licensees. Valvoline also has a strategic relationship with Cummins for co-branding products for heavy duty customers, which include heavy-duty fleet customers, such as on-highway fleets and construction companies served primarily through the distributor network.
Business and growth strategies
Building on the momentum in fiscal 2021, Valvoline's business and growth strategic initiatives include:
•Executing the strategic separation of Valvoline's two business segments, Retail Services and Global Products, to create sustainable value for the Company's stakeholders and best position the segments for continued long-term success by allowing Retail Services to continue its growth and focus on leveraging its world class service model and providing Global Products with the opportunity to focus and allocate capital to its own strategic priorities; 
•Aggressively growing Retail Services through organic service center expansion, opportunistic acquisitions, and franchisee growth, while rapidly diversifying and expanding retail service offerings and capabilities through a quick, easy, and trusted customer experience delivered by hands-on experts; 
•Accelerating Global Products market share growth through continued development of and investment in key global emerging and high value markets by fully leveraging brand equity and product platforms to drive speed, efficiency, and value across the business and customer interactions, while increasing penetration of Valvoline’s full product portfolio;
•Expanding capabilities to serve future transport vehicles by continuing to develop relationships with electric vehicle OEMs and leveraging innovation in the delivery of future services and products in direct and adjacent markets; and
•Building a strong foundation enabled by data and technology to make Valvoline easy to do business with.

Refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis included in Item 7, as well as Risk Factors included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding the impact of COVID-19 on the Company and its business.
Retail Services store development
Valvoline continues to build its market share by leveraging its world class stay-in-your-car service model by providing each customer with superior service through its hands-on-expertise and the highest quality lubricants and complementary products. The SuperProTM system for executing Valvoline's retail services is built upon providing consistent quick, easy, and trusted preventive maintenance to build a high degree of customer loyalty. Valvoline's three-pronged growth strategy for its retail services is to grow through 1) opportunistic acquisitions, 2) new company-operations store development, and 3) franchisee expansion. The summary below highlights the unit growth within the Retail Services system over the last five years, in addition to its annual same-store sales growth in each of those years:

The Retail Services network of stores delivered its 15th consecutive year of system-wide same-store sales growth in fiscal 2021, demonstrating the system's operational excellence. Valvoline operated, either directly or through its franchisees, 1,594 service center stores as of September 30, 2021. 
The Retail Services system grew by nearly 50% over the last five years, the result of 285 net new openings and 241 acquired stores, which combined to add 526 net new stores from the beginning of 2017. Organic growth was driven by 108 net new company-operated service center store openings and franchisee expansion in key markets 
for 177 net new store openings. During this period, Valvoline became the franchisor of 116 retail stores through acquisition, which included the expansion of its service centers internationally into Canada, with the balance of stores acquired through single and multi-store acquisitions that also included the conversion of 144 stores within the system from franchises to company-operated service center stores.
Competition
The industry is highly competitive and Valvoline faces competition in all product and service categories and subcategories. Competition is based on several key criteria, including brand recognition, product performance, quality, price, availability, positioning, security of supply, customer service, as well as the ability to bring innovative products or services to the marketplace.
The Retail Services segment competes for consumers and franchisees with other major franchised brands that offer a turn-key operations management system, such as Jiffy Lube, Grease Monkey, Take 5 Oil Change, Express Oil Change, and Mr. Lube in Canada. Retail Services competes for consumers and Express Care operators with national branded companies that offer a professional signage program with limited business model support, similar to Valvoline’s Express Care™ network. Regional players that are not directly affiliated with a major brand and automotive dealerships and service centers, which provide quick lube and other preventive maintenance services, are also competitors for Retail Services consumers. Valvoline believes there are more than 10,000 quick lube stores operating within the U.S. and Canada market, which is highly fragmented and primarily comprised of independent operators that operate a small number of locations and a small number of larger brands that comprise a significant portion of the overall market. Valvoline has the second and third largest chain in the U.S. and Canada, respectively, by number of stores.
In the Global Products segment, Valvoline’s principal competitors for DIY automotive parts retailers are global integrated oil brands, such as Shell, which produces Pennzoil and Quaker State; BP, which produces Castrol; Exxon Mobil, which produces Mobil 1; as well as mid-tier brands and private label producers. Valvoline currently ranks as the number three passenger car motor oil brand in the U.S. DIY market by volume. With respect to installer customers, major competitors vary by region. Valvoline competes with these same major global integrated oil brands that have a strong presence in North America, Europe, and Asia. In certain international markets, Valvoline also competes with regional brands, including brands produced by national oil companies, such as Sinopec in China and Indian Oil in India.
Marketing and sales
Valvoline places a high priority on sales and marketing and focuses marketing efforts on areas expected to yield the highest rate of return. Valvoline has a centralized marketing services group as well as dedicated marketing resources in both reportable segments to reach target customers. Valvoline uses a variety of marketing techniques to build awareness of, and create demand for, Valvoline products and services. Valvoline advertises through social and digital media, as well as traditional media outlets such as radio. Valvoline selectively sponsors teams in high performance racing, including a current National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing ("NASCAR") sponsorship of Hendrick Motorsports, featuring the 2021 NASCAR Cup Series champion, Kyle Larson, and drivers, Chase Elliott, William Byron and Alex Bowman. In addition, Valvoline sponsors other teams and players, including 2020 Europa League champion, Sevilla Fútbol Club, which plays in La Liga and the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball. 
Trained Retail Services technicians utilize Valvoline's proprietary SuperProTM system to share what services customers need based on their vehicle service history and OEM recommendations to drive customer loyalty and trust. The Company's strengths in digital marketing and data analytics are leveraged to attract new customers and retain current ones, including tailored marketing campaigns targeted at specific customers when they are expected to need service.
The majority of Valvoline’s large customers are supported by direct sales representatives with a number of key customers having dedicated Valvoline teams. Valvoline’s solutions are available for every engine and powertrain and are offered at more than 80,000 locations worldwide, including approximately 1,600 service center stores and nearly 300 independent Express Care™ locations. Valvoline serves its customer base through its sales force and technical support organization, leveraging the Company’s technology portfolio and customer relationships globally, while meeting customer demands locally. Valvoline also utilizes its digital infrastructure and technology to more 
efficiently interact with customers, driving customer engagement to deliver growth, customer retention and acquisition. 
Research and development
Valvoline's research and development focuses on new, unique, and innovative products and services to meet current and future customer needs. These products and services are discovered using Valvoline’s unique “Hands on Expertise” innovation approach, which promotes a deep insight of customer requirements, resulting in a high innovation success rate. Novel ideas are vetted using mathematical modeling from first principles when applicable, and the technology team works with the business through commercialization to ensure a positive customer experience. Regional technology centers in the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific regions also locally develop appropriate solutions for vehicle and equipment maintenance and manufacturing in their markets. In addition to its own research and development initiatives, Valvoline also conducts testing for other entities, which partially offsets its research and development costs by increasing asset utilization. Valvoline will continue funding research and development to continue deploying innovative, high-quality products and services, which enhances Valvoline’s competitive position.
Intellectual property
Valvoline is continually seeking to develop new technology and enhance its existing technology. Valvoline has been issued approximately 60 U.S. and 90 international patents and has nearly 20 U.S. and 50 international patent applications pending or published. Valvoline's patent portfolio evolves as new patents are awarded and as older patents expire. These patents expire at various dates up to 15 years or more from their original filing dates.
Valvoline holds over 2,500 trademarks in over 140 countries across the world, including the Valvoline and “V” brand logo trademarks. These trademarks have a perpetual life, are generally subject to renewal every ten years, and are among Valvoline's most protected and valuable assets. Valvoline owns approximately 900 domain names that are used to promote Valvoline services and products and provide information about the Company.
Valvoline uses various trade names and service marks in its business and for key products, including ValvolineTM and Valvoline Instant Oil ChangeSM, among others. Valvoline also has a variety of intellectual property licensing agreements that vary in scope and duration, including those that cross-license and provide access to other intellectual property and license intellectual property to others in return for revenues. 
Raw material supply and prices
The key raw materials used in Valvoline’s business are base oils, additives, packaging materials (high density polyethylene bottles, corrugated packaging and steel drums) and ethylene glycol. Valvoline continuously monitors global supply and cost trends of these key raw materials and obtains these raw materials from a diversified network of large global suppliers and regional providers. Valvoline’s sourcing strategy is to ensure supply through contracting with a diversified supply base while leveraging market conditions to take advantage of spot opportunities whenever such conditions are available. Valvoline leverages worldwide spend to pursue favorable contract terms from global suppliers and utilizes regional providers to ensure market competitiveness and reliability in its supply chain. Valvoline also utilizes the Company’s research and development resources to develop alternative product formulations, which provide flexibility in the event of supply interruptions. Valvoline closely monitors the Company’s supply chain and conducts periodic supply risk assessments of its critical suppliers to reduce risk.
Valvoline has a large manufacturing and distribution footprint in the United States, with seven lubricant blending and packaging plants and several packaging and warehouse locations. Additional blending and packaging plants are located in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, Serbia and China. The blending and packaging plant in China began production in fiscal 2021 and is currently producing most of the Company's lubricant volume for the China market. Valvoline also uses numerous third-party toll manufacturers and warehouses both in the U.S. and internationally and is part of joint ventures that operate blending and packaging facilities in Ecuador and India.
Valvoline seeks to actively manage fluctuations in supply costs, product selling prices and the timing thereof to preserve margins. The prices of many of Valvoline’s products fluctuate based on the price of base oil, which represents a large percentage of Valvoline’s cost of sales. Given that base oil, a derivative of crude, is highly correlated to the global oil market, there can be variability in base oil prices related to the world crude price as well 
as the global supply and demand balance of base oil. Base oil prices generally follow crude prices, but the lag period between changes in the price of crude oil and changes in the price of base oil is influenced by whether there is an excess of or shortness in the supply of base oil. As part of the strategy to mitigate the impact of base oil price variability, Valvoline seeks to negotiate supply contracts with terms that minimize the impact of changes in the base oil market on Valvoline’s financial results. 
Valvoline works diligently to adjust product selling prices to react to changes in base oil costs and to preserve its margins. The customer value proposition in Retail Services focuses on convenience and quality service which provides the ability to leverage pricing power to raise prices while maintaining customer loyalty. The Company's contracts in several of its sales channels establish the timing of adjustments to selling prices in response to changes in raw material prices. Pricing adjustments to products sold to Valvoline’s larger installer customers, including Valvoline's franchisees, are made pursuant to their contracts and are generally based on movements in published base oil indices. Pricing adjustments for product sold to automotive parts retailers and smaller installer customers, in addition to private label products in the United States, are generally market-driven and based on negotiations in light of base oil costs and the pricing strategies of Valvoline’s competitors. 
Seasonality
Overall, there is little seasonality in Valvoline’s business. Valvoline’s services, and to a lesser extent its product sales in North America, experience slightly higher volumes in the summer months and during the periods of time leading into holidays due to increased miles driven from vacation and holiday travel. Sales within North America can also slow modestly from October to February due to inclement weather. Outside of North America, Valvoline experiences little seasonality due to geographic diversity and the high proportion of commercial and industrial product sales that are less influenced by weather.
Environmental and regulatory matters
Valvoline is subject to numerous federal, state, local and non-U.S. environmental health and safety (“EHS”) laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern matters such as safe working conditions; product stewardship; air emissions; discharges to the land and surface waters; generation, handling, storage, transportation, recycling, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials; and the registration and evaluation of chemicals. Valvoline maintains policies and procedures to control EHS risks and monitor compliance with applicable EHS laws and regulations. These laws and regulations also require Valvoline to obtain and comply with permits, registrations or other authorizations issued by governmental authorities. These authorities can modify or revoke the Company’s permits, registrations or other authorizations and can enforce compliance through fines and injunctions. Valvoline expects to incur ongoing costs to comply with existing and future EHS requirements, including the cost of dedicated EHS resources who are responsible for ensuring its business maintains compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
The Company is also subject to regulation by various U.S. federal regulatory agencies and by the applicable regulatory authorities in countries in which Valvoline’s products are manufactured and sold. Such regulations principally relate to the ingredients, classification, labeling, manufacturing, packaging, transportation, advertising and marketing of Valvoline’s products. Additionally, as a U.S. entity operating through subsidiaries in non-U.S. jurisdictions, the Company is subject to foreign exchange control, transfer pricing and customs laws that regulate the import and export of goods as well as the flow of funds between Valvoline and its subsidiaries. The Company is also required to be in compliance with transfer pricing, securities laws and other statutes and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and other countries’ anti-corruption and anti-bribery regimes.
In addition, Valvoline is subject to laws relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments and consumer credit, protection and fraud. An increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information, including financial information (e.g., credit card numbers), social security numbers, and health information. The Company is also subject to labor and employment laws, including regulations established by the U.S. Department of Labor and other local regulatory agencies, which sets laws governing working conditions, paid leave, workplace safety, wage and hour standards, and hiring and employment practices.
Valvoline understands the significant impact it can have on the environment. Through greenhouse initiatives such as striving to reduce the Company's carbon emissions and supporting and servicing environmentally friendly 
alternatives such as hybrid and electric vehicles, Valvoline is committed to operating in a manner that supports sustainability. Valvoline's global corporate carbon reduction strategy focuses on avoiding carbon emissions, reducing emissions within its own operations, and then looking to mitigate the remaining emissions. This strategy is implemented by seeking out opportunities through operational efficiencies, product development, additive power purchase agreements ("PPA"), and renewable energy credits ("REC"). The Company surpassed its goal to reduce its operation's carbon emissions by five percent over five years from a 2016 baseline by achieving this target in 2020. Valvoline's near term carbon initiatives include expanding its REC purchases, executing a PPA, and targeting carbon reductions at sites identified with high carbon emitting electric sources. Based upon these efforts and strategies, Valvoline is well positioned to further reduce carbon emission. Valvoline will continue to build on this progress and develop longer term goals. With 2020 as the new baseline, a short-term goal has been established for a ten percent reduction in carbon intensity of Valvoline's global plants and warehouses by fiscal year 2022.
While there are no current environmental or regulatory matters that Valvoline expects to be material to its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows, there can be no assurances that existing or future environmental laws or other regulations applicable to the Company’s operations or products will not lead to a material adverse impact on Valvoline’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Human capital 
"It all starts with our people" is one of Valvoline's core values, and the Company endeavors to create an environment that promotes safety, fosters diversity, encourages creativity, rewards performance, and challenges each employee. In order to recruit and retain the most qualified team members in the industry, Valvoline focuses on treating team members well by paying competitive wages, offering attractive benefit packages and robust training and development opportunities, in addition to providing a strong operational support infrastructure with opportunities for upward mobility. Valvoline is committed to actively creating an environment where each team member is empowered to learn, grow, and maximize their personal contribution. 
Valvoline conducts business in more than 140 countries and territories, and employees operate across cultures, functions and languages to solve the technical and logistical challenges created by a worldwide customer base. The table below provides the Company's approximate global distribution of employees worldwide (excluding contract employees) as of September 30, 2021:

Region | Number of employees
North America | 8,800 
Asia Pacific | 685 
Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") | 285 
Latin America | 30 
Total | 9,800 

Valvoline routinely surveys team members to focus on continuous improvement and track employee engagement levels. The Company’s recent company-wide survey results included a total employee engagement score that exceeded third party benchmark targets. Drivers of employee engagement include culture and work environment, leadership trust, management support, meaningful work, and opportunities to grow, and Valvoline scored above the benchmark score in all five of these dimensions as well. In response to feedback gathered in its employee engagement survey, a cross-functional team is developing additional resources and communications to increase the visibility and clarity of development and growth opportunities for employees. Valvoline believes the employee engagement survey results are meaningful from a recruitment and overall business perspective as employee recommendations and satisfaction are important to recruit top talent. The Company also believes satisfied employees are more productive, are more likely to have a positive impact on employees around them, and are more likely to deliver great customer service.
There are several ways in which Valvoline seeks to attract, develop, and retain highly qualified talent as summarized further below.
Talent acquisition
Valvoline fosters a workplace culture that attracts and retains top, diverse talent at every level. Valvoline's talent acquisition is based on qualifications and experiences of target employees, including "building block" traits and capabilities that support strong development early in an employee's career with the Company. Valvoline utilizes innovative technology and structured processes intended to attract qualified candidates, including engaging job descriptions designed to reach a larger audience, a quick and mobile-friendly application process, online chat features to proactively address applicant questions, and video storytelling that offers a view of Valvoline's culture through the lens of its own employees. These tools have been created to convey what makes Valvoline unique as an employer to better attract diverse and ideal candidates, and these strong branding and sourcing efforts allow Valvoline to select among the very best. 
In addition to needs across Valvoline's business, the Company’s focus on aggressively growing the Retail Services system that included the addition of 132 net new system-wide stores in fiscal 2021, creates a critical need for talent to operate those stores. Valvoline utilizes its tools and processes to attract qualified candidates within its Retail Services system, including providing support to franchise sourcing efforts. Franchisees are able to take advantage of Valvoline's recruiting and marketing programs, in addition to sharing hiring experiences and best practices across the system to ensure company-operated and franchised locations attract and hire the best candidates to deliver consistent and superior service to Valvoline's customers. 
Valvoline is committed to delivering an original experience for its candidates and was named a 2021 Talent Board Candidate Experience ("CandE") Award Winner in North America for the third consecutive year. The CandE Awards recognize companies with the highest positive candidate ratings in Talent Board's comprehensive benchmark research. Valvoline ranked 16th overall and third in the services industry. 
Training and development
The opportunity to develop and advance, regardless of job role or geographical location is critical to the success of Valvoline as a global organization, and a key component of Valvoline's talent development approach is to provide each team member with the necessary tools and training opportunities to develop “Hands-On Expertise” within their area of subject matter knowledge. Valvoline offers voluntary and compulsory regulatory and compliance training programs across the organization based on job role and function. Formal education opportunities are delivered via virtual or in-person classes and e-learning. Topics range from safety, compliance, customer service, sales and product training, as well as management and leadership skills and professional effectiveness. Valvoline also offers approximately 20 hours of live training and development for its new managers and has many partnerships to deliver quality development opportunities, including those with leading universities, research organizations, companies, and industry and professional organizations. In addition, employees may attend seminars and training programs provided by industry trade and professional organizations. Valvoline also provides tuition assistance for employees enrolled in higher education programs directed at improving their performance or helping them prepare for a future role within the Company.
Within the Valvoline Instant Oil ChangeSM system of company-operated and franchised service center stores, employees are provided regular training. New employees receive 270 hours of training that is generally completed within the first 60 days of employment leading to their first certification and another 225 hours of training in the next 140 days that leads to a promotion. This structured early learning follows the detailed training plan of SuperProTM, an internal management system for executing Valvoline's retail services, which is supported by a proprietary digital learning platform. Employees are trained, tested and certified on these standards as they support and encourage the proper and safe use of personal protective equipment, tools and system practices to drive superior engagement, performance and customer service. Each day may include manager-led training, hands-on learning activities, checklists, virtual learning, and certifications, all of which provide employees with a solid foundation for long-term careers with Valvoline. By engaging team members early, Valvoline provides them with the necessary tools to learn and acquire new skills which increases their value as an employee and, most importantly, affords them the opportunity to advance their careers.
Valvoline Instant Oil ChangeSM also provides an Introduction to Management program that occurs multiple times during the year where assistant managers who qualify as potential store managers meet for three days to interact with leadership team members and peers from other stores to learn about Valvoline's culture, share best practices, and receive management training to prepare them for career advancement. The combination of these efforts enable 
Valvoline to continue a promote-from-within strategy which has led to 100% of service center managers, area managers, and market manager promotions in the last year being earned by team members who started in hourly positions at Valvoline Instant Oil ChangeSM.
Valvoline received 2021 BEST Award winner recognition from the Association for Talent Development. The BEST Award recognizes organizations that are Building talent, Enterprise-wide and Strategically driving a Talent development culture that delivers results. Valvoline placed 7th globally in 2021, which is its fourth top ten finish in the last five years. 
Total Rewards
Valvoline believes that happy and well-cared-for team members bring their best selves to work. The Company provides a wide variety of benefits to eligible full-time and part-time employees. These benefits help support Valvoline’s strategy to provide competitive programs in each country, aligning to the changing business environment and meeting employee needs. This includes attraction, retention, inclusion, motivation, development, promotion, engagement, and well-being (mental, financial, and personal health). 
The Company’s benefits offered to its employees in most of the countries where Valvoline does business consist of defined contribution matching, tuition reimbursement, and paid time off, including holiday pay, paid family leave and other leave programs. Valvoline’s benefits also include progressive and affordable healthcare plans and life, disability, and accident insurance coverage. In addition, the Company provides a variety of physical, financial, and mental health resources to support taking care of the whole employee.
Health and safety
One of Valvoline's top priorities is protecting the health and safety of its team members, known as its "Vamily." Valvoline offers employer-sponsored health and wellness benefits to all of its full-time U.S. employees and their families. Valvoline also provides market competitive benefits in all countries in which the Company operates. In addition, Valvoline strives to create workplaces and practices in all environments that team members work in to help foster a safe and secure environment for every employee and customer. Valvoline emphasizes that "safety is always our priority" through one of its core values.
During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, Valvoline formed a COVID-19 Steering Team that has been leading and coordinating the Company's overall response. This team leads efforts to develop and monitor mitigation and business continuity plans; track all relevant country, state and local government guidelines, directives and regulations; develop and adopt flexible work-from-home options for non-production and non-store team members; maintain safe working protocols for production and service center store teams; assess and implement appropriate return-to-office protocols; and provide timely and transparent communications to global employees and key stakeholders. One of the guiding principles this team continues to rely upon in forming its decisions is protecting the safety and well-being of Valvoline's global teams. Valvoline provided benefits to its employees to cover the cost of COVID-19 testing, offered on and off-site COVID-19 vaccinations and flu shots, promoted its telehealth benefits, expanded its employee assistance and well-being plans, implemented a new remote work policy, and offered individual paid time off and family leave, including paid sick or pandemic leave for quarantined employees. 
Diversity and inclusion
The Company believes in an inclusive workforce, where diverse backgrounds are represented, engaged and empowered to inspire innovative ideas and decisions. Valvoline does business in more than 140 countries and territories, and its employees operate across cultures, functions, language barriers and time zones to solve the technical and logistical challenges presented by its worldwide customer base. Valvoline is focused on (1) promoting a culture of diversity and inclusion that leverages the talents of all employees, (2) implementing practices that attract, recruit and retain diverse top talent, and (3) demonstrating an investment in diversity and inclusion through diverse supplier spend, depositing cash in federally-insured minority depository institutions ("MDIs") and through the Company's charitable giving. Valvoline supports employee-led networking groups that are open to all employees and provide a forum to communicate and exchange ideas, build a network of relationships across the Company, and pursue personal and professional development, such as Valvoline Women’s International Network. The Company also actively sponsors events that promote diversity and utilizes its Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council, a working committee to help steer diversity and inclusion efforts across the business and its operations. As 
part of the Company's commitment to deposit cash in MDIs, Valvoline has invested approximately $2 million of its cash equivalents as of September 30, 2021 with MDIs and is actively working to identify additional MDIs to invest with on an ongoing basis. 
Citizenship
Valvoline’s citizenship efforts extend across the globe and support social and educational needs. At various times throughout the year, Valvoline supports its employees in volunteering their time and talents to give back to their communities. Valvoline employees support the United Way, Red Cross, Children’s Miracle Network, Habitat for Humanity, Big Brothers Big Sisters, Building Homes for Heroes, and many more local and global institutions and organizations. 
Valvoline's Charitable Giving Program encourages its team members to support the communities in which they live and in which the Company operates, through hands-on service, focused generosity and the continuous pursuit of innovative and sustainable solutions. Yearly, a major focus of Valvoline’s charitable giving programs is the annual employee giving campaign where employees are encouraged to give monthly donations through payroll deduction to the charity of their choice. Valvoline’s matching program will match the donations given to the organizations that align with the Company’s giving pillars: (1) disadvantaged families and children, (2) education, (3) the environment, and/or (4) diversity and inclusion. Additionally, Valvoline’s Grant Program offers non-profits the opportunity to submit proposals once a year for specific needs within their organization. Valvoline’s Charitable Giving Committee awards the grants based on the Company’s giving pillars.
