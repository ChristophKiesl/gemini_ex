ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Overview
 
Future FinTech is a holding company incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida. The Company historically engaged in the production and sale of fruit juice concentrates (including fruit purees and fruit juices), fruit beverages (including fruit juice beverages and fruit cider beverages) in the PRC. Due to drastically increased production costs and tightened environmental laws in China, the Company had transformed its business from fruit juice manufacturing and distribution to a real-name blockchain based e-commerce platform that integrates blockchain and internet technology. The main business of the Company includes an online shopping platform, Chain Cloud Mall (“CCM”), which is based on blockchain technology; a cross-border e-commerce platform (“NONOGIRL”); a blockchain-based application incubator; and technical service and support for real name and blockchain based assets and their operating entities; and the application and development of blockchain-based e-commerce technology and financial technology. The Company is also expanding into financial services.
 
Chain Cloud Mall adopts a “multi-vendor hosted stores + platform self-hosted stores” model. The platform supports various marketing methods, including point rewards programs, coupons, live webcasts, game interaction, and social media sharing. Besides the blockchain-powered features, CCM is also fully equipped with the same functions and services that other Chinese leading traditional e-commerce platforms provide.
 
Based on blockchain technology, CCM is established to transform the relationship between companies and consumers from traditional selling and buying relationships to a value-sharing relationship. The platform will fairly distribute the benefit of the entire mall to users who engaged in the promotion, development, and consumption based on their contributions to the platform. The members of CCM are not only consumers and entrepreneurs but also participants, promoters and beneficiaries. The CCM shared shopping mall platform is designed to be a block-chain based shopping mall for merchants and goods, not the exchange of digital currencies, and it currently only accepts payment from credit cards, Alipay and WeChat.
 
Chain Cloud Mall is an enterprise and customer interactive and comprehensive shopping and sales service platform. It is an open network promotion system with a blockchain based anti-counterfeit system including referral point and discount points issuance and settlement. The new business model creates a completely new source of data traffic for enterprises on our platform.
 
Merchants on the Chain Cloud Mall issue their own blockchain points and anti-counterfeiting QR codes. Every product comes with unique anti-counterfeiting QR codes on the label. Customers collect the points issued by the merchants by scanning products with their mobile phones on the anti-counterfeiting QR code. These QR codes are generated by blockchain system of Chain Cloud Mall and provided to merchants. The successful collection of the merchant points confirms that the authentication of product from such enterprise. The Chain Cloud Mall records and provides Chain Cloud Mall points to its members upon a successful new member and/or product referral, which can be used as credit when making purchases on CCM. It incentivizes its members to promote the platform and share the products with their social contacts, which in turn increases the sales through Chain Cloud Mall and helps the Company generate greater value.
 
NONOGIRL started its trial operation in March 2020 and formally launched in July 2020. It is a cross-border e-commerce platform, which aims to build a new s2b2c (supplier to business and consumer) outsourcing sales platform dominated by social media influencers. It is aimed at the growing female consumer market, with the ability to broadcast, short video, and all forms communication through the platform. It can also create a sale oriented sharing ecosystem with other major social media used by customers, etc.
 
The Company currently has three direct wholly-owned subsidiaries: DigiPay FinTech Limited (“DigiPay”), a company incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands, Future FinTech (Hong Kong) Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of Hong Kong, and GlobalKey Shared Mall Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of Cayman Islands (“GlobalKey Shared Mall”).

Impact of COVID-19 on our Business
 
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, the pandemic quickly spread to many provinces, autonomous regions, and cities all over the China and other parts of the world. COVID-19 has materially and adversely affected our business, especially during the first six months of 2020. In early 2020, Chinese government took emergency measures to combat the spread of the virus, including quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of office buildings and facilities in China.
 
Substantially all of our revenues are generated in China. In response to the evolving dynamics related to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Company is following the guidelines of local authorities as it prioritizes the health and safety of its employees, contractors, suppliers and business partners. Our offices in China was closed and all of the Company’s employees worked from home from Chinese New Year at the end of January 2020 until late March 2020. Other businesses in China started reopening around the end of the first quarter as well, and more and more businesses, transportation, logistic and marketing activities have gradually resumed since then. Our offices currently are in normal operation. However, quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of office buildings have negatively impacted our business during the outbreak. Our suppliers have negatively been affected, and could continue to be negatively affected in their ability to supply and ship products to our customers by any further outbreak or resurgence of COVID-19 in China. Our customers that are negatively impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19 may reduce their budgets to purchase products and services from us, which may materially adversely impact our revenue. The business operations of the third parties’ stores on our platform have been and could continue to be negatively impacted by any further outbreak or resurgence of COVID-19, which may negatively impact their operations and business, which may in turn adversely affect the business of our platform as a whole as well as our financial condition and operating results. The outbreak has had and might continue to have disruption to our supply chain, logistics providers, or customers if there is a resurgence of COVID-19 in China, which could materially adversely impact our business and results of operations, including causing our suppliers to cease manufacturing products for a period of time or materially delay delivery to us and customers, which may also lead to loss of customers, as well as reputational, competitive and business harm to us. The Company’s promotion strategy for our e-commerce platforms mainly relied on the training of members and distributors through meetings and conferences. Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the Chinese government put a restriction on large gatherings and these restrictions made the promotion strategy for CCM Shopping Mall and NONOGIRL difficult to implement, which have caused the decrease in the sales and enrollment of new members. Some of our customers, contractors, suppliers and other business partners are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which may not have strong cash flows or be well capitalized, and may be vulnerable to an epidemic outbreak and slowing macroeconomic conditions. If the SMEs that we work with cannot weather the COVID-19 and the resulting economic impact, or cannot resume business as usual after a prolonged outbreak, our revenues and business operations may be materially and adversely impacted.
 
The global economy has also been materially negatively affected by the COVID-19 and there is continued uncertainty about the duration and intensity of its impacts. The Chinese and global growth forecast is extremely uncertain, which would seriously affect customer spending in our shopping mall.
 
While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, a widespread pandemic may result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of the Company’s Common Stock.
 
Further, as we do not have access to a revolving credit facility, there can be no assurance that we would be able to secure commercial debt financing in the future in the event that we require additional capital. We currently believe that our financial resources will be adequate to see us through the outbreak. However, in the event that we do need to raise capital in the future, outbreak-related instability in the securities markets could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital.
 
Consequently, our results of operations have been materially adversely affected. Any future impact to our results will depend on, to a large extent, future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the duration and severity of the COVID-19 and the actions taken by government authorities and other entities to contain the COVID-19 or treat its impact, almost all of which are beyond our control.

On June 1, 2019, CCM v2.0 was launched. Compared to the 1.0 version, CCM v2.0 has a wider variety of product categories, easier user interface, more transparent information, more stable operations, a higher security level, and faster logistics.
 
On May 1, 2020, CCM v3.0 was launched. The latest CCM v3.0 creates a new value cycle system of online shopping mall with the real-name blockchain system with following characteristics:
 

1. | Blockchain anti-counterfeiting 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Blockchain points settlement leads to secondary data traffic
3. | Points promotion system 
4. | Member community system to build a high value community 

 
The blockchain technology enables CCM to record every event or transaction on a distributed ledger and makes the whole process traceable. It also enables the CCM to record and provide CCM points to its members upon a successful new member and/or product referral, which can be used as credit when making purchases on CCM. It incentivizes its members to promote the platform and share the products with their social contacts, which in turn increases the sales through CCM.
 
Based on blockchain technology, CCM is established to transform the relationship between companies and consumers from a traditional selling and buying relationship to a value-sharing relationship. The platform fairly distributes the benefits of the entire mall to users who engage in promotion, development, and consumption based on their contributions to the platform. The members of CCM are not only consumers and entrepreneurs but also participants, promoters and beneficiaries.
 
CCM has attracted a growing base of users, including members and non-members. These users are actively purchasing products on the platform. Members are the key participants on CCM and drivers of its growth. Our members typically pay to gain access to a dedicated app that provides access to a curated selection of products, exclusive membership benefits, and features, including discounted prices and point rewards. Members can refer others to become members and are rewarded for doing so. Members can also promote products on various social platforms and are rewarded if those users purchase our products.
 
Currently, there are three kinds of membership programs with different membership Fees. The members are required to log onto CCM app or web portal in order to download some of their rewarding points each day. The member could download all his/her rewarding points if he/she logs onto the app or web portal for at least 200 days within the membership valid period which is 365 days. Members must renew their membership before expiration to continue earning points and enjoy the discounts. A non-member user can purchase products from the platform but does not enjoy the above-mentioned benefits.
 
Membership benefits are as follows:
 

1) | Receive a merchandise gift package 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | Exclusive discounts for merchandise sold on the CCM Web and App 
3) | Receive CCM-Points upon a successful new member and product referral

 
CCM-Points can be used as coupons for the member’s future purchases on our app and website.
 
CCM had approximately 6,687 and 6,401 users as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
 
We currently generate revenues primarily from fixed membership fees and selling products on our platform to users, including both members and non-members. Membership revenue is recognized when a member registers and makes his/her first order on CCM app or web portal.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately $0.34 million was recognized for fixed membership fees revenue from 5,362 members and approximately $9,159 for merchandise sales revenue from orders on the Company’s own sales platform, which in total account for 2.47% of our total revenue. 
 
Competition and our Competitive Advantages
 
The e-commerce industry in China is intensely competitive. Our competitors include all major e-commerce companies in China, and other internet companies that engage in social e-commerce businesses.
 
We anticipate that the e-commerce industry will continually evolve and will continue to experience rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, shifting customer requirements, and frequent innovation. We must continually innovate to remain competitive.
 
We compete primarily on the basis of the following factors: (i) our ability to attract and retain a large number of members and other users and establish strong community bonding and maintain member loyalty through interaction effectively and reward programs; (ii) our shared shopping platform that enables users to buy products easily; (iii) strong fulfillment capabilities, including logistics and online payment, (iv) advanced technology infrastructure, and (v) reliable and flexible supply chain and strong manufacturing partner network. 
 
We have a unique real-name and membership–based blockchain e-commerce shopping platform that integrates blockchain, internet technology and distinguishes itself by utilizing the automatic value distribution system of the blockchain and sharing the value of the platform to all the participants in the system. In addition to providing value and convenience to our members, we reward them for referring new members and promoting our products and helping to generate transactions. Based on blockchain technology, CCM is established to transform the relationship between companies and consumers from traditional selling and buying relationship to a value-sharing relationship. The platform will fairly distribute the benefit of the entire mall to users who engage in promotion, development, and consumption based on their contributions to the platform.
 
Our latest CCM v3.0 creates a new value cycle system of online shopping mall with the real-name blockchain system with following characteristics:
 

1. | Blockchain anti-counterfeiting
---+-------------------------------

 
Using real-name blockchain technology to carry out anti-counterfeiting for products produced by the enterprises. The essence of anti-counterfeiting is to determine the person responsible for the product. Using real-name blockchain system, it provides the assurance to our customers to the authentication of the products they purchase and solve the problem of counterfeiting products in online shopping mall.
 

2. | Blockchain points settlement leads to secondary data traffic
---+-------------------------------------------------------------

 
Blockchain points are also discount coupons for merchants, guiding customers to the platform of the merchants, and provide them discounts when purchasing. This process is called secondary data traffic. It is important to maintain old customers. Blockchain anti-counterfeiting technology through scanning of QR codes by the customers helps companies identify such customers and allows them to systematically maintain contacts with such customers.
 

3. | Points promotion system
---+------------------------

 
Points promotion system brings secondary data traffic comes with volume and high turnover ratio. All such sales are directed to the merchants’ stores when customers possess and use merchants’ coupons. With a high level of user stickiness, customers are likely to purchase products again and collect more blockchain points.
 

4. | Member community system to build a high value community
---+--------------------------------------------------------

 
Anti-counterfeiting technology plus the Company’s secondary data traffic platform have created great value for the merchants that have stores on our platform. By gathering all loyal customers to a merchant’s store, it can build a community of people with the common interest. Through the community, the merchant can form a self-organizing system with customer groups to maximize the interests of such merchant.
 
We believe that our management team, which includes Yongke Xue, our Chairman of Board of Directors, Shanchun Huang, Chief Executive Officer, Ming Yi, our Chief Financial Officer, Yang Liu, our Chief Operation Officer and Weicheng Pan, our Chief Strategy Officer, and a seasoned team of senior managers with significant experience in the areas of operations, marketing, technology and finance.

2020 is a year of China-ASEAN digital economic cooperation. Leading high-quality development with a credible digital economy is becoming a new highlight in the development of cooperation between China and ASEAN countries. In the field of digital economy, China and ASEAN countries have a good foundation and environment of cooperation. We believe it is a good time to create application demonstration projects through the construction of digital infrastructure, support for 5G networks, the advancement of artificial intelligence, the initiation of innovative applications of blockchain and other emerging technologies. 
 
At present, ASEAN countries hope to keep up with the development of the digital economy in order to start the digitalization of border markets, e-commerce, cross-border settlement, smart logistics, supply chain finance and traditional industries as soon as possible. As a basic and systematic technology and facility, the application of blockchain is expected to become an important force for future industrial revolution.

Government Regulations
 
Regulations Relating to E-Commerce

In January 2014, the former State of Administration of Industry and Commerce (which has been merged into State Administration for Market Regulation or SAMR) adopted the Administrative Measures for Online Trading, or the Online Trading Measures, which took effect in March 2014. Under the Online Trading Measures, e-commerce platform operators are required to examine, register and archive the identity information of the merchants applying for access to their platforms as sellers, and verify and update such information regularly. The Online Trading Measures also provide that e-commerce platform operators must make publicly available (i) the link to or the information contained in the business licenses of the merchants, in the case of business entities, or (ii) a label confirming the verified identity of the merchants, in the case of individuals. A consumer is entitled to return the commodities within seven days after receipt of the commodities without giving a reason, except for the following commodities: customized commodities, fresh and perishable commodities, audio-visual products downloaded online or unpackaged by consumers and computer software and other digital commodities, and newspapers and journals that have been delivered. E-commerce platform operators must, within seven days upon receipt of the returned commodities, provide full refunds to consumers. In addition, operators are prohibited from setting forth provisions in contracts or other terms that are not fair or reasonable to consumers such as those excluding or restraining consumers’ rights, relieving or exempting operators’ responsibilities, and increasing the consumers’ responsibilities, or conducting transactions in a forcible manner taking advantage of contractual terms or technical means.

In March 2016, the State Administration of Taxation, or the SAT, the Ministry of Finance, or the MOF, and the General Administration of Customs jointly issued the Circular on Tax Policy for Cross-Border E-Commerce Retail Imports, which took effect in April 2016. Pursuant to this circular, goods imported through the cross-border e-commerce retail are subject to tariff, import value-added tax, and consumption tax based on the types of goods. Individuals purchasing any goods imported through cross-border e-commerce retail are taxpayers, and e-commerce companies, companies operating e-commerce transaction platforms or logistic companies are required to withhold the taxes.
 
On August 31, 2018, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress promulgated the E-Commerce Law, which became effective on January 1, 2019. The E-Commerce Law sets forth a series of requirements on e-commerce platform operators. According to the E-Commerce Law, e-commerce platform operators shall verify and register platform merchants, and cooperate with the market regulatory administrative department and tax administrative department to conduct industry and commerce registrations and tax registrations for merchants. The e-commerce platform operators shall also prepare a contingency plan for cybersecurity events and take technological measures and other measures to prevent online illegal and criminal activities. The E-Commerce Law also expressly requires platform operators to take necessary actions to ensure fair dealing on their platforms to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of consumers, including to prepare platform service agreements and transaction information record-keeping and transaction rules, to prominently display such documents on the platform’s website, and to keep such information for no fewer than three years following the completion of a transaction. To legally handle intellectual property infringement disputes, upon receipt of the notice specifying preliminary evidence for alleged infringement, the platform operators are required to take necessary measures in a timely manner, such as deleting, blocking and disconnecting the hyperlinks, terminating transactions and services, and forwarding notices to merchants on its platform. If an e-commerce platform operator fails to take necessary measures when it knows or should have known that a merchant on the platform infringes any third-party intellectual property rights, products or services provided by a merchant on its platform do not meet the requirements regarding personal or property safety, or any merchant otherwise impairs the lawful rights and interests of consumers, the e-commerce platform operator will be held jointly liable with the merchants on its platform.
 
Moreover, the E-Commerce Law imposes a requirement on operators of e-commerce platforms to assist in tax collection with respect to income generated by sellers from transactions conducted on e-commerce platforms, including among others, submitting to the tax authority information on the identities of sellers on e-commerce platforms and other information relating to tax payment. Failure to comply with the requirement may result in operators of e-commerce platform being subject to fines and, in severe circumstances, suspension of business operations of e-commerce platforms. If the merchants on our platform were deemed to be selling our products on consignment basis, the PRC tax authorities may require our members to make tax registration and request our assistance in these efforts, pursuant to the new E-Commerce Law, and the merchants may be subject to more stringent tax compliance requirements. See “Risk Factors— Failure to comply with the relatively new E-Commerce Law may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.” According to the EIT Law, the VAT Law and other applicable regulations, sellers that conduct transactions on e-commerce platforms are generally subject to enterprise income tax at a rate of 25%, and value-added tax at a rate of 13% or 9% for services or products sold on the e-commerce platforms. Certain sellers that are deemed as small taxpayers under PRC law are subject to reduced value-added tax at a rate of 3%.
 
Value-Added Telecommunication Business Operating Licenses
 
The PRC Telecommunications Regulations, or the Telecom Regulations, which were issued by the State Council in 2000 and were most recently amended in February 2016 are the primary governing law on telecommunication services. The Telecom Regulations set out the general framework for the provision of telecommunication services by PRC entities. Under the Telecom Regulations, telecommunications service providers are required to procure operating licenses prior to their commencement of operations. The Telecom Regulations draw a distinction between “basic telecommunications services” and “value-added telecommunications services.” A “Catalog of Telecommunications Business” was issued as an attachment to the Telecom Regulations to categorize telecommunications services as basic or value-added. In December 2015, MIIT released the Catalog of Telecommunication Business (2015 Revision), or the 2015 Telecom Catalog, implemented in March 2016. Under the 2015 Telecom Catalog, both the online data processing and transaction processing business (i.e., operating e-commerce business) and information service business, continue to be categorized as value-added telecommunication services.

In March 2009, MIIT issued the Administrative Measures for Telecommunications Business Operating Permit, or the Telecom Permit Measures, which was implemented in 2009 and most recently amended in 2017. Pursuant to the Telecom Permit Measures, the operation scope of the value-added telecommunication business operating license, or VATS license, shall detail the permitted activities of the enterprise to which it is granted. An approved telecommunication services operator shall conduct its business in accordance with the specifications recorded on its VATS License. The VATS Licenses can be further categorized based on the specific business operations permitted to be carried out under such licenses, including among others, the VATS Licenses for internet information services, or the ICP License, and the VATS License for electronic data interchange business, or the EDI License. In addition, a VATS License holder is required to obtain approval from the original permit-issuing authority prior to any change to its shareholders, business scope or other information recorded on such license. In February 2015, the State Council issued the Decisions on Cancelling and Adjusting a Batch of Administrative Approval Items, which, among other things, replaced the pre-registration approval requirement for telecommunications businesses with a post-registration approval requirement.
 
In September 2000, the State Council promulgated the Administrative Measures on Internet Information Services, or the Internet Measures, most recently amended in January 2011. Under the Internet Measures, “internet information services” refer to the provision of information through the internet to online users, and are divided into “commercial internet information services” and “non-commercial internet information services”. Commercial internet information services operators shall obtain an ICP License, from the relevant government authorities within China. Chain Cloud Mall E-commerce (Tianjin) Co., Ltd., our VIE, holds our VATS License for our Value-Added Telecommunication businesses.
 
Regulations Relating to Internet Information Security and Privacy Protection
 
Internet information in China is regulated from a national security standpoint. The National People’s Congress, or the NPC, enacted the Decisions on Preserving Internet Security in December 2000 and amended in August 2009, which subject violators to potential criminal punishment in China for any attempt to: (i) gain improper entry into a computer or system of strategic importance; (ii) disseminate politically disruptive information; (iii) leak state secrets; (iv) spread false commercial information; or (v) infringe intellectual property rights. The Ministry of Public Security of the PRC, or the MPS, promulgated the Administrative Measures for the Computer Information Network and Internet Security Protection in December 1998 and amended in January 2011, which prohibits use of the internet in ways which, among other things, result in a leak of state secrets or a spread of socially destabilizing content. If an internet information service provider violates these measures, the MPS and its local branches may issue a warning, confiscate the illegal gains, impose fines, and, in severe cases, advise competent authority to revoke its operating license or shut down its websites.
 
Under the Several Provisions on Regulating the Market Order of Internet Information Services, issued by the MIIT in December 2011 and implemented in March 2012, an internet information service provider may not collect any user personal information or provide any such information to third parties without the consent of the user. An internet information service provider must expressly inform the users of the method, content and purpose of the collection and processing of such user personal information and may only collect such information necessary for the provision of its services. An internet information service provider is also required to properly maintain the user’s personal information, and in case of any leak or likely leak of the user’s personal information, the internet information service provider must take immediate remedial measures and, in severe circumstances, immediately report to the telecommunications authority. Moreover, pursuant to the Ninth Amendment to the Criminal Law issued by Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress (the “SCNPC”) in August 2015 and implemented in November 2015, any internet service provider that fails to fulfill the obligations related to internet information security administration as required by applicable laws and refuses to rectify such failure upon orders, shall be subject to criminal penalty for the result of (i) any dissemination of illegal information in large scale; (ii) any severe effect due to the leakage of the client’s information; (iii) any serious loss of criminal evidence; or (iv) other severe situation. Any individual or entity that (i) sells or provides personal information to others in a way violating the applicable law, or (ii) steals or illegally obtains any personal information, shall be subject to criminal penalty in severe situation. In addition, the Interpretations of the Supreme People’s Court and the Supreme People’s Procuratorate of the PRC on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in Handling Criminal Cases of Infringing Personal Information, issued in May 2017 and implemented in June 2017, clarified certain standards for the conviction and sentencing of the criminals in relation to personal information infringement.

In November 2016, the SCNPC promulgated the Cyber Security Law of the PRC, or the Cyber Security Law, which became effective on June 1, 2017. The Cyber Security Law requires that a network operator, which includes, among other things, internet information services providers, take technical measures and other necessary measures in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and the compulsory requirements of the national and industrial standards to safeguard the safe and stable operation of its networks. We are subject to such requirements as we are operating websites and mobile applications and providing certain internet services mainly through our mobile applications. The Cyber Security Law further requires internet information service providers to formulate contingency plans for network security incidents, report to the competent departments immediately upon the occurrence of any incident endangering cyber security and take corresponding remedial measures.
 
Internet information service providers are also required to maintain the integrity, confidentiality and availability of network data. The Cyber Security Law reaffirms the basic principles and requirements specified in other existing laws and regulations on personal data protection, such as the requirements on the collection, use, processing, storage and disclosure of personal data, and internet information service providers being required to take technical and other necessary measures to ensure the security of the personal information they have collected and prevent the personal information from being divulged, damaged or lost. Any violation of the Cyber Security Law may subject the internet information service provider to warnings, fines, confiscation of illegal gains, revocation of licenses, cancellation of filings, shutdown of websites or criminal liabilities.
 
Furthermore, MIIT’s Rules on Protection of Personal Information of Telecommunications and Internet Users promulgated in July 2013, effective September 2013, contain detailed requirements on the use and collection of personal information as well as security measures required to be taken by telecommunications business operators and internet information service providers.
 
Regulations Relating to Pyramid Selling in the PRC
 
The Regulations on Prohibition of Pyramid Selling, that were promulgated by the State Council in August 2005 and became effective in November 2005, prohibit pyramid selling activities. According to the Regulations on Prohibition of Pyramid Selling, the following activities taken by organizers or operators are considered as “pyramid selling”: (i) taking in new members and compensating each member by giving material awards or other financial benefits, based upon the number of new members directly or indirectly introduced by such member on a rolling basis, so as to gain illegal benefits; or (ii) requesting a sum of money as entry fee or as a condition to membership for new members, either directly or through purchasing commodities, so as to gain illegal benefits; or (iii) requesting members to introduce additional members to establish a multi-level relationship and compensating each member based on the level of sales generated by the additional members introduced by such member, so as to gain illegal benefits. The PRC laws and regulations have not defined “illegal benefit” and the determination of gaining “illegal benefit” is to a large extent subject to discretionary view of the competent authorities in the PRC. Any individual or entity engaging in organization of pyramid selling may be subject to confiscation of illegal gains and fines ranging from RMB0.5 million to RMB2.0 million (US$0.3 million), and criminal liabilities if a crime is committed. On March 23, 2016, the former State of Administration of Industry and Commerce (which has been merged into SAMR) promulgated the Risk Warning for New Types of Pyramid Selling, which provides that if an activity satisfies the three features stated above at the same time, it will be identified as pyramid selling, regardless of whether any illegal benefit is obtained. We believe we  do not request a sum of money as entry fee through purchasing commodities, our membership package, which individuals are required purchase to become a member of our platform, include a set of selected products or services and access to our app containing membership benefits and features. Also, we grant to our members upon a successful new member referral to blockchain points, which are not redeemable for cash and can only be used as coupons for future purchases on our platform. We also avoid establishing multi-level relationship of members, we grant members incentives only for products sold directly via the links that such member shares through his/her social network, and not for products sold via links shared by any other member that was originally invited by such member. In addition, since we have provided products of value and services to our members as consideration for purchasing our membership package, and the products on our platform are offered at market prices, we believe our current business practices do not constitute as gaining “illegal benefits.” We believe that our current business model is not in violation of applicable PRC laws and regulations, including the Regulations on the Prohibition of Pyramid Selling. See “Risk Factors—If our business model were found to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations, our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.”
