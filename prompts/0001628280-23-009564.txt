Unless expressly indicated or the context requires otherwise, the terms “SomaLogic,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” in this report refer to SomaLogic, Inc., and, where appropriate, our wholly-owned subsidiaries.
Company Overview
Overview
SomaLogic is a leading commercial-stage proteomics company. We have built an integrated proteomics platform that we believe is capable of robust, high throughput proteomics analysis with broad proteome coverage, low limits of detection, high reproducibility and at low costs. We designed our platform with the goal of being a universal proteomics platform, with the breadth (number of proteins measured) and precision (accuracy of measurement) important for discovery and research applications, and both the reproducibility and robustness important for clinical applications. Our platform is underpinned by our proprietary assay technology, our protein database (which we believe is one of the largest proteomics databases worldwide), and artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities. As of December 31, 2022, our assay can measure approximately 7,000 protein target measurements in a single sample using only approximately 55 µL of plasma, serum, or other matrices. Our proteomics database contains over 4.2 billion protein measurements and our clinical database contains over 675,000 participant-years of clinical follow-up. Leveraging our artificial intelligence-enabled bioinformatics capability, we use our database to power diagnostic product development for our research and clinical customers. We currently run our platform within our own laboratory, receive samples from customers and perform proteomics analysis on their behalf. 
Our foundational assay technology includes our library of modified aptamer protein identification reagents, referred to as “SOMAmer® reagents,” and our SomaScan® assay. Our SOMAmer® reagents are proprietary modified aptamers, which are short, synthetic single stranded DNA (ssDNA) sequences developed to bind specific protein targets with high affinity and specificity across the proteome. The SomaScan® assay is utilized for Research Use Only (“RUO”) applications, and our SomaSignal™ tests, which are run on the SomaScan® Platform, are available as Laboratory-Developed Tests (“LDT”) in the United States.
Life Sciences
Our business model is currently focused on customers conducting life sciences research or biopharmaceutical development. Our assay services delivered to the research market are focused on pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and academic and government research institutions. We facilitate drug development, analysis of clinical trials and new human biology insights by assessing protein-protein and protein-gene interaction networks. In addition to providing protein data for research customer use, as of December 31, 2022, we offered 29 SomaSignal™ RUO protein-pattern recognition tests covering multiple applications, including facilitation of clinical trials (patient inclusion/exclusion, therapeutic effects of pharmaceuticals during trials, and other use cases). We continue to work with collaborators to explore new applications of our technology for life sciences research and clinical proteomics. As a result of our significant government- or grant-funded customer base, whose cycles often coincide with government fiscal year ends, our business is subject to significant seasonal factors which may cause sales of our products to vary on a quarterly or yearly basis and increase the magnitude of quarterly or annual fluctuations in our operating results. 
Diagnostics
Our services and products delivered into the clinical market are focused on providing data-driven diagnostic tests aimed at enabling high predictive power of biological disease and risks to patients based on high-plex proteomic measurement and bioinformatics predictive model development. We offered 19 SomaSignal™ tests for use as LDTs under our Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”) certification as of December 31, 2022. We also have a pipeline of several unique tests that could be developed and use claims targeting multiple applications, including offerings for health and wellness, preventative medical and disease management for pharmaceutical companies, health system providers and payors. We have developed a number of health system partnerships in the United States which we are studying use cases and benefits for SomaSignal™ tests for patient populations.
Recent Developments
SomaLogic entered into an exclusive, multi-year partnership pursuant to a Collaboration Agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with Illumina Cambridge. Ltd. (“Illumina Cambridge”) and Illumina, Inc. (together with Illumina Cambridge, collectively, “Illumina”) to develop co-branded, distributable Next-Generation Sequencing (“NGS”) based proteomic products. As part of the collaboration, which began in early 2022, Illumina began developing NGS-based protein identification and measurement tools to be used in laboratories worldwide and facilitating the development and use of high-plex protein pattern recognition tests.
In August 2022, the Company completed its acquisition of Palamedrix, Inc., an innovator in DNA nanotechnology, which the Company intends to leverage as it develops the next generation of the SomaScan® Assay and which SomaLogic 
Index to Financial Statements

believes will accelerate the SomaScan Platform utilization in global biopharma and academic markets, as well as the emerging proteomic diagnostics space.
As part of a broader strategic review of the Company’s business and organizational structure in October 2022, the Company’s Board appointed Troy Cox, a current director of the Company and veteran executive in the life sciences industry, as Executive Chair of the Board with oversight responsibilities as the Company’s principal executive officer. In addition to the new executive leadership of Mr. Cox, and also in connection with the strategic review, in December 2022 the Company also began implementing a strategic reorganization involving, among other things, a workforce reduction and reprioritization of the Company’s operating costs and long-term growth strategy, including a renewed focus on the growth of the Company’s life sciences business.
Proteomics and Existing Technologies
Background
We believe the value of proteomics remains largely untapped. Over the past decade, the genomics revolution has led to an acceleration of biological insights arising from the development and incorporation into research and clinical medicine of large-scale, high-throughput molecular profiling techniques. Although increased knowledge of biological systems from the standpoint of both genomics and transcriptomics has led to significant scientific advancements and biological discoveries, we believe the critical role of protein function in human biology remains largely unexplored due to several inherent difficulties in proteomics, which do not exist in genomics and which slow technological progress to fully interrogate the proteome, such as the unique characteristics of each protein, including shapes, sizes (20,000 different protein structures versus the fairly simple structure of nucleic acid), half-lives, and presence in myriad locations throughout the human body in organs, tissues and cells (compared to the localization of nucleic acid in the nuclei of cells and in mitochondria). Therefore, unlike DNA, proteins can have unstable and variable chemical structures, and their presence in diverse human biological samples can span an exceptionally large dynamic range. This can make proteins difficult to detect and identify in a sample, especially at low concentrations. We believe that to extract the multidimensional networks of biological information encoded in proteins, researchers generally have to be able to measure many proteins at scale, over a very wide dynamic range, and with a high degree of precision (to suggest otherwise, we believe, would require an assumption that each of the 20,000 known protein-encoding genes selected over millions of years of human evolution is not important to the achievement of a complete understanding of human biology). In addition, we view robust and reproducible proteomic analysis as a requirement for driving adoption of proteomic tests in the clinical setting. Although there are several approaches widely practiced today that can identify and measure a large number of proteins, the ability to capture a sufficiently broad number of proteins with high accuracy and repeatability and therefore enable a more comprehensive picture of the dynamic state of a cell, tissue or organism has presented the life sciences industry with a difficult and ongoing challenge.
Key limitations of current proteomics technologies
We believe there are currently few widely practiced methodologies for broad interrogation of the proteome, and each has its own specific set of limitations. The key methodologies utilized today include mass spectrometry and antibody-based approaches. Protein sequencing and counting technologies are recent innovations in the field but, generally, are not applied commercially at scale. 
Our Offerings
We are using our platform to target life sciences research and development. Our offerings focused on life sciences research are intended for basic research, target identification and biomarker discovery, as well as translational research and biopharmaceutical development applications. We also have a clinical diagnostics business, through which we have established relationships with several large health systems in the United States. 
SomaLogic® Offerings and Applications
We have an established revenue stream from the life sciences research market, which as of December 31, 2022, consists primarily of a service model whereby we receive samples (including from pharmaceutical, biotechnology or academic clients), perform the SomaScan® assay, and subsequently use bioinformatics and analytics to further refine the collected data and deliver the results back to the customer.
SomaScan® Assay. As of December 31, 2022, our SomaScan® assay measures approximately 7,000 protein targets in a single sample, with planned development to expand to an approximately 10,000-plex assay for release in late 2023. The SomaScan® assay is designed to have breadth (or number of proteins measured), precision, specificity, dynamic range, depth (or lower limits of detection), and throughput. SomaScan® assay customers can also gain access to individual SOMAmer® reagents for a wide range of follow-up studies, which is a feature we consider to be a unique addition to our research services in comparison to the offerings of other proteomic platforms.
SomaScan® Certified Sites. The SomaScan Certified Sites program allows global pharmaceutical and biotech companies, academic and core labs, and government research institutions to run our industry leading proteomics platform 
Index to Financial Statements

on site with the same precision, robustness, and reproducibility seen in our assay services facility. Certified Sites run the assay on the same equipment as in the SomaLogic Assay Service facility utilizing a reagent based kit. 
SomaSignal™ Tests. As of December 31, 2022, we had 19 SomaSignal™ tests currently available for use as LDT under our CLIA certification, with several more in various stages of development. As of December 31, 2022, we have 29 RUO tests primarily targeting clinical trial applications, such as characterizing and monitoring patients through the clinical trial cycle. We believe our SomaSignal™ tests will provide health systems and national health services with a leading-edge scientific tool set to allocate resources, risk stratify both populations and individual patients and personalize therapy.
SOMAmer® Reagents. Customers have been granted licenses to use a limited subset of our SOMAmer reagents and to access to our Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential enrichment (“SELEX”) technology in three ways: (i) through the transfer of individual reagents that have been developed by SomaLogic, (ii) through the transfer of custom reagents developed by SomaLogic on behalf of a customer, and (iii) through the development of custom reagents by a customer after receiving a license to perform the SELEX process and to use the subsequently developed reagents. An example of the commercial use of SOMAmer® reagents by a licensee of SomaLogic is the inclusion of SOMAmer reagent-based inhibitors of thermophilic enzymes, such as polymerases used in a product category offered by certain biotechnology companies referred to as “hot-start” PCR amplification. 
Our Market Opportunity
Due to extensive existing applications and broad potential, we believe proteomics represents one of the largest untapped opportunities in the life sciences industry today. Currently, approximately 95% of FDA-approved drugs target a protein, and most other drugs interact with, or are influenced by, signal transduction cascades mediated by proteins. Our platform aims to address a large opportunity across multiple proteomics-based markets and is uniquely designed to attract, capture and retain customers representing a substantial share of each of these markets. With the increasing breadth of our foundational protein assay serving as a source for the development of new products and services, we believe we are well positioned to expand to adjacent markets within proteomics. Our target markets are life sciences research and biopharmaceutical development, and the breadth of our customers and collaborators demonstrate that we are establishing a market presence in both. 
Our Strategy 
Our goal is to drive adoption of our integrated platform of proteomic solutions and services in the life sciences research and biopharmaceutical development markets and then expand into other attractive markets. Our strategy centers on lowering barriers to adoption and actively engaging with our broad community of customers and KOLs to accelerate the adoption of proteomics. Our growth strategy includes:
•Drive adoption of our platform as the industry standard for discovery with life sciences research customers. 
•Create the case for enhanced pharmaceutical development productivity through proteomics, including the use of SomaSignal tests in clinical trials
•Leverage our database and artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities to strengthen our value proposition for our customers. 
•Strengthen our partnerships and collaborations to validate our integrated platform and expand its capabilities. 
•Enhance our integrated platform for use in decentralized settings through SomaScan® Certified Sites.
•Build commercial product development and sales channel relationships with Genomics, Transcriptomics and other molecular biology-based testing enterprises.
Manufacturing and Supply
We depend on our manufacturing and supply chain operations for reagents and other components we use in our products and solutions. Our suppliers and manufacturer are also the primary source of the instruments required to complete our assays and tests.
We currently have supply agreements with two single source suppliers, Agilent Technologies, Inc (“Agilent”) and Global Life Sciences Solutions USA LLC (“GLSS”). The agreement with Agilent, which was amended in November of 2021, relates to the supply of a microarray readout system, including slide and supporting reagents, and will terminate in April 2025 subject to the parties’ agreement to renew the agreement for an additional 2 years. The agreement with GLSS relates to the supply of streptavidin beads and has been extended through December 31, 2023. Additionally, we and our SomaLogic Certified Sites purchase from Tecan Trading AG (“Tecan”) the Fluent 780 automated liquid handling instrument to perform the current version of the SOMAscan assay. The SomaScan assay could be adapted to other commercially available automated liquid handling platforms, with suitable development time, if supply of the Tecan Fluent 780 is interrupted in the future.

Some of our products and services, such as our SomaScan® assay, utilize unique components, but the majority of the components that enable our products and services are commonly sourced or off-the-shelf. While we purchase some of the components and materials used in manufacturing our products and performing our services from single-source suppliers, we have qualified second sources for most, but not all, of our critical components and reagents. The loss of any of these suppliers could potentially harm SomaLogic. We believe alternatives would be available; however, it may take time to identify and validate replacement components, which could negatively affect our ability to supply our products and perform our services on a timely basis. To mitigate this risk, we typically carry a significant inventory of our critical components. For further discussion of the risks relating to our third-party suppliers, see the section entitled “Risk Factors.”
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part on our ability to maintain intellectual property protection for our products, services and technology. We utilize a variety of intellectual property protection strategies, including patents, trade secrets, trademarks and other methods of protecting proprietary information.
Patents
We have an extensive global patent portfolio to protect our proteomics platform, products and services. Our owned and controlled patents and pending applications, if issued, are expected to expire between 2023 and 2042, in each case without taking into account any possible patent term adjustments or extensions and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other government fees. Our proprietary, foundational aptamer chemistry and other technology is supported by approximately 950 patents (issued or pending), including granted patents and pending patent applications in-licensed from California Institute of Technology, such patent license assumed from our acquisition of Palamedrix, Inc., and supports unsurpassed sensitivity, specificity, and dynamic range.
Trademarks
We own various registered trademarks, trademark applications, and unregistered trademarks in the United States and in important markets outside the United States, including our company name and various product and service names, including SomaLogic, SomaSignal, SOMAmer, SomaScan, SomaScan by SomaLogic, and Powered by SomaLogic. Our trademark portfolio is designed to protect the brands for our products and services, both current and in the pipeline. 
Trade Secrets
In addition to our reliance on patent protection for our inventions, products and technologies, we also rely on trade secrets, know-how, confidentiality agreements and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, most of our aptamers and some elements of our analytical techniques and processes, as well as some of the bioinformatics methodologies and software used to analyze assay data, are based on unpatented trade secrets and proprietary know-how that has not been publicly disclosed. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees, advisors and consultants, these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. As a result, we may not be able to meaningfully protect and maintain our trade secrets.
In-Licensing of Intellectual Property
We do not currently rely on any third party in-licensed intellectual property to provide any of our services or products.
Out-Licensing of Intellectual Property
In June 2008, SomaLogic and New England Biolabs, Inc. (“NEB”) entered into an exclusive licensing agreement, whereby SomaLogic provides a license to use certain proprietary information and know-how relating to its aptamer technology to make and use commercial products. SomaLogic received royalties from NEB in exchange for this license. In September 2022, SomaLogic and NEB entered into a license and settlement agreement (“NEB Agreement”) that terminated the existing exclusive licensing arrangement and provided for a settlement of $8.0 million of owed royalties. The NEB Agreement also provided a non-exclusive license arrangement for the same proprietary information and know-how under which SomaLogic is guaranteed fixed minimum royalties of $15.0 million to be received over the term of the agreement. The license agreement will terminate in June 2028, after which the intellectual property rights behind the proprietary information and know-how and any previously unexpired licensed patents will have expired. 
We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. We cannot provide any assurance any of our current or future patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, or any of our current or future issued patents will effectively protect any of our products, services or technology or prevent others from commercializing infringing products, services or technology. For further discussion of the risks relating to intellectual property, see the section entitled “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”

Collaboration Agreements
SomaLogic has several collaboration agreements with collaborators to facilitate various research efforts focused on proteomic profiling of several diseases and conditions. Our current collaborators include many universities and private companies in the biotechnology space.
On September 20, 2019, SomaLogic entered into a Master Collaboration Agreement (“MCA”) with Novartis Pharma AG, a Swiss company (“Novartis”), pursuant to which the parties engage in collaborative research efforts to advance the study of proteomic medicine. Under the MCA, SomaLogic agrees to provide SomaScan® assay services to Novartis upon Novartis’s submission of samples to SomaLogic. Effective January 1, 2023, SomaLogic and Novartis entered into Amendment #2 to Master Collaboration (“Amendment 2”), under which the parties extended the term of the MCA until December 31, 2033 unless either earlier terminated by the parties in accordance with the MCA or extended for an additional five (5) years by mutual written agreement. Under the MCA, for services performed after the satisfaction of all Projected Annual Minimums (as defined in the Collaboration Agreement) in accordance with timelines contemplated by the MCA, the fees Novartis and its affiliates pay for samples provided by the Company will increase and, in lieu of annual minimums, Novartis will provide SomaLogic with rolling, non-binding forecasts of its assay requirements on a quarterly basis.
On March 30, 2020, SomaLogic entered into a Joint Development & Commercialization Agreement (the “JDCA”) with NEC Solution Innovators, Ltd. (“NES”). Under the JDCA, NES was granted (1) a ten (10) year exclusive license to certain of SomaLogic’s intellectual property to develop and commercialize tests in Japan for human healthcare management, which will convert to a non-exclusive license at the end of the ten (10) year period of exclusivity and then continue for the remainder of the term of the agreement; and (2) a non-exclusive license to develop and commercialize in Japan non-healthcare life sciences tests that employ SomaScan® services in exchange for annual payments for five (5) years and revenue sharing payments over the term of the agreement. Under the agreement, NES grants SomaLogic an exclusive license under NES’ and its affiliates’ technology and under any joint technology or patents to develop and commercialize tests in the rest of the world. 
On October 13, 2020, SomaLogic entered into an Amended and Restated Master SomaScan Discovery Services Agreement (“MSDS”) with Amgen Inc., a Delaware corporation based in California (“Amgen”), pursuant to which SomaLogic agrees to use its SomaScan® assay technology to study protein samples provided by Amgen and provides reports for such studies, as outlined in individual statements of work (“SOWs”) from time to time. Each individual SOW sets forth the sample requirements, and fees payable to SomaLogic pursuant thereto, that Amgen agrees to supply to SomaLogic in order for SomaLogic to provide SomaScan® assay services. The MSDS will terminate on October 13, 2025, unless earlier terminated by the parties in accordance with the MSDS and in any event not until any open SOW is completed.
On December 31, 2021, SomaLogic entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Illumina, in connection with the development of the Licensed Products and related commercial arrangements. Under the Collaboration Agreement, SomaLogic grants Illumina rights to use SOMAmer reagents and certain related intellectual property to develop, pursuant to a mutually agreed upon development plan, the Licensed Products, in exchange for, among other things, an upfront payment and certain royalty payments. Unless earlier terminated in accordance with its terms, the Collaboration Agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty period for the Licensed Products. 
Employees and Human Capital
Fostering and maintaining a strong, healthy culture is a key strategic focus. Our core values reflect who we are and the way our employees interact with one another, our customers, partners and shareholders. We believe this kind of corporate culture results in employees who are happier, more creative, and more productive.
As of December 31, 2022, after giving effect to our recent strategic reorganization, we had approximately 451 full-time employees, including a research and development team of more than 94 employees. Most of our employees hold an academic degree, with a significant number also holding advanced degrees. 
None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered under a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any material work stoppages and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good, healthy, and transparent. We actively engage with managers to collect feedback and ideas on how to improve our working environment.
Our ability to attract, acquire, develop, engage, and retain a diverse workforce is critical for us to execute our strategy and grow our business. We continuously monitor the hiring, retention and management of our employees. We regularly conduct confidential surveys to seek feedback from our employees and use those results to improve our workplace. We attract and reward our employees by providing market competitive compensation and benefit practices, including equity and cash incentives and recognition plans that extend to all levels in our organization. We invest in our workforce through education, training and development programs and offering tuition assistance programs for continuing education. The health and safety of our employees is a key priority, and we are committed to providing and maintaining a safe and healthy working environment. Compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations underlies the basis of applicable programs and policies we have in place. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented and will continue to 
Index to Financial Statements

implement measures to ensure the safety of our employees. We are continuously evaluating the guidance from federal and local authorities and have created strict policies and guidelines that put our employees’ health and safety first.
Facilities
Our corporate headquarters and laboratory facilities are located in Boulder, Colorado, where we lease approximately 77,000 square feet of space under three leases at 2945 Wilderness Place, 2950 Wilderness Place and 2995 Wilderness Place. One building lease terminates at the end of 2023 and the other two leases have extension options through 2026 and 2036. As a result of the Palamedrix acquisition, we also lease approximately 10,000 square feet of office and laboratory space in La Jolla, California and the lease terminates in 2024. 
We do not own any real property, and believe our current facilities are sufficient to meet our immediate needs. In anticipation of future growth, we believe we will be able to obtain additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms and on an acceptable timeline.
Competition
The life sciences market is highly competitive and dynamic. Other companies, both established and early-stage, have indicated they are designing, manufacturing, and marketing products and services for, among other things, multiplexed or high-throughput proteomic analysis. These companies include Nautilus, Olink, Quanterix, Quantum-Si and Seer, among others, each of which has products and services that may compete to varying degrees with some of our services and products. Some of these companies are actively executing their commercial and operating plans, actively commercializing products and services and growing established marketing teams and sales forces. Other competitors are developing technologies for the life sciences market which may lead to services and products that rival or replace our products over time.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced if our competitors develop and commercialize products or services that offer better performance or are more convenient and cost-effective to use than our products or services. However, we believe we are substantially differentiated from our competitors for a multitude of reasons, including our novel approach and platform, the unique and proprietary nature of our aptamer and other technology (developed over more than two decades), our rigorous product development processes and quality of science, our highly experienced and multidisciplinary teams, our breadth of both proteomics-research-enabling and applied clinical solutions, and our access to an immediate growing market with options to expand into adjacent market opportunities over time. 
Government Regulation
Our products are intended for either (1) RUO or (2) clinical use applications; our RUO products are not used for clinical applications. Our customers include entities such as healthcare providers, academic institutions, research laboratories, and biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Our products are used for obtaining proteomics information from pre-clinical or clinical trials, biomarker discovery, and monitoring patients’ physiological states, among others.
Under a long-standing FDA regulation and policy, in vitro diagnostic (“IVD”) products intended for research use only are subject to a regulatory classification separate from classifications for products with clinical use applications. In particular, products that are RUO and that comply with certain labeling requirements (e.g., labeling that explains that the product is RUO) are typically not regulated by the FDA as medical devices and are not subject to the regulatory requirements discussed below for clinical diagnostic products. Therefore, in many cases, RUO products can be used or distributed for research use without first obtaining FDA clearance, authorization, or approval. Such products must bear the statement: “For Research Use Only. Not for Use in Diagnostic Procedures,” and comply with other legal requirements. RUO products cannot make any claims related to safety, effectiveness or diagnostic utility, and they cannot be intended for human clinical diagnostic use.
In November 2013, the FDA issued final guidance on products labeled RUO, which, among other things, reaffirmed a company may not make any clinical or diagnostic claims about an RUO product, stating that merely including a labeling statement the product is for research purposes only will not necessarily render the device exempt from the FDA’s clearance, approval, or other regulatory requirements if the totality of circumstances surrounding the distribution of the product indicates the manufacturer knows its product is being used by customers for diagnostic uses or the manufacturer intends such a use. A product labeled RUO but intended or promoted for clinical diagnostic use may be viewed by the FDA as adulterated and/or misbranded under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and subject to FDA enforcement action. The FDA will consider several factors surrounding distribution and use of an RUO product, including how the product is marketed and to whom, when determining its intended use. If the FDA disagrees with a company’s RUO status for its product, the company may be subject to FDA enforcement actions. In addition, the FDA may require the company to seek clearance, authorization or approval for the product.
Clinical Diagnostics in the United States
In the United States, the FDA defines a medical device as an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent or other similar or related article, including any component part or accessory, which is (i) intended for 
Index to Financial Statements

use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals, or (ii) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals and which does not achieve any of its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of its primary intended purposes. Medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations. The laws and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, pre-market clearance, authorization or approval, establishment registration and product listing, product manufacturing, product packaging and labeling, product storage, advertising and promotion, product distribution, recalls and field actions, servicing and post-market clinical surveillance. A number of states in the United States also impose licensing and compliance regimes on companies that manufacture or distribute prescription devices into or within the state.
The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) also oversees the advertising and promotion of SomaLogic’s current and future products pursuant to its broad authority to police deceptive advertising for goods or services within the United States. Under the Federal Trade Commission Act, the FTC is empowered, among other things, to (a) prevent unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce; (b) seek monetary redress and other relief for conduct injurious to consumers; and (c) gather and compile information and conduct investigations relating to the organization, business, practices, and management of entities engaged in commerce. In the context of performance claims for products such as SomaLogic’s goods and services, compliance with the FTC Act includes ensuring there is scientific data to substantiate the claims being made, the advertising is neither false nor misleading, and any user testimonials or endorsements SomaLogic or its agents disseminate related to the goods or services comply with disclosure and other regulatory requirements.
IVDs are a type of medical device and include reagents and instruments used in the diagnosis or detection of diseases, conditions or infections, including, without limitation, the presence of certain chemicals, genetic information or other biomarkers. Predictive, prognostic, and screening tests can also be IVDs. Most medical devices, including IVD products, must undergo pre-market review by and receive clearance, authorization, or approval from the FDA prior to commercialization, unless the device is of a type exempted from such review by statute, regulation, or an FDA exercise of enforcement discretion.
The FDA classifies medical devices into three classes based on risk. The level of regulatory control increases from Class I (lowest risk) to Class III (highest risk). Marketing of most Class II and III medical devices within the United States must be preceded either by pre-market notification and FDA clearance pursuant to Section 510(k) of the FDCA or by the granting of a premarket approval application (“PMA”). Both 510(k) notifications and PMA applications must be submitted to the FDA with significant user fees, although reduced fees for small businesses are available. Class I devices are generally exempt from pre-market review and notification, as are some moderate-risk Class II devices. Manufacturers of all classes of devices must comply with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), establishment registration, medical device listing, labeling requirements, and medical device reporting (“MDR”) regulations, which are collectively referred to as medical device general controls. Class II devices may also be subject to special controls such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, FDA guidelines, or particularized labeling. Some Class I and Class II devices can be exempted by regulation from the requirement of compliance with substantially all of the QSR. The FDA currently exercises enforcement discretion with respect to the regulation of LDTs.
Regulation of Laboratory Developed Tests in the United States
Our SomaSignal™ tests are available as LDTs for use in obtaining proteomics information from patients and monitoring patients’ physiological states, among others. LDTs are generally considered to be tests that are designed, developed, validated and used within a single laboratory. The FDA has historically taken the position that it has the authority to regulate such tests as medical devices under the FDCA, but the FDA has exercised enforcement discretion for certain LDTs and has not required clearance, authorization, or approval of such LDTs prior to marketing, unless the product poses health or safety concerns or the product is a direct-to-consumer test. Laboratories certified as “high complexity” under CLIA may develop, manufacture, validate and run LDTs. The CLIA requirements are discussed below in the section entitled “United States Federal and State Regulation of Laboratories.” 
On October 3, 2014, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents proposing a new regulatory paradigm for oversight of LDTs. These draft guidance documents proposed more active review of LDTs. The draft guidance documents were the subject of considerable controversy, and in November 2016, the FDA announced that it would not be finalizing the 2014 draft guidance documents. On January 13, 2017, the FDA issued a discussion paper which laid out elements of a possible revised future LDT regulatory framework but did not establish any regulatory requirements. Meanwhile, the FDA issued several warning letters against marketers of LDTs, although focusing on issues that the FDA considered to pose high risks to the public. But in August 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) declared that FDA will not be requiring premarket reviews for LDTs unless the FDA issues such a requirement by notice-and-comment rulemaking. Following the change of the administration in 2021, it is not clear what the HHS or FDA policy will be on the regulation of LDTs. Given the changing regulatory requirement, the FDA may decide to take action against certain LDTs on a case-by-case basis if the FDA views them as presenting a risk to patients. The FDA may regulate products that it does not consider to be LDTs as medical devices that are subject to the requirements that are described above.

United States Federal and State Regulation of Laboratories
Given aspects of SomaLogic’s business at certain facilities involve acting as a clinical laboratory, SomaLogic is required to hold certain federal and state licenses, certifications and permits to conduct our business. As to federal certifications, CLIA establishes rigorous quality standards for all laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease, or the impairment of, or assessment of health. As a clinical laboratory, SomaLogic must obtain a CLIA certificate based on the complexity of testing performed at the laboratory, such as a Certificate of Compliance for high-complexity testing. CLIA also mandates compliance with various operational, personnel, facilities administration, quality and proficiency requirements, intended to ensure clinical laboratory testing services are accurate, reliable and timely. CLIA compliance and certification is also a prerequisite to be eligible to bill for services provided to government payors and for many private payors. Furthermore, SomaLogic is subject to survey and inspection every two years to assess compliance with program standards and may be subject to additional unannounced inspections. Laboratories performing high-complexity testing are required to meet more stringent requirements than laboratories performing tests that are not as complex.
In addition to CLIA requirements, SomaLogic participates in the accreditation program of the College of American Pathologists (“CAP”). CMS, the agency that oversees CLIA, has deemed CAP standards to be equally or more stringent than CLIA regulations and has approved CAP as a recognized accrediting organization. Inspection by CAP is performed in lieu of CMS inspections for accredited laboratories. Therefore, because SomaLogic is accredited by the CAP Laboratory Accreditation Program, we are deemed to also comply with CLIA. CLIA provides a state may adopt laboratory regulations more stringent than those under federal law, and a number of states have implemented their own more stringent laboratory regulatory requirements.
Select states have laboratory regulations that have been deemed by the federal government to be at least as stringent as CLIA, and thus laboratories licensed under those state regimes are exempt from CLIA and the state Department of Health is permitted to issue a CLIA number, along with a state Medical Test Site license, rather than a certificate being issued by CMS. State laws may require that laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality control procedures, facility requirements or prescribe record maintenance requirements. Several states additionally require the licensure of out-of-state laboratories that accept specimens from those states. For example, New York requires a laboratory to hold a permit, which is issued after an on-site inspection, and approval of each LDT offered by a laboratory, and has various, more stringent requirements than CLIA and CAP, including those for personnel qualifications, proficiency testing, physical facility and equipment and quality control standards.
If a clinical laboratory is found to be out of compliance with CLIA certification, CAP accreditation or a state license or permit, the applicable regulatory agency may, among other things, suspend, restrict or revoke the certification, accreditation, license or permit to operate the clinical laboratory, assess civil monetary penalties and impose specific corrective action plans, among other sanctions.
United States Fraud and Abuse Laws and Other Compliance Requirements
Successfully commercializing our clinical products and services depends on obtaining broad health insurance or third-party payor coverage. Government and private payors institute coverage criteria to ensure the appropriate utilization of products and services and to control costs. Limited third-party payor coverage for a technology or procedure may limit adoption and commercial viability, while broader coverage supports optimal market uptake. These laws can be implicated by inappropriate sales and marketing arrangements with healthcare providers. Many commonly accepted commercial practices are illegal in the healthcare industry and violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in United States federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. These laws may include, but are not limited to, (i) the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging of a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; (ii) the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented a false claim or the knowing use of false statements or records to obtain payment from the federal government; (iii) the federal Physician Self-Referral Law, also referred to as the Stark Law, which prohibits a physician (or an immediate family member of a physician) who has a financial relationship with an entity from referring patients to that entity for certain designated health services, including durable medical equipment and supplies, payable by Medicare, unless an exception applies; (iv) the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which authorizes the imposition of substantial civil money penalties against an entity that engages in certain prohibited activities including but not limited to violations of the Stark Law or Anti-Kickback Statute, and knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim; (v) analogous state laws intended to protect against fraud and abuse in the health care industry and more broadly; (vi) the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) of 1996, as amended by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and implementing regulations, which includes criminal prohibitions against healthcare fraud, embezzlement, and making false statements relating to healthcare matters; (vii) the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which prohibits United States corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad; and (viii) the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers to track and annually

report to CMS certain payments and other transfers of value made to United States-licensed physicians or United States teaching hospitals.
In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments and other transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities. Similar to the federal law, certain states also have adopted marketing and/or transparency laws relevant to device manufacturers, some of which are broader in scope. Certain states also mandate that device manufacturers implement compliance programs. Other states impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities. The need to build and maintain a robust compliance program with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements, resulting in fines and penalties.
United States and International Data Security and Data Privacy Laws
SomaLogic is or in the future may be subject to diverse laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security, including, in the United States, the California Consumer Privacy Act 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act 2020 (collectively, the “CCPA”) and HIPAA, in the United Kingdom (“UK”), the UK General Data Protection Regulation (“UK GDPR”), and, in the European Union (“EU”), Regulation 2016/679, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (“EU GDPR”) (the EU and UK GDPR collectively the “GDPR”). Some countries, such as Brazil, China, and Japan, have enacted or amended omnibus laws, and others, such as Russia, have also passed laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained in the country under certain circumstances and impose additional data transfer restrictions. In addition, India is considering proposed new privacy legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2022 (“PDP”). If enacted, the PDP will overhaul the personal data protection and regulatory regime in India. Complying with these numerous, complex and often changing regulations is expensive and difficult, and failure to comply with any privacy laws or data security laws or any security incident or breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized use or disclosure of personal data (including sensitive or confidential patient or consumer information), whether by SomaLogic or a third-party, could have a material adverse effect on SomaLogic’s business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations, including but not limited to: material fines and penalties; damages; litigation; consent orders; extensive audits and inspections; bans on all or some processing of personal data carried out by noncompliant actors; and injunctive relief. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR.
HIPAA, as well as a number of other federal and state privacy-related laws, extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, known as “protected health information” or “PHI.” HIPAA applies to health plans, healthcare providers who engage in certain standard healthcare transactions electronically, such as electronic billing, and healthcare clearinghouses, all of which are referred to as “covered entities” under HIPAA. HIPAA also directly regulates “business associates,” which are certain types of entities that act as service providers to covered entities and receive or have access to PHI as part of providing the relevant services to the covered entity customer. Business Associates are responsible for complying with certain provisions of HIPAA and can be subject to direct enforcement for violations of HIPAA. State imposed health information privacy and security laws typically apply based on licensure, for example, licensed providers or licensed entities are limited in their ability to use and share health information.
Additionally, many states have enacted legislation protecting the privacy and/or security of “personal data”. These laws overlap in certain circumstances and can apply simultaneously with federal privacy and security requirements and regulated entities must comply with all of them. The CCPA that went into effect January 1, 2020, is one of the most restrictive state privacy laws, protecting a wide variety of personal data and granting significant rights to California residents with respect to their personal data. In dealing with health information for the development of its technology or for commercial purposes, SomaLogic will be affected by HIPAA and state-imposed omnibus and health information privacy and security laws because these laws regulate the ability of SomaLogic’s potential customers and research collaborators to share personal data with SomaLogic and may in certain circumstances impose additional direct obligations on SomaLogic. Additionally, SomaLogic must also identify and comply with all applicable state laws for the protection of other types of personal data (e.g., consumer, employee, B2B information) that the company collects. In addition to the CCPA, many other states have proposed similar data privacy and security laws.
In the EU and UK, stringent data protection and privacy rules have and will continue to have substantial impact on the use of personal and patient data across the healthcare industry. The GDPR applies across the UK and EU (as well as the European Economic Area) and includes, among other things, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and significant fines for non-compliance. The GDPR fine framework can be up to 20 million euros, or up to 4% of the company’s total global turnover of the preceding fiscal year, whichever is higher. The GDPR sets out a number of requirements that must be complied with when handling the personal data of individuals (i.e., data subjects) in the UK and EU including: providing expanded disclosures about how their personal data will be used; higher standards for organizations to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent or have another legal basis in place to justify their data processing activities; the obligation to appoint data protection officers in certain circumstances; new rights for individuals to be “forgotten” and rights to data portability, as well as enhanced current rights (e.g., access requests); the principal of accountability and demonstrating compliance through policies, procedures, training and audit; and the new mandatory data breach regime. In particular, medical or health data, genetic data and biometric data,

where the latter is used to uniquely identify an individual, are all classified as “special category” data under the GDPR and are afforded greater protection and require additional compliance obligations. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, or orders to stop noncompliant activities. SomaLogic is subject to the GDPR since we offer products or services to individuals in the UK an EU or otherwise enter into contracts with UK and EU entities that handle the collection and processing of data of individuals within the UK and EU.
SomaLogic could also be subject to evolving UK and EU laws on data export, for transfers of data outside the UK and EU to itself or third parties. The GDPR only permits transfers of data outside the UK and EU to jurisdictions that ensure an adequate level of data protection. The United States has not been deemed to offer an adequate level of protection, so in order for SomaLogic to transfer personal data from the UK and EU to the United States, SomaLogic must identify a legal basis for data transfer (e.g., the European Union Commission and the UK’s Information Commission Officer approved Standard Contractual Clauses) and any supplementary measures taken, or to be taken, to provide an adequate level of protection for the data. On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union or the CJEU, issued a landmark opinion in the case Maximilian Schrems vs. Facebook (Case C-311/18), called Schrems II. This decision (a) calls into question commonly relied upon data transfer mechanisms as between the EU member states and the United States (such as the Standard Contractual Clauses) and (b) invalidates the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, an adequacy decision on which many companies had relied as an acceptable mechanism for transferring such data from the EU to the United States. The CJEU is the highest court in Europe and the Schrems II decision heightens the burden on data exporters and data importers to assess United States national security laws on their business and future actions of EU data protection authorities are difficult to predict. Negotiations are underway between the US and EU for the approval of a new data privacy framework (“Framework”) whereby companies that adhere to the Framework will be able to receive EU personal data without having to put in place additional transfer safeguards. The Framework, if ultimately approved by the European Commission, will almost certainly face legal challenge.
In China, rules relating to personal data protection and data security are part of a complex framework and are found across various laws and regulations. The three main pillars of the personal data protection framework in China are the Personal Information Protection Law (“PIPL”), the Cybersecurity Law (“CSL”), and the Data Security Law (“DSL”). The DSL came into force on September 1, 2021, and focuses on data security across a broad category of data (not just personal data). Most significantly, the PIPL came into effect on November 1, 2021. The PIPL is the first comprehensive, national–level personal data protection law in the China. The PIPL mirrors certain provisions found under the GDPR such as the purpose limitation principle, the concept of a data protection officer, data subject rights, the requirement to conduct data protection impact assessments, and restrictions on data exports. With respect to data exports, China has adopted its own standard contractual clauses which qualifying businesses can use to legitimize their data exports. 
Other Governmental Regulation
SomaLogic is subject to laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, the health and safety of employees and the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials. For example, the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, has established extensive requirements relating specifically to workplace safety for employers in the United States. This includes requirements to develop and implement multi-faceted programs to protect workers from exposure to blood-borne pathogens, including preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick injuries. For purposes of transportation, some biological materials and laboratory supplies are classified as hazardous materials and are subject to regulation by one or more of the following agencies: the United States Department of Transportation, the United States Public Health Service, the United States Postal Service and the International Air Transport Association. We generally use third-party vendors to dispose of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and radioactive materials that we may use during our research.
International Laws and Regulations for IVD Products
Whether or not we are required to comply with requirements for marketing clinical diagnostic products in the United States, we anticipate that we will still be required to obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in non-United States countries prior to the marketing of any product for clinical diagnostic use in those countries. The regulations in other jurisdictions vary from those in the United States and may be easier or more difficult to satisfy and are subject to change. For example, the EU published in 2017 new regulations that will result in greater regulation of medical devices and IVDs. This new IVD regulation (“new IVD Regulation”) is significantly different from the European directive for in vitro diagnostic products that it replaces in that it will ensure that the new requirements apply uniformly and on the same schedule across the member states, include a risk-based classification system and increase the requirements for conformity assessment. The new IVD Regulation will become fully applicable in May 2022, and it will increase the requirements for covered products and involve conformity assessments done by third parties that are designated under the IVD Regulation as notified bodies.
Outside of the EU, regulatory authorization needs to be sought on a country-by-country basis in order for us to market any clinical diagnostic products. Some countries have adopted medical device regulatory regimes, such as the Classification Rules for Medical Devices published by the Hong Kong Department of Health, the Health Sciences Authority of Singapore regulation of medical devices under the Health Products Act, and Health Canada’s risk classification system for invasive devices, among others, that incorporate IVD products like the FDA’s current system. Each country may have its own

processes and requirements for IVD licensing, approval/clearance, and regulation, therefore requiring us to seek any regulatory approvals on a country-by-country basis.
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. We also qualify as a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act, and as such we may also take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies.
We may choose to take advantage of some, but not all, of the available exemptions. We have taken advantage of certain reduced reporting obligations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These include extended transition periods for complying with new or revised accounting standards, an attestation of our internal controls as required by Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, providing only two years of audited financial statements, and scaled disclosures in our MD&A. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different than the information you receive from other public companies in which you hold stock. To the extent we take advantage of any reduced disclosure obligations, it may make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.
