Item 1. Business
Overview
 We are a clinical-stage healthcare company with a differentiated, chemistry-driven approach focused on leveraging the microbiome to treat disease and improve human health. We have built a human-centric proprietary product platform for discovery and development that we believe will enable the rapid advancement of a broad portfolio of novel product candidates using either human clinical studies under regulations supporting research with food or clinical trials as drug candidates. Our product candidates are Microbiome Metabolic Therapies (“MMT” or “MMTs”) which are designed to modulate the metabolic output and profile of the microbiome by driving the function and composition of existing microbes. We have an industrialized approach to the discovery and development of MMTs, and our initial MMTs are targeted glycans. Each targeted glycan is an ensemble of complex carbohydrates that is intended to modulate microbial metabolism and community composition to drive a specific biological response. We believe our MMTs have the potential to be novel treatments across a variety of diseases and conditions.
 The human microbiome is generally a community of more than 30 trillion microbes, organisms that include bacteria, viruses, archaea and fungi, which reside on and inside the human body. By evolving together over thousands of years, microbes and humans have developed an intricate and mutually beneficial relationship. Given the profound impact that microbes have on human health, this highly complex microbial ecosystem has been referred to as a “newly discovered organ.” There is a growing body of research that links a healthy microbiome with overall human health, while dysbiosis, or imbalance, in the microbiome has been correlated with numerous human conditions including those that cause significant morbidity and mortality. Some of these conditions include irritable bowel syndrome, Parkinson’s disease, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cancer, allergies and ulcerative colitis. The gut microbiome remains a largely untapped frontier in healthcare, and we believe that we are uniquely positioned to succeed in translating its promise into solutions for human health.
 To date, therapeutic approaches to the microbiome have focused primarily on adding or subtracting bacteria, either through fecal microbiota transplant, the introduction of a consortia of bacteria, single strain approaches or antibiotics. We believe our approach is novel in that we seek to deliver MMTs that drive the function and distribution of the gut microbiome’s existing microbes, enabling an industrialized approach to treat disease and improve human health.
 We have developed proprietary synthetic chemistry technologies that allow us to create MMT candidates. We believe the key characteristics of our MMT candidates include that they are orally administered, have limited systemic exposure and are selectively metabolized, structurally diverse, readily scalable, novel and proprietary. We believe that each of our MMT candidates works through one or more mechanisms of action, including decreasing production of metabolites, such as ammonia and trimethylamine generated by bacteria in the microbiome; increasing 
 7


production of metabolites, such as short chain fatty acids generated by bacteria in the microbiome; and advantaging or disadvantaging certain existing species in the microbiome community (such as decreasing pathogenic bacteria).
 Utilizing our proprietary product platform, we have created a library of more than 1,500 MMT candidates to probe the structure-activity relationships of our MMTs. Our MMT library is continuously growing as we continue to invest in techniques and technologies for chemical synthesis. Our MMT candidates and aspects of the proprietary product platform are supported by our expanding intellectual property portfolio, that includes twelve U.S. patents, two European Patent Office, or EPO, patents and more than 125 non-provisional applications pending worldwide.
 
Through the use of our proprietary product platform, the effect of MMTs is first tested ex vivo using a highly multiplexed advanced screening platform with microbiome communities from both healthy and patient populations. To establish how MMTs impact therapeutically relevant pathways, a broad range of bioanalytical technologies are used to analyze metabolites, effector molecules and host responses, while sequencing determines key microbial community changes. A candidate MMT may then either undergo further testing in animal models or go straight into clinical evaluation in humans. 
 Abbreviated development may be possible because in some cases MMTs are synthesized from naturally occurring carbohydrate monomers, are orally administered with limited systemic exposure and can be designated as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS). This enables us to gain valuable insights into our MMT candidates’ effects on the microbiome and human health before choosing to allocate additional time and capital to proceed to develop a drug product candidate under an IND or regulatory equivalent outside the United States.
 In our human clinical studies, we are able to measure safety, tolerability and potential markers of effect, which allows us to assess the potential use of our MMT candidates in humans. In less than one year, we advanced our urea cycle disorder program from a mechanistic hypothesis to dosing in human clinical studies. Furthermore, we initiated our first Phase 2 clinical trial under an IND approximately two years after conducting our first ex vivo screening. We believe that this provides support for our belief that our approach is more expeditious and cost efficient than traditional drug development. 
 We, and our wholly owned subsidiaries, Cadena Bio, Inc. and Kaleido Biosciences Securities Corporation (collectively referred to as the “Company”) were incorporated in Delaware on January 27, 2015 and have a principal place of business in Lexington, Massachusetts.

Our Strategy
 We are driven by our mission to lead a revolution in health by leveraging the microbiome to treat a broad range of diseases and conditions. Key elements of our strategy are to:

• | Harness the insights and data generated through our human-centric proprietary product platform to efficiently and rapidly advance a pipeline of MMTs to ultimately deliver products that address significant unmet patient needs. Our human-centric discovery and development enables us to rapidly advance our MMT candidates into clinical studies, which we believe gives us an advantage in both speed and cost as compared to traditional drug development. With more than 1,500 MMTs in our library, we plan to continue to build a broad range of pipeline opportunities in areas where there is a significant unmet need for products that are differentiated, meaningful, and relevant to patients. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage our differentiated approach, knowledge and unique expertise to lead efforts to expand the scientific understanding of the microbiome and its impact on human health. We believe that we are well positioned to translate the rapidly increasing understanding of the role of the microbiome in health and disease, into therapeutics that target important unmet patient needs, given our differentiated, chemistry-driven approach, our human-centric discovery and development as well as the knowledge and expertise of our leadership team, Board of Directors and Scientific Advisory Board. We will continue to collaborate with other leaders in the field to learn more about the potential of our MMTs to address various diseases and conditions as well as advance the broader understanding and applications of modulating the microbiome. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advance pipeline programs in disease areas with an established connection between the microbiome and the disease. There is growing evidence demonstrating the impact the microbiome has on a wide range of diseases, such as immune-driven and inflammatory disease, metabolic diseases and infectious diseases. The gut microbiome is a largely untapped frontier in healthcare, and we are well positioned to translate its potential into solutions for patients.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Selectively enter into strategic partnerships to maximize the value of our platform and pipeline. Given our potential to generate novel product candidates that could address a wide variety of diseases and conditions, we may enter into strategic collaborations around certain targets, product candidates or disease areas that we believe could benefit from the resources of companies that specialize in these areas. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Further strengthen and expand our intellectual property portfolio. We believe we have a robust intellectual property portfolio to support our programs, with twelve U.S. patents, two EPO patents, and more than 125 non-provisional applications pending worldwide, including composition of matter and method of use patents and patent applications. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We intend to further strengthen and expand our intellectual property portfolio to protect our proprietary product platform and product candidates.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Build on our foundation of people who are committed to scientific innovation, transforming lives and fostering a strong culture. We will strive to continue to attract and retain top talent who bring critical expertise in areas across our business and share a commitment to our mission and values. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Approach
 Due to the rapid nature of bacterial growth, the microbiome is inherently amenable to swift change, and it can be readily modulated using existing approaches, such as changes in diet and treatment with antibiotics. Importantly, because microbes in the gut can thrive on compounds, in particular glycans, that are generally not bioavailable to humans, effective targeted modulators of microbial metabolism should have low bioavailability and low systemic exposure. As a result, we believe that targeted modulators will likely have limited off-target activity in humans compared with traditional pharmaceutical agents.

Our MMTs
 We have developed proprietary synthetic chemistry technologies that we believe allow us to create our MMT candidates. MMTs are novel synthetic glycans that serve as metabolic and growth substrates for the microbiome. We believe the key characteristics of our MMT candidates include the following:
  
• | Orally administered — Our MMT candidates are highly soluble and are orally administered.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Limited systemic exposure — Our MMT candidates have been observed to have limited systemic exposure after oral administration, minimizing off-target biological effects.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Selectively metabolized — We design MMT candidates that are selectively metabolized by bacteria in the microbiome through the use of specialized enzymes. Species of gut bacteria are ecologically differentiated by their abilities to metabolize different glycans, making glycan delivery a powerful way to specifically modulate the composition, activity and metabolic output of the microbiome and improve host health.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Structurally diverse — Our MMT candidates are not a single, structurally-defined molecule, but rather an ensemble of molecules with a variety of structures. This structural complexity and specificity of action differentiates MMTs from any individual dietary fiber, and we believe that this is the primary factor for their differentiated microbiome activity.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Readily scalable — Our MMT candidates are produced using proprietary, standard small molecule unit operations. These methods have been proven scalable and cost-effective.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Novel and proprietary — Our MMT candidates are protected by what we believe to be a robust intellectual property portfolio, including by composition of matter and method of use patents.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that our MMT candidates work through one or more mechanisms of action that may have profound effects on human health in a variety of diseases and adverse conditions, including immune-driven, inflammatory disease, metabolic diseases and infectious diseases and conditions, including:
  
• | Decreasing production of metabolites — By decreasing the production of certain metabolites that have an adverse effect in a specific disease content, we believe our initial MMT candidates can result in improvements in targeted conditions where excess metabolites are a key driver of dysfunction.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increasing production of metabolites — By increasing the production of certain metabolites that have a beneficial effect in a specific disease context, we believe our initial MMT candidates can result in improvements in targeted conditions where certain metabolites are missing or not sufficient.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advantage or disadvantage certain species in the microbiome community — By modulating the distribution of existing species of bacteria within the microbiome (including pathogens), we believe our initial MMT candidates can result in improvements in targeted conditions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Building Our MMT Library
 Utilizing our proprietary product platform, we have created a library of more than 1,500 MMT candidates to probe the structure-activity relationships of our MMTs and the microbiome. Our MMT library is growing as we continue to invest in techniques and technologies for chemical synthesis.
 MMT Synthesis
 We synthesize MMT candidates using our proprietary chemistry technologies, which take advantage of the reactivity of carbohydrates and utilize defined mixtures of monosaccharides or polysaccharides as starting materials. We have methodically explored this approach to create a library of initial MMT candidates that vary across a wide range of structural features, including molecular weight, branching, regiochemistry and stereochemistry. By changing certain conditions and parameters, we can generate MMT candidates that have both larger and smaller variances on these structural features. The resulting MMT candidate library can then be used to explore the impact that structure has on the biology of the microbiome. We continue to develop other novel approaches to synthesize MMT candidates.
 10


We have made extensive commitments to discovering cost-effective and proprietary synthetic methods that can produce MMT candidates that drive diverse microbial responses. We believe our computational capabilities enable robust, efficient structural characterization and cross-batch comparison, reducing laborious manual processing steps typically required to determine the structure of complex carbohydrates.
 

We developed an ex vivo assay that allows the efficient and highly multiplexed screening MMT candidates using healthy volunteer and patient microbiomes. This unique screening and lead-identification process combines advances in drug discovery with microbiome science and is designed to measure the impact of MMTs on a variety of endpoints. To date, we have employed this process to screen a majority of our more than 1,500 MMT candidates for their ability to modulate bacterial metabolites with a documented role in the microbiome-host cross talks underlying the risk for, onset of and progression of disease. In addition, we have deployed this to measure, bacterial growth and community composition. Typically, after screening our library in microbiome samples from healthy volunteers, we test the identified lead compounds in samples from the patient population of interest. This provides the evidence needed to progress directly into clinical studies in healthy subjects, and in many cases, directly into patients or employ additional clinically relevant animal models. Furthermore, we utilize specific in vitro as well as animal models to test hypothesis on mechanism of action.
 Rapid advancement into human clinical studies
 Regulatory approach: food and drug
 Our regulatory approach to developing MMT candidates utilizes clinical research under both food law and drug law. Under this approach, human data is collected earlier in the process as compared to traditional drug development and data collected under both clinical studies and clinical trials may be included in regulatory filings, including filings for marketing approval. The MMT candidates we have been evaluating for use in modulating the microbiome can be classified as food or as drug ingredients depending upon their intended use. When intended for nutrient use to affect the structure or function of the body, they are conventional food or dietary supplement ingredients. For the dietary management of disease, the MMTs could be developed as medical foods. When intended for the prevention, cure, diagnosis or treatment of disease, they are drug candidates. We have initially studied several of our MMT candidates following food regulation and guidance. We have therefore been able to advance them rapidly into human clinical studies under regulations supporting research with food. These clinical studies are run under guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) and collect similar data as studies run under an IND or CTA. Therefore, these data can support filing an IND at Phase 2 or later, with the ultimate decision based on discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) or comparable foreign regulatory authorities.
 Food substances for human use are regulated by the FDA to assure that intended exposures are safe in the general population. This assurance can be provided by a food additive regulation, or by determination by qualified experts that the substance is Generally Recognized as Safe (“GRAS”).
 Although food additives must be evaluated by the FDA’s Office of Food Additive Safety through a food additive petition prior to human use, this requirement excludes “substances that are generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate their safety as having been adequately shown to be safe under the conditions of their intended use.” This can be established through a GRAS determination.
 For a substance to be determined to be GRAS, the scientific data and information about its use must be widely known, and there must be a consensus among qualified experts that data and information establish that the substance is safe under the conditions of its intended use and that it meets the standard of “reasonable certainty of no harm.”
 A GRAS determination by qualified experts is sufficient to support clinical studies of food in humans. We rely on qualified experts from scientific consulting organizations that are highly experienced in conducting both GRAS evaluations to conduct initial safety assessments of our MMT candidates. These third-party assessments evaluate whether our MMTs are safe for intended use in human clinical studies that are intended to evaluate safety and tolerability and the effects of our MMTs on the structure and function of the microbiome. The resulting conclusion that a substance is GRAS is called a self-determination of GRAS. 
 11


Our MMT candidates have been observed to have limited systemic exposure after oral administration, minimizing off-target biological effects. The direct adverse effects that we have observed to date are limited to the symptoms associated with bacterial metabolism when orally administered, such as bloating, flatulence, abdominal cramping and pain and diarrhea, and not those generally associated with systemic exposure. These symptoms are the known dose limiting side effects, and they are localized and generally found to be mild and transient. We believe that we can achieve significantly higher doses with our MMT candidates before triggering dose-limiting side effects, unlike naturally occurring complex carbohydrates, which often result in tolerability challenges at even moderate dosage levels.
 When a food substance is intended for the diagnosis, cure, treatment or prevention of disease, then it is regulated as a drug ingredient. If our corporate strategy supports development of an MMT as a drug product, we will need to file an IND with FDA and obtain IND clearance from the FDA before commencing therapeutic clinical trials. An IND requires submission of additional information, including the information that supports the safety of the product for the intended population to be studied and planned exposure, non-clinical toxicology, details of the manufacturing and testing, and clinical protocols describing the proposed human therapeutic clinical trial(s). Equivalent requirements apply for drug clinical studies to be conducted outside the U.S.
 Our approach to human clinical studies
 Through human clinical studies, we believe that we can gain valuable insights into the effects our MMTs have on the microbiome and human health. We are able to measure safety and tolerability and potential markers of effect in these studies, which allows us to assess the potential therapeutic and non-therapeutic viability of our MMT candidates in humans. We can also test multiple MMT candidates in the same clinical study, which allows us to assess which MMT candidate shows more potential based on in vivo testing.
 For all human clinical studies not conducted under an IND, we will adhere to FDA guidance and best practice for food clinical trials. Furthermore, each of our clinical investigators attests that the protocol and study activities adhere to the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, or ICH, guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, or GCP. All studies must receive Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) and Ethics Committee (“EC”) approval.
 These human clinical studies also allow us to decide whether to file an IND or regulatory equivalent outside the U.S. and investigate the MMT as a drug or continue to develop a specific MMT candidate for non-drug applications. For drug applications, based on discussions with applicable regulatory authorities, we believe we can open INDs or global equivalents for our MMTs as late as Phase 3. Available data would include an abbreviated toxicology package safety review of human experience and use and results of clinical studies. Our experience in our lead programs supports this approach for those of our MMTs which we decide to develop as potential therapeutics after evaluating the data from human clinical studies. For our KB195 program in UCD, we advanced into a Phase 2 trial under an IND. For future programs, we received feedback from the FDA that allows for opening an IND at Phase 3.  While each program and the specific MMT candidate that we select for such program will need to be independently evaluated by the FDA, we believe that our clinical study data collected under food regulations and following GCP would be accepted by the FDA.
 Data from these human clinical studies also inform our activities in discovery and development. Gathering in vivo human data early in the discovery process, together with chemical synthesis and high-throughput screening, allows us to rapidly iterate and improve MMT candidates based on in vivo effects and to continue to build a broader understanding of both our MMTs and the microbiome in general.
 
COVID-19
 Disease overview
 Coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) is a severe acute respiratory syndrome that was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has since spread globally, including to the United States and European countries, infecting over 110 million people since 2019 and this number is growing. Symptoms of COVID-19 which may 
 12


appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus, include fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, or diarrhea.

Currently available therapies
 The treatment for this virus is supportive health care for mild to moderate cases and may include oxygen, corticosteroids, or other therapeutics. In 2020, the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) and therapeutics which makes these products available quickly during the public health emergency. The therapeutic agents granted EUAs during the COVID-19 pandemic include convalescent plasma, remdesivir and baricitinib in combination with remdesivir for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and multiple monoclonal antibodies for patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. 
 
COVID-19 and immune response
 COVID-19 infection has been associated with activation of an inappropriate inflammatory cascade, which in some patients can cause an abnormally aggressive immune response that can lead to pneumonia and respiratory failure. Metabolites such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by the microbiome through utilization of glycans are modulators of the immune response and therefore could play a role in improved ability of the immune system to clear the virus as well as limiting an excessive inflammatory cascade. In preclinical models, increased SCFAs and/or SCFA-producing taxa, have been shown to influence immune pathways, mitigate immune pathology, and improve survival and morbidity associated with severe respiratory viral infections.
 Commensal microbiota composition critically regulates innate and adaptive immune response and has shown to play a role in the generation of virus-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells and antibody responses following respiratory influenza virus infection. In-humans, the data also support the role of SCFAs in reducing the impact of viral infections. In patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplants who have contracted respiratory viral infections, including coronavirus, the presence of SCFA-producing taxa has been associated with a significantly reduced risk of progression to lower respiratory tract infections, which can have substantial effect on morbidity in this patient population. 
 KB109 in addition to Supportive Self Care (SSC)in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19
 MMT candidate KB109 has been self-determined as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) for its intended use and was selected for evaluation in these COVID-19 non-IND clinical studies based on its demonstrated ability to increase production of SCFAs as well as to promote commensal bacteria and reduce pathogenic bacteria ex vivo. The non-IND clinical studies were designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of KB109 in non-hospitalized patients who were advised by their healthcare provider to receive self-supportive care, to chart the natural history of COVID-19 in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, and to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the gut microbiome structure and function.
 Adult patients in a non-IND clinical study were randomized within 48 hours of testing positive for COVID-19 to either receive SSC or SSC plus KB109 for two weeks and then followed for an additional three weeks. The planned interim analysis comprised approximately half of the total study population (n=176) and showed that KB109 was well tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with previous studies of MMT candidates and no unexpected treatment-related adverse events in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.
 Approximately 40 percent of the patients reported at least one comorbidity at baseline. Preliminary results from an interim analysis showed that the presence of comorbidity lengthened the time to resolution of symptoms in mild to moderate COVID-19 disease. In the SSC alone arm, median time to resolution of the thirteen overall COVID-19 related symptoms in patients with no comorbidities was 14 days as compared with 27 days in patients with at least one comorbidity. While no difference in median time to resolution of symptoms was observed with KB109 plus SSC for the overall population, small differences between the arms were observed during the follow-up period. For patients reporting one or more comorbidities, the median time to resolution of the thirteen overall COVID-19 related symptoms was 18 days with KB109 plus SSC and 27 days with SSC alone. 
 In the interim analysis, we also evaluated eight cardinal COVID-19 related symptoms as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which showed median time to resolution of symptoms among patients with one or 
 13


more comorbidity at baseline was 15 days for the KB109 plus SSC group as compared with 27 days with SSC alone. These interim findings require confirmation from the full dataset. The K031 study of 350 subjects is fully enrolled with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. Topline data from a smaller 50 subject study of KB109 is also expected in the first quarter of 2021.
 Ulcerative Colitis
 Disease overview
 Ulcerative colitis (“UC”) is a chronic disease of the large intestine, in which the lining of the colon becomes inflamed and develops tiny open sores, or ulcers. Those ulcers produce pus and mucus, cause abdominal pain and result in the need to frequently empty the colon. UC is the result of several factors that are not yet well understood. Abnormal immune response, genetics, microbiome, and environmental factors all contribute to the disease. There is no medical cure for UC and it can occur at any age, though most people are diagnosed prior to their mid-30s. In the United States, approximately one million people are affected with UC. The disease symptoms vary from person to person and over half of all UC patients experience mild-to-moderate symptoms. Reported symptoms include loose stool and urgent bowel movements, bloody stool, abdominal cramps and pain, and persistent diarrhea accompanied by abdominal pain and blood in the stool.
 Currently available therapies
 There is no known curative treatment for the disease. Treatment is multifaceted and includes the use of medication, alterations in diet and nutrition, and sometimes surgical procedures to repair or remove affected portions of a patient’s gastrointestinal tract.
 Several types of medication can be used to suppress UC symptoms (induce remission) and decrease the frequency of symptom flares (maintain remission) including anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppressants, and biologics. UC is often a progressive disease meaning that over time patients respond less to a specific medication and need to progress to other treatments.
 Ulcerative Colitis and KB295
 Evidence suggests that a feature of UC is alteration of the gut microbiome, including an increase in pro-inflammatory bacteria and decrease in commensal diversity which interfere with the normal immune response. In ex vivo studies, KB295 has demonstrated the ability to increase the production of short chain fatty acids and suppress the growth of inflammatory bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae. 
 We are conducting a non-IND clinical study evaluating MMT candidate KB295 in patients with mild-to-moderate UC. This non-IND open label, single arm clinical study is expected to enroll up to 30 patients with mild-to-moderate UC. Patients will receive KB295 for eight weeks titrated up to 40g twice daily and then enter a one-month follow-up period. The study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of KB295 and other assessments including the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index composite score, changes in microbiome composition and biomarkers of inflammation. Top line data for the study are expected in mid-2021.
 
The Role of the Microbiome in Ammonia Metabolism
 Urea cycle disorders (“UCD”) and hepatic encephalopathy (“HE”) are two diseases that are characterized by elevated plasma ammonia. Production of ammonia is a normal byproduct of protein breakdown and bacteria in the gut contribute a significant proportion of the normal load of ammonia produced during the course of the day. In healthy individuals, ammonia is processed into urea through the urea cycle, predominantly in the liver, and is subsequently excreted in the urine. When the urea cycle is disrupted or liver function is impaired, ammonia cannot be processed normally and can build up in the bloodstream to dangerous concentrations.
 Ammonia is produced by the microbiome through two major pathways — deamination of amino acids and urease-mediated hydrolysis of urea. Additionally, because nitrogen is a critical component of many biomolecules, including proteins and nucleic acids, bacteria need to rapidly replenish nitrogen stores during growth. Many species of bacteria will accomplish this by assimilating ammonia.
 14


Our MMT candidates may reduce microbiome ammonia levels by affecting these pathways and expect that a net reduction in gut ammonia production in UCD and HE patient populations should result in a net reduction of ammonia levels in their blood. In each of these diseases, addressing hyperammonemia represents an unmet medical need.
 Urea Cycle Disorders 
 Disease overview
 UCD is a serious and life-threatening inherited, rare genetic disease caused by a deficiency in one of the six enzymes or two amino acid transporters that constitute the urea cycle which is responsible for removing ammonia from the bloodstream. UCD can lead to hyperammonemia. Hyperammonemic crises can be fatal and may be precipitated by routine childhood illnesses or any other stress, such as surgery, that causes the body to break down protein. 
 The estimated incidence of UCD is 1 in 35,000 live births in the United States and Europe. Mortality rates in UCD is reported at 5%, the majority of whom die in the neonatal period. We estimate that there are approximately 3,000 patients with UCD in the United States and approximately 4,500 in Europe. 
 Currently available therapies 
 The long-term management of patients with UCD includes a combination of (often severe) dietary restrictions to reduce protein intake and dietary non-drug products. If these measures are insufficient to control hyperammonemia, patients are typically prescribed nitrogen binding therapy “NBT”). In one UCD subtype — N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency — carglumic acid, which is an activator of a key enzyme missing in that genetic defect, is an additional treatment option. In some patients, manifestations may be so severe as to necessitate a liver transplant.
 Clinical development in UCD and KB195
 KB195 is our lead MMT candidate for development in the treatment of patients with UCD. We selected KB195 after assessing its performance in reducing ammonia relative to a wide range of other MMTs, as well as several controls, in ex vivo screening of microbiome samples from healthy volunteers, as well as microbiome samples from patients with UCD. We are currently conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial under an IND and approved CTAs in a number of countries. 
 The goal of the UCD program is to develop a potential treatment for UCD that significantly improves the clinical outcomes by reducing serum ammonia levels; thereby reducing the risk of life-threatening hyperammonemic crises. The objective of the program is to stabilize a greater percentage of UCD patients that are on currently available therapies, and, if data support, move to a first-line nitrogen-binding therapy sparing regimen.
 Given UCD affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, we are pursuing designation of KB195 for the potential treatment of a Rare Pediatric Disease, which would eliminate the PDUFA NDA filing fee and provide for additional exclusivity. The FDA defines a “rare pediatric disease” as a serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years.
 We completed two non-IND/non-CTA clinical studies that evaluated the effect of KB195 on microbiome nitrogen metabolism, including one in health volunteers and one in patients with stable UCD. In each study, KB195 was generally well tolerated, with no clinically significant safety signals based on an evaluation of adverse events and response to the Gastrointestinal Tolerability Questionnaire (“GITQ”) or Bristol Stool Scale (“BSS”). The studies assessed gut microbiome ammonia production using the established marker 15N lacto-ureide as a stable isotope tracer and data were suggestive of KB195 activity in reducing this marker of gut microbiome ammonia production. In 2019, a Phase 2 clinical trial of KB195 under an IND and CTAs was initiated and is currently ongoing. This trial will enroll up to 24 patients with inadequately controlled UCD on standard of care for an 8-week treatment period; dose will be escalated from 9 g twice daily, or BID, to 36 g BID and will evaluate plasma ammonia levels, including proportion of patients with ≥15 percent decrease in fasting plasma ammonia as well as safety and tolerability. As clinical sites around the world have dealt with repeated closures due to COVID-19, enrollment for this study has been impacted. We continue to monitor enrollment but are not currently able to estimate when data from this trial will be available.

Hepatic Encephalopathy 
 Disease overview
 HE describes a spectrum of potentially reversible neurologic and psychiatric abnormalities generally observed in patients with liver failure. HE is a common complication of cirrhosis, ranging from minimal hepatic encephalopathy (“MHE”) to overt hepatic encephalopathy (“OHE”). The pathogenesis of HE has long been linked to ammonia levels and is now understood to be multifactorial and includes factors such as intestinal dysbiosis, gut hyperpermeability and neuroinflammation. 
 
Patients with cirrhosis also have an increased risk of developing bacterial infections, and infection is a common precipitant of HE, as well as an independent predictor of mortality in these patients.  In the United States, we estimate that there are approximately 700,000 patients with cirrhosis inclusive of more than 100,000 patients with OHE, and up to 400,000 with MHE, many of whom remain undiagnosed. In Europe, we estimate there are more than 1 million patients with cirrhosis, inclusive of more than 200,000 patients with OHE and up to 600,000 patients with MHE, many of whom have not yet been diagnosed.
 Currently available therapies 
 Medical treatment of HE currently includes treatment of the underlying precipitant, if present, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or infection. There are two approved chronic drug treatments for OHE-lactulose and rifaximin. Although there have been small investigational studies into treatments for MHE, there are currently no approved therapies for MHE.
 Our MMT candidate selection
 We selected KB174 as a candidate for the potential treatment of HE. KB174 was selected based on its ability to reduce ammonia and pathogens ex vivo as well as results from a clinical study of KB174 in patients with well-compensated liver cirrhosis. Forty adult patients with liver disease were enrolled in this double-blind, controlled non-IND/non-CTA clinical study. Patients were randomized to receive KB174 or maltodextrin (a negative control), orally (titrated to 36g BID) for 28 days. Safety and tolerability were assessed using the GITQ and BSS and microbiome ammonia production was measured using the 15 N lacto-ureide as a stable isotope tracer.   
 In this study, patients with well-compensated cirrhosis treated with KB174 had a 26% median reduction from baseline in urinary 15N excretion, a biomarker of microbiome ammonia production, compared to a 3% median reduction from baseline in urinary 15N excretion for patients receiving maltodextrin. KB174 was well tolerated and no clinically significant or serious treatment-related adverse events were observed. 
 Results from a dosing study with KB174 in healthy subjects showed reductions in urinary 15N excretion consistent with the study in patients with cirrhosis and was well tolerated with no clinically significant or serious treatment-related adverse events. 
 Future plans for clinical development in HE
 The focus of the HE program will be to develop a novel therapy that addresses patients at risk for HE, including those with MHE as well as OHE. Initiation of the next clinical study or clinical trial in HE is dependent on identifying a suitable partner for this program. 
 
Infections caused by pathogenic bacteria including multi-drug resistant strains
 Scientific rationale
 Gut commensal bacteria minimize colonization of potential pathogens and maintain the intestinal barrier, thus preventing pathogen translocation to the bloodstream and other organs that ultimately causes infection. A diverse microbiome has been associated with numerous positive health outcomes. The administration of chemotherapy or antibiotics reduces diversity of the microbiome, interfering with its ability to perform these critical protective functions. We believe one potential way to restore the diversity of commensal bacteria is through administration of MMTs that can be metabolized exclusively by commensal bacteria, but not by pathogens. This strategy may therefore increase the diversity and biomass of the commensal microbiota and lead to a reduction in the abundance of pathogens. MMTs thus represent an antibiotic-sparing approach with no known mechanism of resistance for the fight against infectious disease caused by MDR bacteria.

Disease overview
 Multi-drug resistant (“MDR”) pathogens are a significant and growing global health threat. In the United States alone, antibiotic resistant bacteria cause infections in more than 2.8 million people per year, and this number is growing. As antibiotics become less effective for the treatment and prevention of infectious diseases, infections that were once easily managed have become progressively more difficult to treat. Patients who develop MDR infections consume more healthcare resources and have a higher mortality rate than patients infected with non-resistant strains of the same bacteria.
 The risk of MDR pathogen colonization is significantly increased in patients with compromised immune systems, those on long term antibiotics, and those with protracted hospitalizations. Our initial focus is in patients scheduled to undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (“HSCT”), a population at high risk of infection in addition to other pathologies where the microbiome is documented to have an impact (Febrile neutropenia, Graft-versus-host-disease). HSCT is used for the treatment of cancer and certain autoimmune diseases. Bacterial infections are common after HSCT, due to pre-transplant immune system ablation. The use of prophylactic antibiotics was instituted to reduce the rate of such infections; however careful studies of mortality have shown that their use is associated with a significantly increased rate of death. Patients with low microbiome diversity had a significantly greater mortality than those maintaining a high diversity (67% vs 36% mortality at three years). This is thought to be mediated by the adverse effect the antibiotics have on the microbiome. The dysbiotic microbiome in turn facilitates colonization with pathogenic organisms, which may then lead to infection. These infections are a significant cause of patient mortality, excluding mortality due to the primary disease. In the United States, approximately 23,000 patients undergo HSCT each year. 
 Currently available therapies 
 While there are no treatments currently approved for prevention of infections in patients scheduled to receive HSCT, some clinicians treat patients prophylactically with an antibiotic from one of several classes, such as quinolones, beta-lactams or glycopeptides. If a patient develops an infection, they are treated empirically with antibiotics based on the likely organism and site of infection. While a significant number of antibiotics are commercially available, delays in treating an infection with an effective antibiotic is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and some MDR infections have limited or no effective treatment options.
MMT candidates—KB109 and KB174
 KB109 and KB174 are the MMT candidates for development as a potential prevention of infections caused by MDR bacteria. Nomination of these candidates resulted from their performance relative to a wide range of other MMTs in ex vivo screening of microbiome samples from healthy volunteers, as well as microbiome samples from intensive care unit patients in an experimental set-up that specifically focused on determining the potential of MMTs to decrease the relative abundance of a panel of pathogenic bacteria. 
 The initial opportunity is to prevent systemic infections in patients undergoing HSCT. Prophylactic treatment with antibiotics lowers gut microbiome diversity and is associated with a higher mortality rate after HSCT.  KB109 is a non-antibiotic approach that is hypothesized to selectively enhance the growth of beneficial gut bacteria at the expense of pathogens (e.g. carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae, Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae) which may then reduce the risk of subsequent infection. Prior to studying patients undergoing HSCT, we initiated a first-in-human clinical trial in medically stable patients colonized with MDR pathogens but this study was terminated due to enrollment challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the desire to utilize KB109 for our COVID-19 studies. 
 Future pipeline opportunities
 We are currently pursuing a number of opportunities beyond our initial pipeline. Our proprietary product platform is designed to generate the knowledge and insights required to support discovery and development work in a wide range of areas, including where evidence of a link to the microbiome exists but the biology is not yet fully defined. We believe that these areas of more complex microbiome-human biology present an opportunity to leverage our human-centric discovery and development approach and computational expertise.
 17


We have active programs in discovery, including work in immuno-oncology and cardiometabolic and liver diseases. Correlative data has been published for each of these areas suggesting that the microbiome plays a critical role, and our discovery efforts are largely focused on either establishing a mechanistic hypothesis or establishing and optimizing an ex vivo screen to address these opportunities. Some of this work is being conducted through collaborations, including with Institute Gustave Roussy in Paris exploring the potential of MMTs to improve the outcome of immune checkpoint inhibitor (“ICI”) treatment, with Jeffrey Gordon at Washington University (St. Louis) studying the mechanisms by which selected MMT candidates are metabolized by the gut microbiome and the impact on key functions in the host, and with Janssen focusing on decreasing the risk of the development of child-onset atopic diseases, including food allergies. We will advance MMT candidates once identified for future pipeline opportunities.
 Manufacturing
 We have developed proprietary methods for the manufacture of MMT candidates that we believe are scalable and transferable to current good manufacturing practice requirements (“cGMP”). Our MMT candidates are synthesized, purified and isolated using standard small molecule unit operations (such as batch synthesis and column chromatography). The manufacturing process produces bulk MMT candidates suitable for oral administration in a variety of forms, including liquids and spray dried powders in sachets. In addition, we have established robust analytical methods to assess the identity and purity of our MMT candidates. We believe that these controlled manufacturing processes and analytical methods will allow us to produce and release cGMP batches of material with consistent quality.
 Our internal manufacturing capabilities include the production of batches of our MMTs for ex vivo screening and testing, toxicology and human clinical studies. 
 We currently rely on third-party manufacturers for the GMP production of larger quantities of MMT candidates for clinical trials. Our internal personnel have extensive cGMP manufacturing experience in order to ensure efficient technology transfer and to oversee the development and manufacturing activities conducted by third-party manufacturers. 
 While we do not have a current need for commercial scale manufacturing capacity, at the appropriate time we intend to evaluate options for further engaging our existing third-party manufacturers and/or building our own pharmaceutical grade cGMP internal capabilities.
 Intellectual property
 Overview
 We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates and discovery platform. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to pharmaceutical compositions, methods of treatment, methods of manufacture or identified from our ongoing development of our product candidates, as well as discovery based on our proprietary product platform. Our level of success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce any patents that we may obtain, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
 18


The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Consequently, we may not obtain or maintain adequate patent protection for any of our programs and product candidates.

 Patent portfolio
 Our patent portfolio includes patent applications in varying stages of prosecution in the United States and selected jurisdictions outside of the United States. As of March 1, 2021, our patent portfolio in total consisted of twelve issued U.S. patents, two issued European patents, fifteen issued patents in other jurisdictions (Argentina, Australia, Canada, China, Colombia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore and South Africa), and over 100 pending non-provisional applications (U.S., EP and other jurisdictions), which include claims directed to compositions, methods of use and manufacturing processes. All patents are owned by us. Certain patents and patent applications described above are licensed exclusively to Midori USA, Inc. for use in the animal health field.
 The patent portfolio includes patents and applications (numbers for U.S. and Europe only) with claims directed to the following:
 MMT platform
 We own six issued U.S. patents (U.S.10,849,337; 9,205,418; 9,079,171; 8,476,388; and 8,466,242), two issued EP patents (EP 3071235 and EP 2681247), and several pending patent families (with national, non-provisional applications) containing composition of matter, method of making and use claims related to our MMT platform and one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) U.S. provisional, and U.S. non-provisional applications containing claims to KB195, KB174, KB109, and KB295. The issued patents in the earliest of these families are expected to expire in 2032, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions. 
 COVID-19
 We own one provisional application and one pending PCT application containing composition of matter, method of treatment and use claims related to our COVID-19 program and KB109. The issued patents in the earliest of these families are expected to expire in 2038, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions. 
 Ulcerative Colitis
 We own one issued U.S. patent (U.S. 10,881,676), pending national, non-provisional applications and one U.S. provisional application containing composition of matter, method of treatment and use claims related to our ulcerative colitis program and KB295. The issued patents in the earliest of these families are expected to expire in 2036, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions. 
UCD and HE
 We own one issued U.S. patent (U.S. 9,901,595), and several pending national, non-provisional application, and one pending PCT application containing composition of matter, method of treatment and use claims related to our UCD and HE programs and KB195 and KB174. The issued patents in the earliest of these families are expected to expire in 2036, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions. 
 19


We own two issued U.S. patents (U.S. 10,314,853; 9,757,403), one issued EP patent (EP 3071235), and several pending national, non-provisional applications containing method of treatment and use claims related to our pathogen program. The issued patents in the earliest of these families are expected to expire in 2036, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions. 
 
Patent term
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, including the U.S., the base term is 20 years from the filing date of the earliest-filed non-provisional patent application from which the patent claims priority. The term of a U.S. patent can be lengthened by patent term adjustment. In some cases, the term of a U.S. patent is shortened by terminal disclaimer that reduces its term to that of an earlier-expiring patent. The term of a U.S. patent may be eligible for patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. With regard to a drug for which FDA approval is the first permitted marketing of the active ingredient, the Hatch-Waxman Act allows for extension of the term of one U.S. patent that includes at least one claim covering the composition of matter of such an FDA-approved drug, an FDA-approved method of treatment using the drug and/or a method of manufacturing the FDA-approved drug. The extended patent term cannot exceed the shorter of five years beyond the non-extended expiration of the patent or fourteen years from the date of the FDA approval of the drug, and a patent cannot be extended more than once or for more than a single product. During the period of extension, if granted, the scope of exclusivity is limited to the approved product for approved uses. Some foreign jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan, have analogous patent term extension provisions, which allow for extension of the term of a patent that covers a drug approved by the applicable foreign regulatory agency.
 If and when our product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply, if appropriate, for patent term extension on patents directed to those product candidates, their methods of use and/or methods of manufacture. However, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 Trade secrets
 In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We typically rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. 
 Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, strong competition and an emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face substantial competition from many different sources, including larger pharmaceutical companies with more resources. Specialty biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies, as well as public and private institutions are also potential sources of competitive products and technologies. We believe that the key competitive factors affecting the success of any of our product candidates will include efficacy, safety profile, method of administration, cost, level of promotional activity and intellectual property protection.
 20


The field of microbiome drug development is rapidly evolving and although there are currently many bacterial product candidates in development by companies that target the microbiome, we believe that we have a differentiated approach and do not consider ourselves to be in competition with these bacterial microbiome approaches.
 Although our novel chemistry approach is unique from most other existing or investigational therapies across the disease areas where our development is focused, we will need to compete with all currently or imminently available therapies in these areas. We are aware of marketed and investigational products in each of our leading disease areas.
 Government regulation
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval (when required), advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of drugs such as those we are developing as well as dietary non-drug products and foods. We, along with our contract research organizations and contract manufacturers, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical, manufacturing and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval for our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals of drugs for therapeutic indications or commercialization of non-drug products and ensuring subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drug products as well as dietary non-drug products such as foods under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”), its implementing regulations and other laws. At this time none of our MMTs have been approved by the FDA for marketing for therapeutic indications in the United States or been authorized for use as a food or medical food. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during product development, clinical testing, the approval process or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, issuance of clinical holds for ongoing studies, suspension or revocation of approved applications, warning or untitled enforcement letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any FDA enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 We anticipate that the process required by FDA for our MMT candidates to be marketed in the United States as drugs for therapeutic indications will generally involve the following:
  
• | completion of preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice (“GLP”) requirements;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND application;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, GCP requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations, including approval by an IRB or independent ethics committee at each trial site, to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (“NDA”), including payment of user fees and acceptance by the FDA of the NDA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 21


 
• | compliance with ay post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 FDA regulation of food uses
 To date, we have not elected a product candidate to develop and market as a food and may elect never to do so. If we decide to develop one or more of our MMTs as a conventional food product, we will have to follow regulations applicable to food uses.
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities, including the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), regulate the manufacturing, preparation, quality control, import, export, packaging, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, safety, and adverse event reporting of conventional foods. Among other things, manufacturers of conventional foods and medical foods must meet relevant cGMP, and certain requirements that govern the manufacturing, packaging, labeling and holding of foods.
 With certain exceptions, clinical investigations in which an investigational drug is administered to human subjects must be conducted under an IND, as required by FDA regulations. The FDA has published a guidance document for clinical investigators, sponsors, and IRBs, Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) — Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND, that provides the FDA’s thinking on when an IND is required for human research studies. FDA’s interpretation of its regulations, as articulated in this guidance, do not require human testing of food, dietary supplements, or GRAS substances to be conducted under an IND unless such testing is intended to evaluate the product’s ability to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent a disease or condition. FDA specifically recognizes an IND will not be required when a study is designed to “evaluate the tolerability of a food in a specific susceptible population, including individuals with a disease in a diseased population,” provided the study is not designed to evaluate the product’s ability to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent a disease or condition. There is no assurance that FDA’s thinking on this matter will not change, and if it does, FDA may decide to take enforcement action against testing of GRAS substances that it believes should be conducted under an IND, or the FDA may delay or deny an IND submitted with supporting data from human studies not conducted under an IND, or require alternate or additional data to support such an IND before authorizing an applicant to proceed.
 Additionally, depending on the circumstances, the use of a substance in certain clinical investigations may restrict the marketing of such substance in food. Section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act prohibits the marketing of any food to which has been added a drug or biologic for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, unless the substance was marketed in food before any substantial clinical investigations involving the drug or biologic were instituted or one of the other exceptions in section 301(ll) applies. Marketing the substance of interest in food before seeking an IND or beginning any clinical investigations preserves the option to continue to market the substance in those forms after substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and their existence has been made public.
 The FDA may classify some or all of our potential product candidates as containing a food additive that is not GRAS. Such classification would cause these product candidates to require pre-market approval for a food additive regulation, which could substantially delay or prevent the commercialization of these product candidates for non-drug uses. Any delay in the regulatory consultation process, or a determination that any of our drug or food product candidates do not meet regulatory requirements of FDA, including any applicable GRAS requirements, could cause a delay in the commercialization of our product candidates, which may lead to reduced acceptance by the public or others or an inability to commercialize those candidates at all.
 22


FDA regulation of medical food uses
 In parallel with our development of MMT product candidates for therapeutic indications, we are exploring the development of some of our product candidates as medical food products. To date, we have not elected a product candidate to develop and market as a medical food and may elect never to do so.
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities, including the FTC also regulate the manufacturing, preparation, quality control, import, export, packaging, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, safety, and adverse event reporting of medical foods. Among other things, manufacturers of medical foods must meet relevant cGMP and certain requirements that govern the manufacturing, packaging, labeling and holding of foods.
 Preclinical and clinical trials for drugs
 Once a product candidate is identified for development as a drug, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to evaluate the potential for adverse events, which must be conducted in accordance with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP requirements. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data as well as the results of our human clinical studies, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and imposes a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may result in the FDA not allowing clinical trials to commence or not allowing clinical trials to commence on the terms originally specified in the IND. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development, and the FDA must grant permission, either explicitly or implicitly by not objecting before each clinical trial can begin.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human volunteers under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring safety and evaluating effectiveness. Each protocol for our product candidates for therapeutic indications must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IRB for each investigator site proposing to participate in a clinical trial must also review and approve the clinical trial before it can begin at that site. The FDA’s regulations provide additional safeguards for pediatric subjects enrolled in clinical trials of investigational products. For example, under the FDA’s regulations, a clinical investigation involving greater than minimal risk to children but that presents the prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects may involve pediatric subjects only if the IRB finds that the risk is justified by the anticipated benefit to the subjects, the relation of the anticipated benefit to the risk is at least as favorable to the subjects as that presented by available alternative approaches, and adequate provisions are made for soliciting the consent of the pediatric subjects and the permission of their parents and guardians. Further, the IRB must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing of product candidates for therapeutic indications also must satisfy extensive GCP requirements, including requirements for informed consent.
 Human clinical trials for therapeutic indications are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. In certain circumstances, where sufficient evidence of safety and tolerability are collected from preclinical studies and other human experience with a product, such as our human clinical studies, we believe a human clinical trial may begin as late as Phase 3.
  
• | Phase 1 — Phase 1 clinical trials involve initial introduction of the investigational product into healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, excretion the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 — Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 — Phase 3 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 23


 
clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval and physician labeling.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or a Biologics License Application. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, though companies developing orphan products are eligible for certain incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing and waiver of application fees.
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same therapeutic agent for the same indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a subsequent product’s showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the original applicant cannot produce sufficient quantities of product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different therapeutic agents for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same therapeutic agent for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval for the same therapeutic agent for the same indication before we do, unless we are able to demonstrate that our product is clinically superior. Furthermore, if a designated orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than the rare disease or condition for which it received orphan designation, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity.
 Expedited development and review programs for drugs
 The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs and biologics to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life- threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval, and the purpose of these programs is to either expedite the development or review of important new drugs to get them to patients earlier than under standard FDA development and review procedures.
 A new drug or biologic is eligible for Fast Track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast Track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor interactions with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed, meaning that the agency may review portions of the marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application, as well as Priority Review, discussed below. In addition, a new drug or biologic may be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all the features of Fast Track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program beginning as early as Phase 1, and FDA organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate.
 Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible for additional FDA programs intended to expedite the review and approval process, including Priority Review designation and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for Priority Review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. Under Priority Review, FDA must review an application in six months compared to ten months for a standard review. Additionally, products are eligible for accelerated approval if they can be shown to have an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality which 
 24


is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
 Accelerated approval is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. In addition, unless otherwise informed by the FDA, the FDA currently requires, as a condition for accelerated approval, that all advertising and promotional materials that are intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days following marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period, and that after 120 days following marketing approval, all advertising and promotional materials must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination or publication.
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or review process.
 U.S. marketing approval for drugs
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing of our product candidates for drug uses, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. An NDA is a request for approval to market a new drug for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of the drug’s safety and efficacy. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be marketed in the United States. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. An Agreed Initial Pediatric Study Plan requesting a waiver from the requirement to conduct clinical studies has been submitted to the FDA.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are compliant with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the Sponsor product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and other requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA.
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including any inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 Even if the FDA approves a product, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a 
 25


REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 U.S. post-approval requirements for drugs
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. There is also a continuing, annual prescription drug product program user fee.
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-market testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and their subcontractors involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our contract manufacturers. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
 Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements for post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other potential consequences up to and including revocation of product approvals.
 Other regulatory matters
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval or commercialization are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the FTC, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments and governmental agencies.
 Other healthcare laws
 Healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In the United States, these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations.
 Current and future healthcare reform legislation
 In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. We expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform 
 26


measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and additional downward pressure on the price that we, or any collaborators, may receive for any approved products.
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) for example, may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. With the current Administration and Congress, there will likely be additional administrative or legislative changes, including modification, repeal, or replacement of all, or certain provisions of, the ACA, which may impact reimbursement for drugs. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent or loosen certain requirements mandated by the ACA. While Congress has not passed repeal legislation, the Tax Reform Act includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (“BBA”), among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” Congress may consider other legislation to repeal and replace elements of the ACA. Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.
 Packaging and distribution in the United States
 If our products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
 Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
 Other U.S. environmental, health and safety laws and regulations
 We may be subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.
 We maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us.
 In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.

Government regulation of drugs outside of the United States
 To market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization or identification of an alternate regulatory pathway, manufacturing, commercial sales and distribution of our products. For instance, in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) medicinal products must be authorized for marketing by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.
  
• | Centralized procedure — If pursuing marketing authorization of a product candidate for a therapeutic indication under the centralized procedure, following the opining of the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”), the European Commission issues a single marketing authorization valid across the EEA. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines derived from biotechnology processes or advanced therapy medicinal products (such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue engineered products), products that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, viral diseases, and officially designated orphan medicines. For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned contains a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health in the EEA. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is 150 days, excluding clock stops.

• | National authorization procedures — There are also two other possible routes to authorize products for therapeutic indications in several countries, which are available for products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Decentralized procedure — Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mutual recognition procedure — In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, additional marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP and the related national implementing provisions of the individual EU Member States govern the system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. Under this system, an applicant must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The CTA must be accompanied by, among other documents, an investigational medicinal product dossier (the Common Technical Document) with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2005/28/EC, where relevant the implementing national provisions of the individual EU Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance documents.
 The collection and use of personal health data in the European Union, previously governed by the provisions of the Data Protection Directive, is now governed by the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective on May 25, 2018. While the Data Protection Directive did not apply to organizations based outside the EU, the GDPR has expanded its reach to include any business, regardless of its location, that provides goods or services to residents in the EU. This expansion would incorporate any clinical trial activities in EU member states. The GDPR imposes strict requirements on controllers and processors of personal data, including special protections for “sensitive information” which includes health and genetic information of data subjects residing in the EU. GDPR grants individuals the opportunity to object to the processing of their personal information, allows them to request 
 28


deletion of personal information in certain circumstances, and provides the individual with an express right to seek legal remedies in the event the individual believes his or her rights have been violated. Further, the GDPR imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Union to the United States or other regions that have not been deemed to offer “adequate” privacy protections. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the European Union Member States, which may deviate slightly from the GDPR, may result in fines of up to 4% of global revenues, or €20,000,000, whichever is greater. As a result of the implementation of the GDPR, we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules.
 There is significant uncertainty related to the manner in which data protection authorities will seek to enforce compliance with GDPR. For example, it is not clear if the authorities will conduct random audits of companies doing business in the EU, or if the authorities will wait for complaints to be filed by individuals who claim their rights have been violated. Enforcement uncertainty and the costs associated with ensuring GDPR compliance are onerous and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
 Additionally, should we elect one or more product candidates to develop and market as non-therapeutic dietary non-drug products or food products in foreign countries, such products would also be subject to regulation under various national, local, and international laws that include provision governing, among other things, the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising. These regulations may prevent or delay entry into the market or prevent or delay the introduction, or require the reformulation, of certain of our non-therapeutic product candidates.
 The regulatory environment outside the United States varies and in general is less developed then in the United States, but some exceptions do exist. The regulatory requirements for nutritional non-drug products and food products outside of the United States varies greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Each jurisdiction may have its own regulatory framework regarding nutritional non-drug products and food products. The two leading jurisdictions, the United States and the Europe, currently have and may continue to in the future to have distinctly different regulatory regimes with different rules and requirements nutritional non-drug products and food products, with, for example, the European Union having a stronger process for claims review and preapproval for nutritional products. Regulation in Europe is exercised primarily through the European Union, which regulates the combined market of each of its member states. Other European countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to dietary products.
 We cannot predict how the global regulatory landscape regarding our possible nutritional non-drug products or food products, if any, will evolve and we may incur increased regulatory costs as regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate evolve or change. We cannot predict whether or when any jurisdiction will change its regulations with respect to any of our product candidates.
 Should we utilize third part distributors, compliance with such foreign governmental regulations would generally be the responsibility of such distributors, who may be independent contractors over whom we have limited control.
 Government regulation of food for special medical purpose in the European Union
 The regulatory requirements for foods for special medical purposes (“FSMPs”), in the European Union cover FSMP development and commercialization.
 In the European Union, FSMPs are designed to feed patients who, because of a particular disease, disorder or medical condition, have nutritional needs that cannot be met by consuming standard foodstuffs. European Union Regulation defines ‘ food for special medical purposes ’ as food specially processed or formulated and intended for the dietary management of patients, including infants, to be used under medical supervision; it is intended for the exclusive or partial feeding of patients with a limited, impaired or disturbed capacity to take, digest, absorb, metabolize or excrete ordinary food or certain nutrients contained therein, or metabolites, or with other medically-determined nutrient requirements, whose dietary management cannot be achieved by modification of the normal diet alone.
 Businesses intending to commercialize FSMPs in the European Union are required to register their FSMPs by submitting notifications regarding FSMP use, demonstrating compliance with applicable European Union rules, prior to market commercialization. These notifications to competent authority of each European Union Member State include information appearing on the label, and any other information the competent authority may reasonably request to establish compliance with this Regulation.
 29


The European Commission may decide, by means of implementing acts (a) whether a given food falls within the scope of this Regulation; and (b) to which specific category of food a given food belongs. European Food Safety Authority Guidance provides, among other requirements, that the dossier must include an explanation of the scientific and medical basis on which it has been concluded that the use of the specific food product is necessary or is more practical or safer than the exclusive use of non-FSMP foodstuffs.
 FSMPs can also fall within the scope of the novel food legislation in the European Union. Where an ingredient used in the FSMP to be marketed in the European Union falls within the definition of a ‘novel food ingredient’ prior authorization for use of the ingredient needs to be sought. A “novel” food or food ingredients as food that has not been consumed to a significant degree by humans in the European Union before May 15, 1997 and that falls within one of the ten food categories listed. Novel foods and novel food ingredients can only be authorized if they do not pose a safety risk to human health, their intended use does not mislead the consumer and they do not differ from the food they are intended to replace in such a way that its normal consumption would be nutritionally disadvantageous for the consumer. The authorization procedure is likely to take between 12 and 18 months.
 In accordance with European Union clinical trials directives, before a clinical trial site is allowed to start enrolling patients in a clinical trial, the IRB or (IEC), must provide a positive opinion concerning the study protocol and all study-related materials. The competent authorities of the relevant European Union Member State must also provide their related authorization. Clinical trials involving the investigation of the action of non-medicinal products (e.g. foods, such as many FSMPs), are not covered and are not required to register the clinical trial or to complete a CTA for approval by an European Union Member State.
 Human Capital
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 82 full-time employees, of which 24 have Ph.D. or M.D. degrees and 60 are currently engaged in research and clinical development activities. The remaining employees were engaged in business development, finance, information systems, facilities, human resources, legal functions, or administrative support. We also engage consultants and temporary workers when needed. The majority of our employees were based in Lexington, MA. No employees were represented by labor unions or subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationships with our employees to be very strong.
 
We believe our employees are among the company’s most important assets and are key to achieving our goals and expectations. Our human capital resource priorities and our competitive equity and cash compensation and benefits programs focus on attracting, recruiting, retaining and incentivizing our existing and new employees. We consider our human capital resources strategy to be comprehensive and we foster a strong relationship with and among our employees with ongoing efforts such as employee surveys, training and development programs, social interactions, and other programs. We are committed to employing a diverse workforce and plan to continue to evolve and add to our suite of human capital resources as we grow.
 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and as part of our commitment to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees, we created an internal team focused on implementing policies and practices consistent with US Government, Massachusetts, and industry standard regulation and guidance in response to the public health emergency. Since mid-March 2020, the majority of our employees have been working from home. Additionally, we put appropriate safety measures in place, including implementing occupancy limits, restricting business travel, providing and requiring the use of personal protective equipment, health screening, cleaning and visitor protocols, and, in cases of possible exposure, external COVID-19 testing to access our workplaces.
 
Facilities
 Our corporate headquarters are located in Lexington, Massachusetts, where we currently lease 107,000 square feet of laboratory and office space. The lease expires in February 2029, subject to one option to extend the lease for 10 years. 
 Legal proceedings
 We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings.

KALEIDO BIOSCIENCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
 1. Nature of the Business, Basis of Presentation, and Going Concern  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the “Company”) is a clinical-stage healthcare company that was incorporated in Delaware on January 27, 2015 and has a principal place of business in Lexington, Massachusetts. The Company was formed to use its differentiated, chemistry-driven approach to leverage the potential of the microbiome to treat disease and improve human health.  The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the biotechnology industry, including, but not limited to, successful development of technology, obtaining additional funding, protection of proprietary technology, compliance with government regulations, risks of failure of preclinical studies (including ex vivo assays), clinical studies and clinical trials, the need to obtain marketing approval for its drug candidates and if applicable, its consumer products, fluctuations in operating results, economic pressure impacting therapeutic pricing, dependence on key personnel, risks associated with changes in technologies, development by competitors of technological innovations and the ability to supply sufficient amounts of its Microbiome Metabolic Therapies (“MMTs”) at an acceptable quality level. On March 4, 2019, the Company completed its initial public offering (the "IPO"), pursuant to which it issued and sold 5,000,000 shares of common stock. The aggregate net proceeds received by the Company from the IPO were $69.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, but before deducting offering costs payable by the Company, which totaled $3.8 million. Upon the closing of the IPO, all outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock converted into 18,517,386 shares of common stock.  On June 4, 2020, the Company completed a public offering (the “Offering”), pursuant to which it issued and sold 4,750,000 shares of the common stock. The aggregate net proceeds received by the Company from the Offering were $33.2 million. On July 1, 2020, 185,000 shares were exercised under the Underwriter’s overallotment option for net proceeds of $1.3 million.  On August 4, 2020, the Company entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the “Sales Agreement”) with a sales agent for the sale of up to $50.0 million of the Company’s shares of common stock, from time to time in an at-the-market public offering (the “ATM”). The sales agent is entitled to compensation at a fixed commission rate of 3.0% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the Company’s common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company sold 361,299 shares of its common stock under the ATM which resulted in aggregate net proceeds of $3.4 million after payment of related commissions. As of December 31, 2020, there was $46.5 million available under the ATM. In January and February 2021, the Company has sold 309,656 shares of its common stock under the ATM which resulted in aggregate net proceeds of $4.9 million.   On February 8, 2021, the Company completed a public offering (the “2021 Offering”) including the Underwriters’ overallotment option, pursuant to which the Company issued and sold 6,037,500 shares of common stock for net proceeds of $65.3 million.  During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company incurred net losses of $81.6 million and $86.3 million, respectively, and reported cash used in operations totaling $61.5 million and $75.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $46.2 million. With the net proceeds from the January and February 2021 sale of shares under the ATM and from the 2021 Offering, management believes the Company has sufficient cash and cash equivalents or borrowing capacity to fund operating expenses and capital expenditures into the first quarter of 2022. Based on its recurring losses from operations incurred since inception, expectation of continuing operating losses for the foreseeable future, and need to raise additional capital to finance its future operations, the Company has concluded that there is substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that these consolidated financial statements are issued. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  The Company will require substantial additional capital to fund its research and development and ongoing operating expenses. These capital requirements are expected to be funded through debt and equity offerings as well as possible strategic collaborations with other companies. If the Company is unable to raise additional funds when needed, it may be required to delay, reduce or eliminate its product development or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that the Company would otherwise prefer to develop and market 
 107


 itself. While there can be no assurance the Company will be able to successfully reduce operating expenses or raise additional capital, management believes the historical success in managing cash flows and obtaining capital will continue in the foreseeable future. 
 A novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was first identified in late 2019, and subsequently declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. As a result of the outbreak, many companies have experienced disruptions in their operations and in markets served. The Company has instituted some and may take additional temporary precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to its employees, including implementing a work-at-home policy, providing flexibility for working parents and suspending all business-related travel. The full extent of the future impacts of COVID-19 on our operations, including the timing and ability of the Company to complete certain clinical trials and other efforts to advance the development of our MMTs, is uncertain.
 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to the authoritative United States generally accepted accounting principles as found in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) and Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash includes cash in readily available checking accounts. The Company’s cash deposits on hand at one financial institution often exceed federally insured limits. Cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments maturing within 90 days from the date of purchase. Restricted Cash Restricted cash is cash that is restricted as to withdrawal or use under the terms of certain contractual agreements. The restricted cash consists of cash collateral for secured letters of credit for the security deposit on the Company’s leased laboratory and office facilities. Concentrations of Credit Risk and of Significant Suppliers Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. The Company’s cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020 consisted only of money market funds. The Company does not believe that it is subject to unusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships.
 108


 The Company relies, and expects to continue to rely, on a small number of vendors to manufacture supplies and raw materials for its development programs. These programs could be adversely affected by a significant interruption in these manufacturing services or the availability of raw materials.
 Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Laboratory and office equipment, computer equipment and furniture and fixtures are depreciated over a period of five years, and leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the asset’s estimated useful life or the remaining lease term. Major additions and betterments are capitalized; maintenance and repairs, which do not improve or extend the life of the respective assets, are charged to operating expenses as incurred. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. When such events occur, the Company compares the carrying amounts of the assets to their undiscounted expected future cash flows. If this comparison indicates that there is an impairment, the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value. The Company has not recorded any impairment charges in the periods presented. Segment Information
Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in making decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker is the chief executive officer (“CEO”). The Company and CEO view the Company’s operations and manage its business as one operating segment. Collaboration Revenue
The Company analyzes its collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of ASC Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements (ASC 808), to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards that are dependent on the commercial success of such activities. To the extent the arrangement is within the scope of ASC 808, the Company will assess whether aspects of the arrangement between it and their collaboration partner are within the scope of other accounting literature. If the Company concludes that some or all aspects of the arrangement represent a transaction with a customer, it will account for those aspects of the arrangement within the scope of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the Company applies the five-step model described below. If the Company concludes that some or all aspects of the arrangement are within the scope of ASC 808 and do not represent a transaction with a customer, the Company will recognize its allocation of the shared costs incurred with respect to the jointly conducted activities as a component of the related expense in the period incurred.  The Company recognizes revenue after applying the following five steps:    
1) | Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer, 
2) | Identification of the performance obligations in the contract, including whether they are distinct within the context of the contract
3) | Determination of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration 
4) | Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract 
5) | Recognition of revenue when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied 

   If a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606 at inception, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within such contract, determines which of those goods and services are performance obligations, and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct.  Promised goods and services are considered distinct provided that: (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (that is, the good or service is capable of being distinct) and (ii) 
 109


 the entity’s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (that is, the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract). In assessing whether a promised good or service is distinct, the Company considers factors such as the research, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. The Company also considers the intended benefit of the contract in assessing whether a promised good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. If a promised good or service is not distinct, an entity is required to combine that good or service with other promised goods or services until it identifies a bundle of goods or services that is distinct. 
  The Company may provide options to additional goods or services in such arrangements exercisable at a customer’s discretion. The Company assesses if these options provide a material right to the customer and if so, they are considered performance obligations. The identification of material rights requires judgments related to the determination of the value of the underlying good and services to the option exercise price.    The Company determines transaction price based on the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive for transferring the promised goods or services in the contract. Consideration may be fixed, variable, or a combination of both. The Company then allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling prices (“SSP”). SSP is determined at contract inception and is not updated to reflect changes between contract inception and when the performance obligations are satisfied. In developing the SSP for a performance obligation, the Company considers applicable market conditions and relevant entity-specific factors, including factors that were contemplated in negotiating the agreement with the customer and estimated costs. 
  If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, the Company estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled by using the expected value method or the most likely amount method. The Company includes the unconstrained amount of estimated variable consideration in the transaction price. The amount included in the transaction price is constrained to the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, the Company re-evaluates the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price.   The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied, either at a point in time or over time, and if over time recognition is based on the use of an output or input method.
 Amounts received prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. If the related performance obligation is expected to be satisfied within the next twelve months this will be classified in current liabilities. Amounts recognized as revenue prior to receipt are recorded as other current assets in the Company's balance sheets. If the Company expects to have an unconditional right to receive the consideration in the next twelve months, this will be classified in other current assets.
   Research and Development Costs Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred in performing research and development activities, including salaries and bonuses, stock‑based compensation, employee benefits, facilities costs, laboratory supplies, depreciation, manufacturing expenses and external costs of vendors engaged to conduct preclinical development activities and clinical trials, as well as the cost of licensing technology. Upfront payments and milestone payments made for the licensing of technology are expensed as research and development in the period in which they are incurred. Advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed. Research and Manufacturing Contract Costs and Accruals The Company has entered into various research and development and manufacturing contracts. These agreements are generally cancelable, and related payments are recorded as the corresponding expenses are incurred. The Company records accruals for estimated ongoing costs. When evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liabilities, the 
 110


 Company analyzes progress of the research studies or clinical trials and manufacturing activities, including the phase or completion of events, invoices received and contracted costs. Significant judgments and estimates may be required in determining the accrued balances at the end of any reporting period. Actual results could differ from the Company’s estimates. The Company’s historical accrual estimates have not been materially different from the actual costs.
 Patent Costs All patent‑related costs incurred in connection with filing and prosecuting patent applications are expensed as incurred due to the uncertainty about the recovery of the expenditure. Amounts incurred are classified as general and administrative expenses. Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount, which, more likely than not, will be realized. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from any uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Fair Value Measurements  Certain assets and liabilities are carried at fair value. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three levels of the fair value hierarchy, of which the first two are considered observable and the last is considered unobservable:  
• | Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date for identical assets and liabilities.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs include the following:
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | observable inputs other than quoted prices that are used in the valuation of the asset or liabilities (e.g., interest rate and yield curve quotes at commonly quoted intervals)
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Level 3 – Unobservable inputs for the assets or liability (i.e., supported by little or no market activity). Level 3 inputs include management’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability (including assumptions about risk). The carrying amount of the Company’s other financial assets and liabilities including cash, accounts payable and long-term debt approximate fair value because of the relatively short period of time between origination and expected realization or settlement.

 Net Loss Per Share Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted net loss is computed by adjusting net loss to reallocate undistributed earnings based on the potential impact of dilutive securities. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the diluted net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period, including potential dilutive common shares assuming the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents. The following table presents securities that have been excluded from the computations of diluted weighted-average shares outstanding as they would be anti-dilutive due to the net losses:     
 | As of December 31, | 
---------------------------------+--------------------+----------
 | 2020 | | 2019
Options to purchase common stock | | 6,978,447 | | 7,235,581
Unvested restricted stock units | | 316,249 | | 50,000 
Unvested restricted common stock | | — | | 1,250 
 | | 7,294,696 | | 7,286,831

   Stock-Based Compensation
For stock-based awards, the Company measures the estimated fair value of the stock-based award on the date of grant and recognizes compensation expense for those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. For stock-based awards with service-based vesting conditions, the Company records the expense for these awards using the straight-line method.  For stock options with performance-based vesting conditions, the Company records the expense for these awards over the requisite service period using an accelerated attribution method to the extent the achievement of the performance condition is probable. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.   The Company classifies stock-based compensation expense in its consolidated statements of operations in the same manner in which the award recipient’s cash compensation costs are classified. Comprehensive Loss
Comprehensive loss includes net loss as well as other changes in stockholders’ equity that result from transactions and economic events other than those with stockholders. The Company’s comprehensive net loss equals the reported net loss for all periods presented. Subsequent events The Company evaluates events and/or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date and before the issue date of the financial statements to determine if any of those events and/or transactions require adjustment to or disclosure in the financial statements. Accounting Pronouncements Issued and Not Adopted In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (“ASU 2016-02”), which applies to all leases and will require lessees to record most leases on the balance sheet but recognize expense in a manner similar to the current standard. The Company will use a modified retrospective approach of adoption for leases. As an emerging growth company, the Company expects to delay adoption until January 1, 2022 and is evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements. The Company expects to recognize a significant lease obligation and right to use asset upon adoption.

 3. Fair Value Measurements
 The following tables set forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands):    
 | Fair Value Measurement as of December 31, 2020
----------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------
 | Level 1 | | Level 2 | Level 3 | Total | 
Assets: | | | | | | | | 
Money market funds included within cash and cash equivalents | $ | 45,410 | | — | | — | $ | 45,410
Total | $ | 45,410 | | — | | — | $ | 45,410


 | Fair Value Measurement as of December 31, 2019

Assets: | | | | | 
Money market funds included within cash and cash equivalents | $ | 25,304 | | — | —
Total | $ | 25,304 | | — | —

   The fair value of money market funds was measured by the Company based on quoted market prices. There were no transfers among Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 categories in the periods presented. Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value The carrying value of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses that are reported on the consolidated balance sheets approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. The carrying value of the long-term debt approximates fair value as evidenced by the recent refinancings.
 4. Property and Equipment, net  Property and equipment consist of the following (in thousands):    
 | As of December 31, | 
-----------------------------------------------+--------------------+-------
 | 2020 | | | 2019 | 
Laboratory equipment | $ | 6,843 | | | $ | 4,526 | 
Office and computer equipment | | 1,590 | | | | 1,418 | 
Leasehold improvements | | 1,910 | | | | 687 | 
Construction in process | | 1,612 | | | | 2,650 |

Less accumulated depreciation and amortization | | (3,493 | ) | | | (2,539 | )
Property and equipment – net | $ | 8,462 | | | $ | 6,742 | 

   Depreciation and amortization expense was $1.8 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded gross fixed asset disposal of $1.1 million and related accumulated depreciation of $0.9 million.  There were no disposals for the year ended December 31, 2019.

 6. Debt Financing
2019 Credit Facility In December 2019, the Company repaid all borrowings under the 2019 Credit Facility. The aggregate principal amount of the loan outstanding at the time of repayment was $15.0 million. The Company also paid the prepayment fee of 2% totaling $0.3 million.  The Company recognized a loss on the extinguishment of the 2019 Credit Facility of $0.4 million related to the unamortized debt discount and prepayment fee at the time of repayment.  2019 Credit Agreement On December 31, 2019, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Hercules Capital, Inc. (the “Lender”). Under the Credit Agreement, the Company borrowed $22.5 million, and the Company has the option to draw down an additional $12.5 million if certain milestones and conditions are met. The Company incurred fees of $0.3 million, which was paid to the lender on the closing date. These amounts were recorded as a debt discount and are being amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also includes an end of term charge equal to 7.55% of the aggregate principal amount of all advances. The end of term charge, totaling $1.7 million at December 31, 2019, was recognized as a debt discount and is reflected as a reduction in the carrying value of the debt and recorded in other long-term liabilities. The debt discount created by the end of term charge is being accreted and will be recognized as additional interest expense over the term of the Credit Agreement using the effective interest method.
   The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, events of default and affirmative and negative covenants, including, among others, covenants that limit or restrict the Company’s ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, merge or consolidate, make acquisitions, pay dividends or other distributions or repurchase equity, make investments, dispose of assets and enter into certain transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to certain exceptions. As security for its obligations under the Credit Agreement, the Company granted the Lender a first priority security interest on substantially all of the Company’s assets (other than intellectual property), and subject to certain exceptions.  The outstanding principal under the Credit Agreement has a 48-month term with interest only payments for the first 15 months, which period can be extended to up to 24 months, depending on the achievement of certain performance milestones. The principal bears an interest rate of equal to the greater of (i) 8.95% plus the prime rate minus 4.75% and (ii) 8.95%. The Credit Agreement includes mandatory prepayment provisions that require prepayment upon the occurrence of a change in control event.

 On June 15, 2020, the Company entered into a Second Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement (the “Amendment”). The Amendment was entered into for the primary purpose of amending the Credit Agreement as follows: (i) the second tranche of the term loan (the “Term Loan”) is terminated; (ii) amounts available under Tranche 3 of the Term Loan is increased to $12.5 million from the previous $7.5 million availability amount and its availability period is extended through December 15, 2021, subject to future approval by the Agent’s investment committee; (iii) the interest-only period is extended through July 31, 2021; (iv) the interest rate on borrowings is increased by 0.4%, such that the per annum interest rate on outstanding borrowings will be the greater of (a) 9.35% and (b) 9.35% plus the Wall Street Journal prime rate minus 3.25%; (v) the variable amount and duration of a minimum cash covenant in the Agreement are amended. The interest rate at December 31, 2020 is 9.35%. The Amendment has been accounted for as a modification and the Company incurred fees of $79,000, which was paid to the lender on the closing date and were recorded as a debt discount, which will be amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method.   Future principal payments under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2020 are as follows (in thousands):

   8. Stockholders’ Equity  Stock-based compensation 2015 Stock Incentive Plan  The Company’s 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2015 Plan”) provided for the Company to sell or issue incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, and other equity awards to employees, directors and consultants of the Company.  The 2019 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”) became effective in February 27, 2019. Upon effectiveness of the 2019 Plan, the remaining shares available under the 2015 Plan ceased to be available for issuance and no future issuances will be made under the 2015 Plan. 
 115


 The 2019 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, restricted stock awards, unrestricted stock awards, cash-based awards and dividend equivalent rights to the Company’s officers, employees, directors and consultants. Awards generally vest over a period up to 4 years and have a maximum term of 10 years. The number of shares initially reserved for issuance under the 2019 Plan is 2,168,976, has increased on January 1, 2020 and will continue to increase each January 1 thereafter by 4% of the number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31 or such lesser number of shares determined by the Company’s board of directors or compensation committee of the board of directors. There were 2,923,603 shares available for future issuance at December 31, 2020. 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan The 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2019 ESPP”) became effective on February 27, 2019. A total of 180,748 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under this plan. In addition, the number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the ESPP automatically increased on January 1, 2020, and will continue to increase each January 1 thereafter, by the lesser of (i) 542,244 shares of common stock, (ii) 1% of the number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31 or (iii) such lesser number of shares as determined by the administrator of the 2019 ESPP. No shares were issued under the 2019 ESPP in 2019. There were 482,025 shares available for future issuance at December 31, 2020. Stock Option Valuation The fair value of stock option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company historically has been a private company and lacks company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, it estimates its expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of a publicly traded set of peer companies and expects to continue to do so until such time as it has adequate historical data regarding the volatility of its own traded stock price. For options with service-based vesting conditions, the expected term of the Company’s stock options has been determined utilizing the “simplified” method for awards that qualify as “plain-vanilla” options. The expected term of stock options granted to non-employees is equal to the contractual term of the option award. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.   The Company typically grants stock options at exercise prices deemed by the Board to be equal to the fair value of the common stock at the time of grant. In the periods prior to the IPO, the fair value of the common stock has been determined by the Board at each measurement date based on a variety of different factors, including the results obtained from independent third-party appraisals, the Company’s financial position and historical financial performance, the status of development of the Company’s programs, the current climate in the marketplace, the illiquid nature of the common stock, the effect of the rights and preferences of the preferred stockholders, and the prospects of a liquidity event, among others.  In the periods following the IPO, the fair value is determined based upon the quoted price of the Company’s common stock. The assumptions that the Company used to determine the grant-date fair value of options granted were as follows:    
 | Years Ended December 31, | 
-------------------------+--------------------------+--
 | 2020 | | | 2019 
Expected volatility | 83.5% - 105.5% | | | 66.1% - 84% 
Risk-free interest rate | 0.15% - 1.41% | | | 1.42% - 2.54%
Expected term (in years) | 1.39-6.32 | | | 5.50-6.25 
Expected dividend yield | | — | % | | — | %

   On July 20, 2020, the Company entered into an amendment to the employment agreement with the former CEO, which amended an existing employment agreement and provided for changes in the term of service and compensation under the agreement. The outstanding options and restricted stock units held by the former CEO were modified to accelerate certain vesting provisions and extended the period of exercisability. As a result, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $1.9 million related to the incremental fair value of the modified awards during the third quarter of 2020.

 9. Income Taxes There is no provision for income taxes because the Company has historically incurred net operating losses and maintains a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.  Significant components of the Company’s net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:    
 | Years ended December 31, | 
--------------------------------------+--------------------------+--------

   A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the Company’s effective income tax rate is as follows:    
 | Years ended December 31, | 
---------------------------------------------+--------------------------+------
 | 2020 | | | 2019
Federal income tax expense at statutory rate | | 21.0 | % | | 21.0 | %

   As of December 31, 2020, the Company had net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards for U.S. federal and state tax purposes of $238.5 million and $235 million, respectively. Federal NOLs of $38.8 million, generated before 2018, will begin expiring in varying amounts in 2035 unless utilized and the remaining NOL of $199.7 million, generated after 2018 will be carried forward indefinitely and could be used up to 80% of taxable income of each future tax year. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts does not follow federal on NOL carryforwards and as such the Company’s Massachusetts NOLs of $235 million will expire in at various times starting in 2035. As of December 31, 2020, the Company also has federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of 
 118


 approximately $5.5 million, and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $3.2 million, which may be available to reduce future tax liabilities, and which expire at various dates through 2040.
 Management of the Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its deferred tax assets, which are comprised principally of net operating loss carryforwards research and development tax credit carryforwards and capitalized expenditures. Under the applicable accounting standards, management has considered the Company’s history of cumulative net losses incurred since inception and its lack of commercialization of any products or generation of any revenue from product sales since inception and concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will not recognize the benefits of its federal and state deferred tax assets.  Accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been established, and the valuation allowance increased $22.8 million and $26.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Utilization of the net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation under Section 382 of the Code due to ownership change limitations that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. These ownership changes may limit the amount of net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. The Company has not completed a study to assess whether a change of ownership has occurred, or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since its formation, due to the significant cost and complexity associated with a study. There could also be additional ownership changes in the future which may result in additional limitations on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. The Company files tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by federal and state jurisdictions, where applicable. There are currently no pending tax examinations. Since the Company is in a loss carryforward position, it is generally subject to examination by the U.S. federal, state, and local income tax authorities for all tax years in which a loss carryforward is available. The Company’s policy is to record estimated interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. The Company has no amounts recorded for any unrecognized tax positions, accrued interest or penalties as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
 
 10. Revenue   In December 2019, the Company entered into a research collaboration agreement with Janssen’s World Without Disease Accelerator (“Janssen”), part of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, to explore the potential for a MMT to prevent the onset of childhood allergy and other atopic, immune and metabolic conditions. The collaboration includes three milestones of research and development with results of those efforts due to Janssen at end of the milestone at which point Janssen will have 60 days to decide to proceed with the next milestone. The Company assessed the Janssen collaboration agreement in accordance with ASC 808 and ASC 606 and concluded that the arrangement represents a contract with a customer and is within the scope of ASC 606. The promised goods and services represent one combined performance obligation and the entire transaction price will be allocated to that single combined performance obligation. In addition, the Company concluded the right to proceed with the following milestones does not provide any discounts to Janssen if it decides to proceed with the next milestones. As such, the Company concluded the milestone is not considered to be a material right. Each milestone is considered a separate contract and reflects applicable standalone selling prices. Under the Janssen collaboration agreement, Janssen is obligated to reimburse the Company for the costs incurred under an agreed upon research plan. Costs incurred are billed by the Company to Janssen at completion of each milestone. The Company recognizes revenue over the research period and as the performance obligation is satisfied. using total estimated hours to be incurred throughout each milestone. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized $1.0 million as collaboration revenue under the agreement. Further, as of December 31, 2020, 
 119


 the Company recorded $498 as deferred revenue within other current liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets related to the Janssen collaboration agreement. The expected research term of this arrangement is expected to be completed during 2021, and the aggregate consideration is not expected to be material.
