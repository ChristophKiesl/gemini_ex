ITEM 1. BUSINESSOverview
 
MassRoots, Inc. was formed in April 2013 as a technology platform for the cannabis industry. In March 2021, we relaunched our website, MassRoots.com, which aims to enable cannabis consumers to find the best products, connect with other enthusiasts, and deliver fresh content that both delights and informs our audience. Additionally, we plan to monetize our YouTube Channel, which has 273,000 subscribers, through product placements and sponsorships. Management believes that our YouTube Channel has one of the largest followings in the regulated cannabis industry while our Instagram account is followed by 378,000 users.
Background
 
We were incorporated in the state of Delaware on April 26, 2013 as a technology platform for the cannabis industry.
 
Our principal executive office is located at 1560 Broadway, Office 17-105, Denver, Colorado 80202, and our telephone number is (720) 240-9546.
 
On January 25, 2017, we consummated a reverse triangular merger (the “Whaxy Merger”) pursuant to which we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of DDDigtal Inc (“DDDigtal”), a Colorado corporation. Upon closing of the Whaxy Merger, each share of DDDigtal’s common stock was exchanged for such number of shares of our common stock (or a fraction thereof) based on an exchange ratio equal to approximately 5.273-for-1, such that 1 share of our common stock was issued for every 5.273 shares of DDDigtal’s common stock. At the closing of the Whaxy Merger, all shares of common stock of our newly-formed merger subsidiary formed for the sole purpose of effectuating the Whaxy Merger, were converted into and exchanged for one share of common stock of DDDigtal, and all shares of DDDigtal’s common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Whaxy Merger were automatically cancelled and retired. Upon the closing of the Whaxy Merger, DDDigtal continued as our surviving wholly-owned subsidiary, and the merger subsidiary ceased to exist.
 
On July 13, 2017, we consummated a reverse triangular merger (the “Odava Merger”) pursuant to which we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Odava Inc (“Odava”), a Delaware corporation. Upon closing of the Odava Merger, each share of Odava’s common stock was exchanged for such number of shares of our common stock (or a fraction thereof), based on an exchange ratio equal to approximately 4.069-for-1, such that 1 share of our common stock was issued for every 4.069 shares of Odava’s common stock. At the closing of the Odava Merger, all shares of common stock of our newly-formed merger subsidiary formed for the sole purpose of effectuating the Odava Merger, were converted into and exchanged for one share of common stock of Odava, and all shares of Odava’s common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Odava Merger automatically cancelled and retired. Upon the closing of the Odava Merger, Odava continued as our surviving wholly-owned subsidiary, and the merger subsidiary ceased to exist.

Blockchain Technologies
 
MassRoots Blockchain Technologies, Inc. (“MassRoots Blockchain”) was formed in December 2017 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company to continue the Company’s efforts in exploring how new technologies may be utilized in the cannabis industry. Initially, we are focusing on blockchain technology for several reasons, including, but not limited to:

● | that it may enable better tracking of impressions, views, and interactions with posts, advertisements and dispensary listings;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | that it has the potential to streamline the collection and organization of data while eliminating traditional security risks;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | that it may provide a greater degree of reliability and accuracy with respect to data;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | that it may allow us to implement an intelligent newsfeed to deliver high-quality and more relevant content to our audience;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | that it may enable the development of contracts that are automatically executed when certain parameters are met;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | that it has the potential to reduce friction in the cannabis market-place and save businesses valuable resources; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | that it may provide greater transparency to government regulators.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In December 2017, we commenced the re-development of the MassRoots Business Portal, a platform where dispensaries and other industry participants, such as producers and other ancillary businesses, will be able to advertise their goods and services. To date, we have used approximately $370,000 for the initial development of the MassRoots Business Portal, including features that allow for tracking of advertising impressions, enhanced targeting and serving of advertisements, as well as a program that would be designed to reward audience for providing high quality reviews on cannabis strains and products. The development and implementation of these any other features, including the possible use of digital instruments, is subject to additional funding, is currently contemplated to be made within the MassRoots App and platform, and is intended to generate the growth of Users of the MassRoots platform and stimulate the MassRoots platform’s overall activity.
 
All initial development has been outsourced to third party development firms and consultants. Specifically, we have outsourced the following services: software development services, including, but not limited to, web and mobile development services, blockchain development and integration services, and infrastructure development, automation, support and management services. As stated in “Risk Factors,” the development of features based upon the use of blockchain technology is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance as to when, or if, any such features will be successfully developed, or that if developed, that they will be accepted or adopted. Further, the likelihood of our development and implementation of features based upon new technology must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with the inception and development of a product or service based upon any such relatively new and developing technology.
 
While we intend to devote resources to exploring the feasibility of developing these or other solutions, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in implementing such solutions, that any such solutions will be economically viable, or that any of them will result in the generation of User interest, participation or revenue.
 
We currently anticipate that we will need to raise additional funds to continue to explore and develop potential uses and applications of blockchain technologies and uses for our business and other businesses in the cannabis industry; however, no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.

Market Conditions
 
MassRoots is poised to take advantage of two rapidly growing industries: cannabis and mobile technology.
 
Cannabis Market Growth and Current Trends
 
On January 4, 2018, Attorney General Jefferson B. Sessions, III issued a memo which rescinded the Cole Memo (as described below) which was adopted by the Obama administration as a policy of non-interference with marijuana-friendly state laws.
The Cole Memo
 
On August 29, 2013, Deputy Attorney General James Cole issued a memo (the “Cole Memo”) in response to certain states passing measures to regulate the medical and adult-use of cannabis. In the Cole Memo, the Department of Justice made clear that marijuana remains an illegal drug under the Controlled Substances Act and that federal prosecutors will continue to aggressively enforce the statute. The Department of Justice identified eight enforcement areas that federal prosecutors should prioritize. Outside of such enforcement priorities, the federal government has traditionally relied on state and local authorities to address marijuana activity. The Cole Memo established several basic guidelines by which state-regulated cannabis businesses could operate to minimize the risk of intervention and enforcement by the Department of Justice. The guidelines focused on ensuring that cannabis did not cross state lines, keeping dispensaries away from schools and public facilities and strict-enforcement of state laws by regulatory agencies, among other priorities.
The Sessions Memo
 
On January 4, 2018, Attorney General Jefferson B. Sessions, III issued a memo (the “Sessions Memo”) on federal marijuana enforcement policy announcing a return to the rule of law and the rescission of previous nationwide guidance by the Department of Justice (including, but not limited to, the Cole Memo). In the memorandum, Attorney General Jefferson Sessions directs all U.S. attorneys to enforce the laws enacted by Congress and to follow the well-established principles when pursuing prosecutions related to marijuana activities. These principles include weighing all relevant considerations, including federal law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General, the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community.
 
Although the Sessions Memo rescinded the Cole Memo, it is unclear at this time whether the Biden Administration will strongly enforce the federal laws applicable to cannabis or what types of activities will be targeted for enforcement; however, a significant change in the federal government’s enforcement policy with respect to current federal laws applicable to cannabis could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Guidance to Banks Relating to the Marijuana Industry
 
On February 14, 2014, the Department of Justice and the Department of Treasury issued guidance to banks about how to serve the marijuana industry without running afoul of federal regulations. Prior to such guidance, dispensaries were forced to operate on a cash basis, presenting significant security and accounting issues. Although banks have remained reluctant to work with marijuana businesses because of federal prohibition laws, this guidance was a major step in legitimizing and accepting the cannabis industry on a national level. In addition, the adoption of the Joyce Amendment (formerly known as the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment) (as discussed below) indicates some level of support in Congress for medicinal cannabis, even if its actual effect is still undetermined.
 
For additional information concerning the Cole Memo, the Sessions Member, the Joyce Amendment and regulatory conditions, see the section entitled “Business – Government Regulation.”

Current States with Laws Permitting the Medical or Adult Use of Cannabis

Recreational marijuana is regulated in 15 states and the District of Columbia and medical marijuana is regulated in 33 states and the District of Columbia. In addition, 15 additional states have legalized low-tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”)/high-cannabidiol (“CBD”) extracts for select medical conditions. The states which have enacted such laws are listed in the following table:

Public Support for Regulation of Cannabis Increasing
 
A Gallup poll conducted in October 2019 found that 66% of Americans supported regulating the use of cannabis which indicates an increasing trend over the past decade toward public support for cannabis.

Market Conditions that Could Limit Our Business
 
Cannabis is a Schedule I controlled substance under Federal law and, as such, there are several factors that could limit our business operations including, but not limited to:

● | The Federal government and many private employers prohibit drug use of any kind, including cannabis, even where it is permissible under state law. Random drug screenings and potential enforcement of such employment provisions may significantly reduce the size of the potential cannabis market;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enforcement of Federal law prohibiting cannabis occurs randomly and often without notice. This could scare many potential investors away from cannabis-related investments and makes it difficult to make accurate market predictions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On January 4, 2018, the Department of Justice issued the Sessions Memo announcing a return to the rule of law and the rescission of previous guidance documents. The Sessions Memo rescinded the Cole Memo. Although there is no guarantee that additional states will pass measures to regulate cannabis use under state law, the Sessions Memo may further deter states from passing such measures; however, it is unclear at this time whether the the Biden administration will issued new guidance or strongly enforce the federal laws applicable to cannabis or what types of activities will be targeted for enforcement. Furthermore, irrespective of the Sessions Memo, in many states, public support of regulation initiatives may not maintain enough support to pass. This is especially true when a supermajority is needed to pass measures, like in Florida where a state constitutional amendment permitting medical cannabis required 60% approval to pass. Changes due to the Sessions Memo and in voters’ attitudes and turnout have the potential to slow or stop the cannabis regulation movement and potentially reverse recent cannabis regulation victories;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | There has been some resistance and negativity as a result of recent cannabis regulation at the state level, especially as it relates to drugged driving. The lack of clearly defined and enforced laws at the state level has the potential to sway public opinion against marijuana regulation; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In the event that the Federal government does not enforce the Federal law prohibiting cannabis, state laws regarding the regulation of cannabis are being challenged through lawsuits. Lawsuits have been brought by private groups and local law enforcement officials. If these lawsuits are successful, state laws permitting cannabis sales may be overturned which will significantly reduce the size of the potential cannabis market and have a material adverse effect on our business.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Please see “Government Regulation” below for additional information.
 
Government Regulation
 
Marijuana is a categorized as a Schedule I controlled substance by the Drug Enforcement Agency and the United States Department of Justice and is illegal to grow, possess and consume under Federal law. However, 33 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws that permit doctors to recommend cannabis for medical-use and 11 of those states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws that regulate the personal-use of cannabis by adults, subject to possession limits. Because doctors are prohibited from prescribing a Schedule I controlled substance, the passage of medical marijuana laws does not necessarily guarantee the implementation of a regulated, commercial system through which patients can purchase cannabis products. This has created an unpredictable business-environment for dispensaries and collectives that operate under certain state laws but in violation of Federal law.
Cole Memo
 
On August 29, 2013, United States Deputy Attorney General James Cole issued the Cole Memo to United States attorneys guiding them to prioritize enforcement of Federal law away from the cannabis industry operating as permitted under certain state laws, so long as:

● | cannabis is not being distributed to minors and dispensaries are not located around schools and public buildings;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the proceeds from sales are not going to gangs, cartels or criminal enterprises;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
5

 


● | cannabis grown in states where it is legal is not being diverted to other states;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cannabis-related businesses are not being used as a cover for sales of other illegal drugs or illegal activity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | there is not any violence or use of firearms in the cultivation and sale of marijuana;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | there is strict enforcement of drugged-driving laws and adequate prevention of adverse health consequences; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cannabis is not grown, used, or possessed on Federal properties.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Cole Memo was a guide for United States attorneys and did not alter in any way the Department of Justice’s authority to enforce Federal law, including Federal laws relating to cannabis, regardless of state law. As described below, as a result of the issuance of the Sessions Memo by the Department of Justice, on January 4, 2018, the Cole memo was rescinded. Prior to the issuance of the Sessions Memo, we had implemented standard operating procedures and policies to ensure that we were operating in compliance with the Cole Memo. It is unclear at this time whether the Biden administration will issue new guidance or strongly enforce the federal laws applicable to cannabis or what types of activities will be targeted for enforcement, and we cannot provide assurance that our actions were, are or will be in compliance with the Cole Memo, the Sessions Memo or any other laws or regulations that currently exist or may be amended or adopted in the future.
 
Pursuant to our currently existing Terms and Conditions:
 

● | Users must agree that they are located in a state where medical-use or adult-use of cannabis is regulated;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Users must be of age to consume cannabis in their particular state (18 or 21 years old, depending on the state);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Users may only post content that is in compliance with their state’s laws;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Users may not solicit or distribute cannabis through MassRoots unless they are a licensed dispensary;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Posting of any of the following materials to MassRoots is prohibited and will result in account termination:
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Posting other drugs or substances, including prescription pain pills;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Posting of any violence or threat of violence;
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | Posting of any drugged-driving content; and
--+--------------------------------------------


● | Posting of any copyright-protected content.
--+--------------------------------------------

 
We have implemented an aggressive content and account review program to ensure compliance with our Terms and Conditions. Users have the ability to report any status or account that is in violation of our Terms and Conditions and we encourage Users to do so as any illegal content jeopardizes the network for all our Users. When a status or account is reported, the post is automatically removed from the network until further review. A MassRoots employee then reviews the content within 24 hours and either approves it as in compliance within our Terms and Conditions or permanently deletes it and bans the User’s account.
 
In addition, we have implemented geographic restrictions to restrict new Users to our mobile apps to the District of Columbia and the 33 states in which the use of marijuana is permitted.
 
Our business plan includes allowing cannabis dispensaries to advertise on our network, which we believe could be deemed to be aiding and abetting illegal activities, a violation of Federal law. We continue to evaluate the effects of the Sessions Memo; however, it is unclear at this time whether the Biden administration will issue new guidance or will strongly enforce the federal laws applicable to cannabis or what types of activities will be targeted for enforcement, and we cannot provide assurance that we were, are or will be in compliance with the Cole Memo, the Sessions Memo or any other laws or regulations.
 
Joyce Amendment (formerly known as the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment)
 
On December 16, 2014, H.R. 83 - Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 was enacted and included a provision now known as the “Joyce Amendment” which states:
 
None of the funds made available in this Act to the Department of Justice may be used, with respect to the States of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin, to prevent such states from implementing their own state laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana.

The Joyce Amendment would appear to protect the right of the states to determine their own laws on medical cannabis use; however, the actual effects of the amendment are still unclear. The Joyce Amendment did not remove the federal ban on medical cannabis and cannabis remains regulated as a Schedule I controlled substance. Further, the United States Department of Justice has interpreted the Joyce Amendment as only preventing federal action that prevents states from creating and implementing cannabis laws - not against the individuals or businesses that actually carry out cannabis laws – and has continued to sporadically initiate enforcement actions against individuals or businesses participating in the cannabis industry despite such participation being regulated under state law. As of April 2020, the United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, has held in support of the Joyce Amendment and stated on at least one occasion that United States Department of Justice was prohibited from spending federal appropriations funds for prosecuting individuals engaged in conduct permitted by state law. In addition, no matter what the interpretation is adopted by the courts, there is no question that the Joyce Amendment does not protect any party not in full compliance with state medicinal cannabis laws.
 
The Joyce Amendment represents one of the first times in recent history that Congress has taken action indicating support of medical cannabis. The Joyce Amendment was renewed by Congress in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and is in effect until September 30, 2021.
 
Sessions Memo
 
On January 4, 2018, Attorney General Jefferson B. Sessions, III issued a memo on federal marijuana enforcement policy announcing a return to the rule of law and the rescission of previous nationwide guidance by the Department of Justice (including, but not limited to, the Cole Memo). In the memorandum, Attorney General Jefferson Sessions directs all U.S. attorneys to enforce the laws enacted by Congress and to follow well-established principles when pursuing prosecutions related to marijuana activities. These principles include weighing all relevant considerations, including federal law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General, the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community. The effect of this memo is to shift federal policy from a hands-off approach adopted by the Obama administration to permitting federal prosecutors across the country to determine how to prioritize resources to regulate marijuana possession, distribution and cultivation in states where marijuana use is legal.
 
While we do not directly harvest or distribute cannabis today, we still may be deemed to be violating federal law, or aiding and abetting the violation of Federal law and may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement by the federal or state governments.
 
Although the Sessions Memo rescinded the Cole Memo, it is unclear at this time whether the Biden administration will issue new guidance or will strongly enforce the federal laws applicable to cannabis or what types of activities will be targeted for enforcement; however, a significant change in the federal government’s enforcement policy with respect to current federal laws applicable to cannabis could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
Additional Government Regulations
 
We are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as Federal and state regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet and e-commerce. These regulations and laws cover among others, sweepstakes, taxation, tariffs, user privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, broadband residential Internet access and the characteristics and quality of services. Any noncompliance with the foregoing laws and regulations may harm our business and results of operations.
Competitors
 
We compete with other cannabis information platforms such as WeedMaps and Leafly, which provide information with respect to dispensary locations, strain information, and news relating to the cannabis industry.
