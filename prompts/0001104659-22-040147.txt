Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------

Overview
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”), references to the “Company” and to “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Silver Crest Acquisition Corporation.
We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the Cayman Islands on September 3, 2020. We were formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to as a “target business.” While the Company may pursue a business combination target in any business or industry, the Company intends to concentrate its efforts in identifying global or regional businesses with differentiated products and services in one or more high growth consumer and consumer technology sectors.
On September 28, 2020, we issued an aggregate of 7,187,500 shares of our Class B ordinary shares of par value $0.0001 each (“Class B ordinary shares” or “founder shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share, to Silver Crest Management LLC (“Sponsor”), an entity controlled by Leon Meng, our Chairman. On January 13, 2021, we effectuated a share capitalization of 0.2 founder shares for each one founder share, resulting in there being an aggregate of 8,625,000 founder shares outstanding.
On January 19, 2021, we consummated the initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 34,500,000 units, inclusive of 4,500,000 units that were subject to the underwriter’s over-allotment option. Each unit (“Unit”) consists of one Class A ordinary share of par value $0.0001 (“Class A ordinary share” or “public share”) and one-half of one redeemable warrant (“Warrant”), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $345,000,000.
Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, we consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) of 8,900,000 warrants (“Private Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Warrant, generating total proceeds of $8,900,000. The Private Warrants were sold to the Sponsor. The Private Warrants are identical to the Warrants sold in the IPO, except that the Private Warrants are non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by the Sponsor or their permitted transferees. Following the closing of the IPO and sale of Private Warrants, an aggregate amount of $345,000,000 has been placed in the Company’s trust account established in connection with the IPO.
On August 13, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with TH International Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company (“THIL”), and Miami Swan Ltd, a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly owned subsidiary of THIL (“Merger Sub”).
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, among other transactions and on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, (i) Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “First Merger”), with the Company surviving the First Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of THIL, (ii) the Company will merge with and into THIL (the “Second Merger” and together with the First Merger, the “Mergers”), with THIL surviving the Second Merger, (iii) immediately prior to the effective time of the First Merger (the “First Effective Time”), each Class B ordinary share of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time will be automatically converted into one Class A ordinary share of the Company and, after giving effect to such automatic conversion and the Unit Separation (as defined below), at the First Effective Time and as a result of the First Merger, each issued and outstanding Class A ordinary share will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be converted into the right of the holder thereof to receive one ordinary share of THIL (“THIL Ordinary Share”), after giving effect to the Share Split (as defined below), and (iv) each issued and outstanding Warrant will automatically and irrevocably be assumed by THIL and converted into a corresponding warrant exercisable for THIL Ordinary Shares.

2



Immediately prior to the First Effective Time, our Class A ordinary shares and Warrants comprising each issued and outstanding Unit, consisting of one Class A Share and one-half of one Public Warrant, will be automatically separated (“Unit Separation”) and the holder thereof will be deemed to hold one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one Public Warrant. No fractional Public Warrants will be issued in connection with such separation such that if a holder of such Units would be entitled to receive a fractional Public Warrant upon such separation, the number of Public Warrants to be issued to such holder upon such separation will be rounded down to the nearest whole number of Public Warrants and no cash will be paid in lieu of such fractional Public Warrants.
Immediately prior to the First Effective Time, THIL will effect a share split of each THIL Ordinary Share into such number of THIL Ordinary Shares, calculated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, such that each THIL Ordinary Share will have a value of $10.00 per share after giving effect to such share split (the “Share Split”).
On January 30, 2022, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 (the “First Amendment”) to the previously disclosed Merger Agreement, dated August 13, 2021, by and among the Company, THIL, and Merger Sub. Pursuant to the First Amendment, the Company, THIL and Merger Sub agreed to extend the Termination Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement) to March 1, 2022, after which either the Company or THIL may terminate the Merger Agreement.
On March 9, 2022, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 (the “Second Amendment”) to the previously disclosed Merger Agreement, dated August 13, 2021, by and among the Company, THIL, and Merger Sub, as amended on January 30, 2022. The Second Amendment amended the terms of the merger agreement to, among other things: extend the termination date (as defined in the Merger Agreement) to June 30, 2022; reduce the pre-transaction equity value of THIL from $1.688 billion to $1.4 billion; remove the minimum cash condition; shorten the exclusivity period applicable to the Company to May 1, 2022; and simplify the board of directors to a single class of directors each elected annually.
The consummation of the proposed Mergers is subject to certain conditions as further described in the Merger Agreement.
For more information about the Merger Agreement and the proposed Mergers, see our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 16, 2021, August 19, 2021, January 31, 2022, March 9, 2022 and subsequent filings with the SEC. Unless specifically stated, this Form 10-K does not give effect to the proposed Mergers and does not contain a description of the risks associated with the proposed Mergers. Such risks and effects relating to the proposed Mergers are described in a Form F-4 registration statement filed by THIL.
Our Strategy
Our business strategy is to identify and complete a business combination with a global or regional company in one or more high growth consumer and consumer technology sectors with strong potential to become a category and platform leader. We will leverage the broad and deep network of relationships, diverse set of industry expertise and proven deal sourcing capabilities of our management team and strategic advisors to provide us with what we anticipate being a strong pipeline of potential business combination targets.
Global consumption patterns and many consumer technology sectors are experiencing rapid changes and disruptions, resulting from the increasing adoption of new technology and the changing consumer behaviors accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. With a growing middle class that is highly receptive to new ways of doing things, China is at the forefront of these trends and our management team has insights in and relationships with leading consumer technology companies in China that are able to take advantage of these trends and achieve strong leadership positions. We believe our business combination targets in these rapidly changing consumer and consumer technology sectors will benefit from the strategic advice and hands-on collaboration that our management team can provide from years of experience working with companies in high growth and disrupted sectors.
Our management team has a strong track record of advising and partnering with consumer and consumer technology businesses that offer differentiated products and services, in large addressable markets relative to their current company sizes, in need of business model evolutions and strategic transformations. As businesses in different geographical markets react to changes and disruptions on different timelines and in different ways, certain consumer trends in one market (such as China) may become indicative of what will happen in another market (such as the U.S.), or vice versa. With diverse backgrounds and global transaction experience, we can take advantage of our management team’s global and China perspectives in evaluating potential opportunities. We believe our proven ability of guiding businesses to successfully scale through ever- changing markets makes a business combination with us an attractive path for companies seeking a strong partnership during and beyond the business combination.

Market Opportunity
We believe there are a significant number of new and existing companies in the high growth consumer and consumer technology sectors that are well-positioned to benefit from technology-enabled trends and changing consumer behaviors, such as consumer services, e-commerce, grocery retailing, health and wellness, food and beverage and beauty products. Furthermore, while we believe globalization has been the main economic theme for the past few decades, there is a growing trend of realigning ownership and management structures of prized consumer assets in many parts of the world. We believe that members of our management team are uniquely positioned with diverse backgrounds and global transaction experience to capitalize on four main types of strategic catalysts driving these realignment opportunities:

● | Global exiting China. Multinational companies are becoming receptive to full or partial divestitures of their Chinese operations when local buyers or local management teams are proven to be more capable of growing the businesses, extracting values and navigating competitive and regulatory landscapes. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Global to China. As China continues to grow at a higher rate than other major economies, the ability to enter and leverage the Chinese market becomes a key differentiator for a global consumer business, yet it is highly challenging for these companies to do so without local insights or partners. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | China exiting Global. Chinese conglomerates are considering selling non-core or sensitive overseas assets to better focus on core domestic markets, improve management efficiency and strengthen their balance sheets, as they have realized the challenges of managing an overseas or global business. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | China to Global. Strategic overseas expansions by Chinese companies, via organic growth or acquisitions, will continue to play a major role in solidifying global market positions and securing direct access to premium brands, products, technology and distribution channels that are synergistic to their core domestic capabilities. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe that the expertise of our management team will provide an attractive value proposition for potential business combination targets and differentiate us from other blank check companies in the marketplace.
Business Combination Criteria
Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines as primary filters in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet some of these criteria and guidelines. We will seek to acquire companies or assets with a significant share of the following characteristics:

● | Growth. Our focus will be on a target company’s ability or potential to generate sustainable growth, supported by its competitive strengths, technological advantages and differentiated products and services, in a large and dynamic market that can create attractive long-term superior returns 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Management. We seek to partner with a committed management team that has a well-defined vision for the business and the sector that they operate in. It is also important to identify a management team that has a proven track record of managing and scaling businesses, in a transparent corporate culture anchored in positive values. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Transition. Our management team has strong experience with businesses that need to be reinvigorated through capital injection, strategic repositioning and operational improvements. We will select companies that we can leverage our proprietary analysis and industry intelligence to offer constructive solutions to realize the intrinsic value to its fullest. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Transformation. We intend to search for a target company that will benefit from strategic transformations through well-timed and well-executed acquisitions, joint ventures or commercial affiliations. Our management team is well placed to add significant value in helping the target company in achieving growth and realizing synergies through future extensions beyond our business combination. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Valuation. We are experienced and sophisticated investors with a keen understanding of fundamental value through multiple economic and financial market cycles. We expect to complete a business combination in a disciplined manner, pairing significant upside potential with limited downside risks. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into a business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the SEC.
Sourcing of Acquisition Targets
In evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct a thorough due diligence review, which may encompass, among other things, meetings with management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information that will be made available to us. Additionally, members of our management team have significant executive management and public company experience, and accordingly have developed a deep network of contacts and relationships that will provide us with an important source of acquisition opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that opportunities will be brought to our attention by various unaffiliated sources, including investment banks, private equity groups, consultants, accounting firms and other investment market participants.
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, or from an independent valuation, appraisal or accounting firm, that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
Members of our management team directly or indirectly, own founder shares and/or Private Warrants and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. On August 13, 2021, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement with THIL. The Merger Agreement was subsequently amended on January 30, 2022 and March 9, 2022. See “—Overview” for more information relating to the Merger Agreement Amendments.
Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. We expect that if an opportunity is presented to one of our officers or directors in his or her capacity as an officer or director of one of those other entities, such opportunity would be presented to such other entity and not to us. For more information on the entities to which our officers and directors currently have fiduciary or contractual obligations, please refer to “Management—Conflicts of Interest.” Our second amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (“amended and restated memorandum and articles of association”) provide that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any officer or director unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as an officer or director of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination.

Evaluation of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination
In evaluating THIL, we considered a variety of factors, including the following:

● | growth potential
--+-----------------


● | brand recognition and potential
--+--------------------------------


● | capital requirements
--+---------------------


● | competitive position
--+---------------------


● | barriers to entry
--+------------------


● | meetings with incumbent management and employees
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | document reviews
--+-----------------


● | interviews of customers and suppliers
--+--------------------------------------


● | inspection of facilities
--+-------------------------


● | a review of financial and other information about the target and its industry.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. In evaluating THIL, we conducted an extensive due diligence review, which encompassed the factors above as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management.
Lack of Business Diversification
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.

We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.
Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination
We may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other reasons.
Under the listing rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”), shareholder approval would typically be required for our initial business combination if, for example:

● | we issue ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of our ordinary shares then-outstanding (other than in a public offering);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | any of our officers, directors or substantial security holders (as defined by the Nasdaq rules) has a 5% or greater interest, directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise, and the present or potential issuance of ordinary shares could result in an increase in issued and outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of 1% or more (or 5% or more if the related party involved is classified as such solely because such person is a substantial security holder); or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which shareholder approval is not required by law will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:

● | the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine shareholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek shareholder approval or doing so would place the company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the company;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the expected cost of holding a shareholder vote;
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | the risk that the shareholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | other time and budget constraints of the company; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | additional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to shareholders.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Permitted Purchases and Other Transactions with Respect to Our Securities
If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. Additionally, at any time at or prior to our initial business combination, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material nonpublic information), our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire public shares, vote their public shares in favor of our initial business combination or not redeem their public shares. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase public shares or warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act.
In the event that our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates purchase public shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights or submitted a proxy to vote against our initial business combination, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares and any proxy to vote against our initial business combination. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will be required to comply with such rules.
The purpose of any such transaction could be to (i) vote in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination, (ii) reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination, or (iii) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.
In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Class A ordinary shares or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
Our Sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the shareholders with whom they may pursue privately negotiated transactions by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders (in the case of Class A ordinary shares) following our mailing of tender offer or proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private transaction, they would identify and contact only potential selling or redeeming shareholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such shareholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination, but only if such shares have not already been voted at the shareholder meeting related to our initial business combination. Our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will select which shareholders to purchase shares from based on the negotiated price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant, and will be restricted from purchasing shares if such purchases do not comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.
Our Sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will be restricted from making purchases of shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. We expect any such purchases would be reported by such person pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements.

Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon the Completion of Our Initial Business Combination
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any, divided by the number of then-outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriter. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our Warrants. Further, we will not proceed with redeeming our public shares, even if a public shareholder has properly elected to redeem its shares, if a business combination does not close. Our Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by them in connection with (i) the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares.
Limitations on Redemptions
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). However, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes, or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation If No Initial Business Combination
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we will have only 24 months from the closing of the IPO to consummate an initial business combination. If we have not consummated an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our Warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to consummate an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, if we wind up for any other reason prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will follow the foregoing procedures with respect to the liquidation of the trust account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, subject to applicable Cayman Islands law.
Our Sponsor, officers and directors entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares they hold if we fail to consummate an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO (although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame).

Our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to their letter agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations set forth in “—Limitations on redemptions.” However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our Sponsor, officer, director or any other person.
We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the $1,000,000 held outside the trust account plus up to $100,000 of funds from the trust account available to us to pay dissolution expenses, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose.
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the Private Warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors, which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be less than $10.00. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third-party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third-party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third-party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third-party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. UBS Securities LLC will not execute an agreement with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third-party for services rendered or products sold to us (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third-party or prospective target business that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third-party, our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. However, we have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations nor have we independently verified whether our Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations, and we believe that our Sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.

In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest that may be withdrawn to pay our income tax obligations, and our Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment and subject to their fiduciary duties may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per public share.
We will seek to reduce the possibility that our Sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our Sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have access to up to $1,000,000 with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors, however such liability will not be greater than the amount of funds from our trust account received by any such shareholder.
If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per public share to our public shareholders.
Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
Our public shareholders are entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO, (ii) in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. Public shareholders who redeem their Class A ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote described in clause (ii) in the preceding sentence shall not be entitled to funds from the trust account upon the subsequent completion of an initial business combination or liquidation if we have not consummated an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO, with respect to such Class A ordinary shares so redeemed. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote.

Competition
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding Warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Employees
We currently have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
Corporate Information
Our executive offices are located at Suite 3501, 35/F, Jardine House, 1 Connaught Place, Central, Hong Kong, and our telephone number is +852 2165-9000. We maintain a website at https://www.silvercrestacq.com. The information on our website is not included as part of this annual report. We have registered our Units, Class A ordinary shares and Warrants under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act’), and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. Those reports are available on the SEC’s EDGAR system at www.sec.gov. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies,” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.

12



Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our Class A ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our Class A ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30.
Summary of Risk Factors
An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. The occurrence of one or more of the events or circumstances described in the section entitled “Risk Factors,” alone or in combination with other events or circumstances, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In that event, the trading prices of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Such risks include, but are not limited to, the following:

● | We are a recently incorporated company with no operating history and no revenues, and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Past performance by our management team or their respective affiliates may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our warrants are accounted for as liabilities and the changes in value of our warrants could have a material effect on our financial results.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. If we are unable to develop and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our shareholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed initial business combination, which means we may complete our initial business combination even though a majority of our shareholders do not support such a combination.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination may be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your shares from us for cash.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our initial shareholders have agreed to vote in favor of such initial business combination, regardless of how our public shareholders vote.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The ability of our public shareholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets, which may make it difficult for us to enter into a business combination with a target.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The requirement that we consummate an initial business combination within 24 months after the closing of our IPO may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a business combination and may limit the time we have in which to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets, in particular as we approach our dissolution deadline, which could undermine our ability to complete our initial business combination on terms that would produce value for our shareholders.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13




● | The coronavirus, or COVID-19, pandemic, including the efforts to mitigate its impact, has and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our search for a business combination, as well as any target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our initial shareholders, directors, executive officers, advisors and their affiliates may elect to purchase public shares or warrants, which may influence a vote on a proposed business combination and reduce the public “float” of our Class A ordinary shares or public warrants.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If a shareholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our public shares in connection with our initial business combination, or fails to comply with the procedures for tendering shares, such shares may not be redeemed.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | You will not have any rights or interests in funds from the trust account, except under certain limited circumstances. Therefore, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Nasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit shareholders’ ability to enter into transactions in our securities and subject us and them to additional trading restrictions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | You will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of many other blank check companies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Because of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our detachable redeemable warrants will expire worthless and no distributable redeemable warrants will be issued.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If the net proceeds of our IPO and the concurrent sale of Private Warrants not being held in the trust account are insufficient to allow us to operate for the 24 months following the closing of our IPO, it could limit the amount available to fund our search for a target business or businesses and our ability to complete our initial business combination, and we will depend on loans from our Sponsor, its affiliates or members of our management team to fund our search and complete our initial business combination.
