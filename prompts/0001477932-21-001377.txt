Item 1. Business.
 
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or Annual Report, and unless otherwise indicated, the terms “BT Brands,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “our Company,” and “our business” refer to BT Brands, Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries. Effective December 18, 2020 we reincorporated BT Brands from the State of Delaware to the State of Wyoming.
 
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Due to rounding, figures in tables may not sum exactly.
 
Overview of Our Company
 
We own and operate nine Burger Time restaurants and a Dairy Queen franchise. Our “Burger Time” restaurants feature a variety of burgers and other affordably priced foods such as chicken sandwiches, pulled pork sandwiches, side dishes and soft drinks. Our DQ restaurant serves the menu developed by DQ and sold across the country. We believe that our restaurants appeal to a broad range of consumers. We serve customers by way of a single or double drive-thru format and walk-up windows. We generally do not offer interior seating but provide outdoor seating areas and parking areas for customer use. Our Burger Time restaurants are located in the upper Midwest, including four restaurants in North Dakota, two in South Dakota and three in Minnesota. Our Dairy Queen franchise is located in Minnesota.
 
Our Burger Time operating principles include: (i) offering bigger burgers and more value for the money; (ii) offering a limited menu to permit the maximum attention to quality and speed of preparation; (iii) providing fast service by way of the single or double drive-thru design and a point-of-sale system that expedites the ordering and preparation process; and (iv) great tasting quality food made fresh to order at a fair price.
 
We operate in the fast-food drive-through category of the QSR of the restaurant industry. The QSR segment comprises fast food restaurants characterized by limited menus, limited or no table service and fast service. In the United States, the QSR segment is the largest segment of the restaurant industry and has demonstrated growth over a long period of time. According to recent estimates, this segment represents approximately 80 percent of total commercial foodservice visits in the United States and every day about 50 million Americans eat fast food. In 2019, this segment generated $273 billion in revenue in the U.S., making it the largest segment of the restaurant industry.
 
We are seeking to increase value for our shareholders in the foodservice industry. We expect to pursue the acquisition of multi-unit restaurant concepts and individual restaurant properties at attractive multiples of earnings, subject to our ability to obtain the capital required for any such acquisition. Once acquired, we will operate the business or businesses with a shared central management organization. Assuming we are successful in acquiring an operating business, following the acquisition, we expect to pursue expansion in the number of locations and to increase comparable store sales and profits. One possible growth strategy comprises the acquisition of operating assets and a subsequent franchise rollout of the acquired business, which management may conclude is an appropriate growth plan. Management of a franchise business will expose the Company to additional risks that we do not currently face.
 
Our principal business plan is to grow in the foodservice industry. We may develop additional Burger Time locations through the acquisition and conversion of existing properties. However, we expect our focus will be to identify and complete acquisitions of existing restaurant units and multi-unit chains which could be operated and expanded through the addition of new locations. 
 
Our Corporate History
 
The Company was originally incorporated in the state of Delaware as Hartmax of NY, Inc. in January 2016 with no assets or operations, and, until the Share Exchange described below, was majority-owned by affiliates of the placement agent in the 2018 Private Placement described below. Upon the closing of the 2018 Private Placement, the Company and BTND, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company, which we refer to as BTND, entered into a Share Exchange Agreement whereby the members of BTND exchanged all of their membership interests in BTND for shares of our common stock comprising 85.9% of the outstanding shares of our Company, without giving effect to the sale of any securities sold in the 2018 Private Placement (the “Share Exchange”). Two affiliates of the placement agent together held 11.7% of our common stock as of the closing of the Share Exchange, without giving effect to the sale of any securities sold in the 2018 Private Placement. After giving effect to the Share Exchange, the Company became the sole member of BTND and BTND’s managing member, Gary Copperud, became the chief executive officer of the Company. Following the Share Exchange, the Company changed its name to BT Brands, which is the parent company of BTND, which in turn became a wholly owned operating subsidiary of the Company.

In July 2018, we completed a private placement of our securities in which we issued and sold an aggregate of 205,002 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $3.00 per share and warrants to purchase up to 102,503 shares of our common stock with an initial exercise price equal to $4.00 per share, for which Maxim Group, LLC acted as the placement agent (the “2018 Private Placement”). We received approximately $615,000 in gross proceeds from the sale of the securities in the 2018 Private Placement. After deducting placement agent fees and other expenses payable by us in connection with the 2018 Private Offering, we received net proceeds of approximately $492,266.
 
On June 13, 2019, the Company amended and restated its certificate of incorporation to change its corporate name to “BT Brands, Inc.” to better reflect its multi-faceted growth plan, and to adopt certain provisions in line with its status as a public company. On June 13, 2019, the Company adopted amended and restated bylaws also to reflect the Company’s status as a public company. 
 
On June 12, 2020, the holders of 100% of our outstanding shares of common stock adopted resolutions approving the change of corporate domicile from Delaware to Wyoming. The Company affected the reincorporation by the filing of the appropriate documents with Delaware and Wyoming and as of December 18, 2020, the Company is domiciled in Wyoming.
 
The Burger Time brand originated in August 1987 with the opening of the first restaurant in Fargo, North Dakota. Over the next five years, several additional Burger Time restaurants were opened in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota. In 2005, the restaurant assets were sold to STEN Corporation, a public company of which Kenneth Brimmer, our Chief Operating Officer, Chairman and member of board of directors, and Gary Copperud, our Chief Executive Officer and a member of our board of directors, were officers and directors. In May 2007, BTND purchased the Burger Time assets from STEN Corporation. Gary Copperud was the managing member of BTND from the acquisition in 2007 until the closing of the Share Exchange and 2018 Private Placement.
 
Since 2007, BTND from time to time sold restaurant assets, including the underlying real property resulting in the closing of the stores located on the respective properties, and BTND has closed two other stores upon the expiration of the leaseholds on which they were located. In December 2018, we closed a store located in Richmond Indiana which was open for only 18 months.
 
Burger Time Restaurants
 
Menu
 
At our Burger Time restaurants, we seek to give our customers “more good food for their money” and to deliver it “hot ‘n fresh.”
 
Our Burger Time restaurants feature a wide variety of juicy, flame broiled burgers that we refer to as “Bigger Burgers” because they are made with approximately 25% more meat and are larger in diameter than the typical quarter pound burger offerings served by our competitors. Our burgers are custom made to our specifications by our supplier, with no fillers, only beef and salt. Each burger is prepared to a customer’s individual order and is served hot and fresh. Burger favorites include a mushroom Swiss burger, a jalapeno burger, and a full pound burger to satisfy the heartiest appetite. Other entrees items include chicken sandwiches, pulled pork sandwiches and chicken chunks. Our burgers and sandwiches are served on fresh buns and are topped with generous helpings of top-tier condiments. We offer an array of traditional and signature sides, many of which have evolved into regional favorites, such as large cut battered onion rings, cheese curds, fried pickle spears and chicken fries. We also offer soft drinks and other reasonably priced food and beverage items. From time to time, we offer specialty sandwiches and wraps at similar price points. Our limited menu is designed to deliver quality across all products, a high taste profile and speedy delivery.

Our objective is to serve customers within 60 seconds of their arrival during the peak day parts of lunch and dinner and within 3 minutes at other times. We can achieve this based on our single and double drive-thru format and on our integrated restaurant design and equipment lay-out that allows us to deliver exceptional food with fast service times. Our restaurants have a computerized point-of-sale system which displays each item ordered on a monitor viewed by food and drink preparers. This enables the preparers to begin filling an order before the order is completed and totaled, thereby increasing the speed of service to the customer and the number of sales per hour.
 
One of our key operating strategies is to minimize inventory and storage requirements, mandating frequent deliveries, which ensures that our food is always fresh. 
 
Our restaurants are generally open from 10 am to 10 pm seven days a week, for lunch, dinner and late-night snacks and meals. We also have recently introduced on-line ordering through our website with curbside delivery.
 
We believe that our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers, but we cater to consumers who appreciate the size and variety of our burgers, the value for the money proposition offered by our bigger burgers and the speed and efficiency offered by our single and double drive-thru windows.

We own the real estate on which all, but one of our ten operating restaurants are situated. We lease the property on which one of our Sioux Falls, South Dakota restaurants is situated. The Sioux Falls location is leased on a month-to-month basis, for which we pay monthly rent of $1,600 to a third party. 
 
All our owned properties are subject to mortgages secured by our real and personal property. At the end of fiscal 2020, we had approximately $3.2 million in outstanding mortgage notes payable on our owned locations. Interest on most of the notes is fixed at 4.75%, two of our notes have a fixed rate of 5.50%. One of the notes has an adjustable rate based on the five-year Treasury Note rate in 2021, with a floor of 4.00%. In addition to being secured by the restaurants and other property at the sites, each note is also personally guaranteed by Gary Copperud, our Chief Executive Officer.
 
Our restaurants are in commercial and mixed-use zoning districts, where our target customers work, which positions the restaurants for lunch and dinner visits.

Burger Time Restaurant Design
 
Our Burger Time units are free-standing facilities with single or double drive-thru capability and walk-up service windows. The menu, store layout and equipment are designed to work together to allow us to offer exceptional food with fast service times. This integrated design allows for maximum food output with minimal labor.
 
Burger Time stores have a highly visible, distinctive look that is intended to appeal to customers of all ages. Historically, Burger Time stores have ranged from 600 to 1000 sq. ft. Regardless of its size, each restaurant is designed for maximum financial and operational efficiency, with only four employees required to effectively staff a store. As a result of their small size, our restaurants can be constructed on as little as 15,000 square feet of land. Because of the small size of the structure, our restaurants generally require a smaller capital investment and have lower occupancy and operating costs per restaurant than traditional quick-service competitors. The size of the facility also permits somewhat greater flexibility with respect to the selection of prospective sites for restaurants.
 
Our Burger Time design encompasses a red and white structure and features a single or double drive thru. The roof overhangs to protect the drive thru windows from the weather. A walk-up service window is situated at the front of each restaurant. Our design and color scheme are intended to convey a message of “clean and fast” to the passing motorist. Most of our restaurants do not provide an interior dining area but offer parking and a patio for outdoor eating. 
 
Staffing
 
Each restaurant employs twelve to sixteen employees, including a manager, and an assistant manager. Work shifts are staggered and vary in length of time to ensure superior customer service during our busiest times. We are focused on customer service and we seek to staff our stores with personnel who are friendly, and customer focused.
 
We have enjoyed a long relationship with many of the managers of our restaurants, several of whom have been with Burger Time more than seven years. We will seek to establish similar relationships with the managers joining us in the future.
 
Our highly experienced managers train new assistant managers in all facets of a restaurant’s operations. Other personnel can be trained in a matter of days. 
 
Our manager training stresses food quality; fast, friendly customer service; restaurant cleanliness; and proper management operations of a quick service restaurant. We also focus on food safety and sanitation, employment laws and regulations, and systems to control food and labor costs. All managers and assistants are required to obtain the required food safety (HACCP) training and obtain the Certification applicable to their location.
 
Our managers and assistant managers are full time employees. We support our managers by offering competitive wages, including incentive bonuses tied to unit performance. Most other staff members are part time employees. 
 
Our future growth and success are highly dependent upon our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified restaurant management and hourly staff members, which may be challenging.
 
Restaurant Reporting

Each restaurant has a computerized point-of-sale system monitored by the management of the restaurant. With this system, managers can monitor sales, labor, customer counts and other pertinent information. This information allows a manager to better control labor utilization, inventories and operating costs. Information is reported up to our corporate staff where it is analyzed to maximize cost efficiencies in food and labor costs and inventories and customer counts on a weekly basis and profit and loss statements and balance sheets on a monthly basis.
 
The general manager of each restaurant reports directly to a Director of Operations who in turn reports to our Chief Operating Officer, who oversees all aspects of restaurant operations including kitchen operations, restaurant facility management, new restaurant openings and the roll-out of key operational initiatives. All our restaurants prepare detailed monthly operating budgets and compare their actual results to their budgets.

Purchasing and Distribution 
 
We purchase most of our food, paper, packaging and related supplies from Sysco Corporation, the nation’s largest distributor of food products. Sysco distributes these supplies to our restaurants on a frequent and routine basis. Typically, our inventory of supplies is never more than $5,000 at any restaurant. This ensures that our food is consistently fresh and frees cash flow for other purposes. Our agreement with Sysco expires on May 30, 2021. We have customarily entered into a new agreement with Sysco every two years. Either party may terminate the agreement after the initial year with 180 days’ notice or in the event of a material breach that is not cured within 60 days. The agreement may be terminated by Sysco in the event that we fail to pay any amounts owed, or if, in Sysco’s sole judgment, either our financial position deteriorates materially, or Sysco becomes aware of circumstances that would materially impact our ability to meet our financial obligations.
 
We are party to a five-year exclusive beverage service agreement under which we have agreed for most locations to purchase our beverages, other than coffee, tea or milk, from Pepsi-Cola Bottling of Fargo., through December 21, 2025. Under this agreement, Pepsi provides to us economic incentives for being an exclusive supplier and provides beverage-dispensing equipment free of charge. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of a material breach that is not cured within 30 days.
 
Beef is our largest product cost item and is expected to remain such for the foreseeable future. Fluctuations in supply and prices can significantly impact our financial results.
 
Marketing and Advertising 
 
Our marketing efforts for Burger Time are intended to convey the principles that we believe attract our core customers – we provide our patrons with more good food for their money by offering them “a bigger burger” and we give it to them “hot ‘n fresh.”
 
To date, our marketing and advertising spend has been allocated to advertisements in newspapers and radio in the geographic areas in which our restaurants are located. In addition, we have employed product discount coupons, live remote broadcasts, customer contests and direct mailings. We also utilize marketing incentives from our suppliers whenever possible. We recently introduced an on-line ordering capability and curbside delivery program through our website, and we expect to develop an increased emphasis on direct data base marketing supplemented by social media tools, such as Facebook, to promote our brand and local stores. Collectively, however, our marketing-related expenditures have historically comprised less than 1% of our net revenues.
 
We believe our restaurant sales have traditionally, and generally, been derived from drive-by traffic and dedicated return visits from loyal customers. However, we recognize that as we expand our restaurant base, our marketing and advertising expenditures may need to increase. We further expect that as we open new restaurants in existing geographic areas, we will be able to take advantage of operating and marketing efficiencies resulting from the “clustering” of our restaurants.
 
We expect to develop and deploy a more sophisticated marketing campaign, including an expanded social media presence, intended to build consumer brand awareness of our restaurants.
 
Dairy Queen Franchise
 
In October 2015, we acquired a 99% ownership interest in a Dairy Queen franchise in Ham Lake, Minnesota. The remaining 1% ownership interest in the franchise is owned by the General Manager of the location who possesses certain Dairy Queen qualifications and whose ownership is required under the operating agreement with the franchisor. 
 
Because we are a franchisee, we are party to a franchise agreement with Dairy Queen that, among other things, restricts our menu offerings at this location to the established Dairy Queen menu and severely limits our flexibility in the operating model we may employ at this location. Specifically, we are prohibited from selling any Burger Time items at this franchise and we may not market this restaurant as a part of our Burger Time family. 
 
We have no plans at this time to enter into any other franchise agreements with Dairy Queen or any other national chain of restaurants, as we believe our profitable future can best be realized by expanding the Burger Time brand or by acquiring either restaurant business assets or another restaurant chain. However, should we become aware of another attractive opportunity to assume control of a franchise, we may consider it.

Burger Time Restaurant Economic Model
 
Our restaurant economic model is based on three principles: a low capital investment, low conversion and incremental expenses and lean and disciplined operating efficiencies. For example, in the case of our Burger Time locations, because we do not offer interior seating, our restaurant footprint is small, generally around 650 sq. ft., which can be situated on a parcel of real estate as small as 15,000 sq. ft (approximately 0.344 acres), which includes sufficient space for parking and outdoor seating. While some of our newer restaurants have been larger, enabling us to offer some limited in-store seating, our basic model remains the same and our real estate costs, whether we purchase or lease, remain relatively low.
 
Operationally, we take several steps to maintain efficiency, including maintaining inventory of no more than approximately $5,000 per store at any given time (which also has the advantage of allowing for frequent deliveries of fresh food). 
 
Our Burger Time restaurant investment model targets a total cash investment of between $325,000 and $535,000, or an average of $430,000. Real estate and finance costs vary materially by location but, assuming the average investment figure applies, the amount allocated to the purchase of real estate would be approximately $225,000.
 
Costs to develop a new Burger Time location can fluctuate significantly, based on the number and timing of restaurant openings and the specific expenses incurred for each restaurant.
 
Based on our experience, we believe that our new restaurants may require six to nine months after opening, or more, to achieve their targeted restaurant-level sales and operating margin due to cost of sales and labor inefficiencies, especially with respect to restaurants that we open in new geographic areas. We have limited experience opening new restaurants; however, based upon our experience the initial 2-3 months shows a strong “honeymoon” effect as patrons try a new location. As is common in the restaurant industry, following the initial honeymoon period, we see sales stabilize at a lower level as we attract regular repeat customers with the goal of growing the base of customers reaching targeted sales levels in six to nine months and continue to grow in the future periods. If we open restaurants in new and untested markets, achieving targeted sales may take longer since the local population will not be familiar with our brand and it will take time to build brand awareness. How quickly new restaurants achieve their targeted sales and operating margin depends on many factors, including the level of consumer familiarity with our brand, as well as the availability of experienced managers and other staff. However, every restaurant has a unique opening sales pattern, and this pattern is difficult to predict. As a result, any number of restaurant openings in any single fiscal quarter, along with their associated opening expenses, could have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations for that period. We believe that by a restaurant’s second full year of operations, we can achieve an annualized cash-on-cash return of approximately 30% of our investment, although there is no assurance that this target will be met. We determine the annualized cash-on-cash return based upon the free cash flow generated by the unit after all expenses including required capital improvement, compared to the net cash invested after deducting and mortgage financing secured before or after the unit is opened. This is the targeted return calculated based upon our new unit investment analysis and is based upon limited experience in opening new stores and there is no assurance the targeted returns will be achieved. “Cash-on-cash return” is calculated based on the restaurant-level earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), and is based upon the net equity investment by the Company in relation to EBITDA on an annualized basis. Our acquisition criteria seek to achieve a return in excess of the 30% target; however, as a result of the many risks and uncertainties surrounding an acquisition, there is no assurance this return will be achieved.
 
Growth Strategy
 
We are seeking to increase value for our shareholders in the foodservice industry. We expect to pursue the acquisition of multi-unit restaurant concepts and individual restaurant properties at attractive multiples of earnings. Once acquired, we will operate the business or businesses with a shared central management organization. Assuming we are successful in acquiring an operating business, following the acquisition, we expect to pursue a growth plan to both expand the number of locations and to increase comparable store sales and profits. One possible growth strategy comprises the acquisition of operating assets and a subsequent franchise rollout of the acquired business, which management may conclude is an appropriate growth plan. Management of a franchise business will expose the Company to additional risks that we do not currently face.

Our business plan is to grow through acquisitions in the foodservice industry. In addition, we may develop additional Burger Time locations through the acquisition and conversion of existing properties. We also expect to identify and complete acquisitions of existing restaurant units and multi-unit chains which could be operated and expanded through the addition of new locations. 
 
The financing we received from the 2018 Private Placement did not provide sufficient capital to undertake the development of new Burger Time locations or complete a significant restaurant acquisition. Recently, we have been reviewing potential acquisitions that will allow us to leverage our existing infrastructure with established profitable locations as we seek a high return on our invested capital; however, we do not have any specific acquisitions planned. Any such acquisition likely will require raising additional capital to complete the purchase and to grow the business. 
 
We will seek to acquire one or more existing restaurants and/or restaurant chains, including concepts that feature menu options that differ from the menu items we offer at Burger Time. Restaurant businesses become available for acquisition frequently and we believe that we may be able to purchase either individual properties or multi-unit businesses at prices providing an attractive return on our investment. Successful execution of our acquisition strategy will allow us to diversify our operations both into other dining concepts and geographic locations. This strategy may include one or more restaurants that lease locations from a third party as opposed to owning the real property on which the stores are located. This approach would result in a change to our historical core business model which was to own the real estate on which our restaurants operate. This approach may prove to be riskier to our business and less appealing to investors and potential sources of funding.
 
In all cases, implementation of our growth strategy is contingent upon the availability of adequate financing to fund both the acquisition and our expansion, of which we cannot be assured.
 
Expand Our Restaurant Base Through Acquisitions
 
The acquisition of an existing restaurant chain or individual restaurants combined with new restaurant development is expected to be the key driver of our growth strategy. We believe that there are numerous opportunities to acquire and open new restaurants in existing and new geographic areas. Initially, we plan to develop new restaurants in some of our existing markets to take advantage of operational and financial efficiencies. This approach can provide specific economic benefits including lower supply and distribution costs, improved marketing efficiencies and increased brand awareness. 
 
From time to time, we may close restaurants based on operating metrics or other factors. We have closed only one restaurant since 2011 (Richmond, Indiana opened in 2017 and closed in 2018) and do not anticipate closing any restaurants in 2020 or in the foreseeable future thereafter. There is no guarantee that we will be able to increase the overall number of our restaurants. We may be unsuccessful in expanding within our existing markets or into new markets for a variety of reasons, including competition for customers, sites, employees, licenses and financing.
 
Increase Comparable Restaurant Sales
 
We believe that acquisitions of restaurants relative to our comparable restaurant base will be our primary driver of growth and increased revenue. However, we are considering ways to improve sales and restaurant performance. We expect to develop a more aggressive on-line presence including a mobile app which could be downloaded by customers and used to drive immediate customer visits to our locations. In addition, we will continue to create and offer seasonal and limited-time specialties to keep our menu fresh and our customers interested. We may require additional capital for such purposes, and we cannot be certain that such capital will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.
Increase Brand Awareness 
 
Our loyal customer base and following is now entering a third generation of Burger Time devotees. In order to develop and enhance brand awareness, we intend to update and expand our web presence. We expect to create a complete web-based program designed around mobile usage, including introducing a web- based loyalty program. We will deploy internet advertising to match specific menu items targeted to specific demographic groups. We will deploy cross-over ads with radio and social media interacting with each other. We intend to develop social media campaigns in other markets. We may require additional capital for such purposes, and we cannot be certain that such capital will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.
Trademarks and Service Marks

We have registered our trademarks “It’s Burger Time” and “Hot ‘n Now” with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We believe that our trademarks and service marks have value to us and are important to our marketing efforts. We may develop additional marks in the future. Our policy is to pursue registration of our marks whenever possible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of its marks. 
Competition 
 
The restaurant industry is highly competitive and is dominated by major chains that possess substantially greater financial and other resources than we have. The industry is affected by changes in geographic competition, changes in the public’s eating habits and preferences, local and national economic conditions affecting consumer spending habits, population trends and local traffic patterns. Key elements of competition in our industry are the price, quality and value of food products offered; quality and speed of service; advertising effectiveness; brand name awareness; restaurant convenience; and attractiveness of facilities. We compete primarily based on value of food (portion size), price, food quality and speed of service. A significant change in pricing or other marketing strategies by one or more of our competitors could have an adverse impact on our sales, earnings and growth. Our competition includes a variety of national and regional fast-food chains and locally owned restaurants that offer carry-out, dine-in, delivery and catering services, many of which have achieved significant brand and product recognition and engage in extensive advertising and promotional programs. Our competition in the geographic areas in which operate includes McDonalds, Burger King, Carl’s Jr. and Wendy’s.

Seasonality 
 
Seasonal factors and the timing of holidays cause our revenue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our revenue per restaurant is typically slightly lower in the first and fourth quarters due to the impact of cold weather at our upper Midwest locations. Adverse weather conditions may also affect customer traffic, especially in the first and fourth quarters, when customers do not use our outdoor seating areas, which impacts the use of these areas and may adversely affect our revenue. 
Employees
 
As of January 3, 2021, the Company had three members of its senior corporate personnel. Each of the Burger Time restaurants and the Dairy Queen franchise has both a manager, who is a full-time, salaried employee, and an assistant manager or supervisor and a varying number of restaurant staff, all of whom are hourly employees. As of January 3, 2021, we had approximately 107 employees, of which 17 were full time and 90 were part time. None of our employees are unionized or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we consider our current employee relations to be good.
Marketable Securities
 
We have, from time to time, purchased publicly traded marketable securities. Historically, these securities consisted of investments in exchange-listed common stocks with published prices per share readily available.
