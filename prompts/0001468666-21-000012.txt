Our employees and contractors involved in technology development are required to sign agreements acknowledging that all inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments, processes and other intellectual property rights conceived or reduced to practice by them on our behalf are our property, and assigning to us any ownership that they may claim in those intellectual property rights. We maintain internal policies regarding confidentiality and disclosure. Our customer and resale contracts prohibit reverse engineering, decompiling and other similar uses of our technologies and require that our technologies be returned to us upon termination of the contract. We also require our vendors and other third parties who have access to our confidential information or proprietary technology to enter into confidentiality agreements with us.
Despite our precautions, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use, without our consent, intellectual property that we own or otherwise have the right to use. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties, and the expenses we incur in protecting our intellectual property rights, may adversely affect our business.
Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, which leads to frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. In particular, large and established companies in the IT security industry have extensive patent portfolios and are regularly involved in both offensive and defensive litigation. From time to time, third parties, including some of these large companies as well as non-practicing entities, may assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights against us, our channel partners or our end-customers, which we are obligated to indemnify against such claims under our standard license and other agreements. Successful claims of infringement by a third party, if any, could prevent us from performing certain solutions, require us to expend time and money to develop non-infringing solutions, or force us to pay substantial damages (including, in the United States, treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents), royalties or other fees.
Patents and Patent Applications
As of January 29, 2021, we owned 47 issued patents and 14 pending patent applications in the United States and three issued patents and three pending patent applications outside the United States. The issued patents are currently expected to expire between 2023 and 2038. Although we believe that our patents as a whole are important to our business, we are not substantially dependent on any single patent.
We do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to modify or narrow our claims, as has happened in the past with respect to certain claims. Any patents that may be issued to us may not provide us with any meaningful protection or competitive advantages, or may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalid, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon them. 
Trademarks and Copyrights
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has granted us federal registrations for some of our trademarks. Federal registration of trademarks is effective for as long as we continue to use the trademarks and maintain our registrations as permitted under federal law. We also have obtained protection for some of our trademarks, and have pending applications for trademark protection, in the European Community and various countries. We may, however, be unable to obtain trademark protection for our technologies and names that we use, and names, slogans or logos that we use or may use may be deemed non-distinctive, and therefore unable to distinguish our solutions from those of our competitors in one or more countries.
We have entered into a trademark license agreement with Dell Inc. under which Dell Inc. has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free worldwide license to use the trademark “DELL,” solely in the form of “SECUREWORKS-A DELL COMPANY,” in connection with our business and products, services and advertising and marketing materials related to our business. 
Backlog
We define backlog as the non-cancellable value of subscription-based solutions to be provided under Taegis SaaS and managed security services contracted with a customer that have not yet been provisioned or installed. Backlog is not recorded in revenue, deferred revenue or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements until we establish a contractual right to invoice, at which point it is recorded as revenue or deferred revenue, as appropriate. All contractual amounts included in backlog are available to be installed and revenue recognition commenced within the coming fiscal year. As of January 29, 2021 and January 31, 2020, backlog of subscription-based solutions was approximately $7.7 million and $12.9 million, respectively. Backlog is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals and the mix of solutions under contract with customers. Accordingly, we believe that fluctuations in backlog are not always a reliable indicator of future revenues.
Seasonality
Given the annual budget approval process of many of our customers, we have begun to see seasonal patterns in our business. Seasonal variations in our financial results may become more pronounced in future periods, with sales to new customers and additional sales to existing customers being greater in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter, as compared to the first half of the year. In addition, we also experience seasonality in our gross and operating margins, with lower margins in the first half of our fiscal year as a result of greater expenditures for payroll taxes and annual sales and marketing events. This seasonality may also affect the timing of our operating cash flow.
Human Capital Resources
Employee Population
As of January 29, 2021, we employed 2,696 full-time employees. Approximately 52.5 percent of our employees were located in the United States and the remainder were located in 24 other countries. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor organization or the subject of a collective-bargaining agreement. Employees of some of our foreign subsidiaries are represented on workers’ councils.
Compensation, Benefits and Well-being
We are committed to providing employees with compensation and benefits that support their physical, mental and financial well-being. We believe our compensation program is designed to attract and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business objectives and assist in the achievement of our strategic goals. In addition to competitive base salaries, eligible employees can receive short-term incentives and long-term cash or equity awards. We also offer employees a wide array of benefits, including life and health and welfare insurance, retirement benefits, and paid time off.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we instituted a mandatory work-from-home policy for almost all but a small number of onsite essential personnel, and we restricted travel to essential “business-critical” needs. With the support and commitment of our employees, we were able to seamlessly pivot to a work-from-home model and continue protecting our customers without interruption. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, our Chief Executive Officer hosted weekly all-hands update calls, and we believe open and on-going communications have been critical to maintaining our culture and productivity during the pandemic. During this period, we have taken a flexible approach to help our employees manage their work and personal responsibilities, with a focus on employee well-being, health and safety.
Diversity and Inclusion
We believe that our future growth and innovation depends on a company culture that promotes diversity and inclusion, and seek to advance these values in our hiring, development and advancement practices.
We also seek to connect our employees across regions and provide them with opportunities to enhance cultural awareness and enable collaboration.
Communication and Engagement 
We strongly believe that our corporate culture depends on our employees’ engagement and understanding of their contribution to the achievement of our strategic imperatives, vision and mission. In addition to prioritizing regular communications, we conduct regular employee surveys to seek feedback on what is going well and where we can focus our efforts to do more. Our annual company survey surpassed an 80% participation rate in fiscal 2021, representing a wide cross section of our employee population. In addition, we have active employee resource groups, which are designed to address the need for more social and community interaction in our globally diverse workforce.
Community Involvement
We aim to give back to the communities where we live and work and believe that this commitment helps in our efforts to attract and retain employees. We partner with a variety of universities and inclusion-focused programs to promote technology education for all. Beyond contributions of cash, we encourage employee volunteerism at all of our locations, as well as volunteer service throughout the year.
