 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
Overview
 
We are an intellectual property asset management company. Our principal operations include the development, acquisition, licensing and enforcement of intellectual property rights that are either owned or controlled by us or one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. We currently own, control or manage eight intellectual property portfolios, which principally consist of patent rights. Our eight intellectual property portfolios include the three portfolios which we acquired in October 2015 from Intellectual Ventures Assets 16, LLC (“Intellectual Ventures”). As part of our intellectual property asset management activities and in the ordinary course of our business, it has been necessary for us or the intellectual property owner who we represent to initiate, and it is likely to continue to be necessary to initiate, patent infringement lawsuits and engage in patent infringement litigation. We anticipate that our primary source of revenue will come from the grant of licenses to use our intellectual property, including licenses granted as part of the settlement of patent infringement lawsuits. We also generate revenue from management fees from managing intellectual property portfolios. 
 
We seek to generate revenue from three sources:
 

● | Patent licensing fees relating to our intellectual property portfolio, which includes fees from the licensing of our intellectual property, primarily from litigation relating to enforcement of our intellectual property rights. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Management fees, which we receive for managing structured licensing programs, including litigation, related to our intellectual property rights. 
● | Licensed packaging sales, which relate to the sale of licensed products. 

 
Intellectual property monetization includes the generation of revenue and proceeds from the licensing of patents, patented technologies and other intellectual property rights. Patent litigation is often a necessary element of intellectual property monetization where a patent owner, or a representative of the patent owner, seeks to protect its patent rights against the unlicensed manufacture, sale, and use of the owner’s patent rights or products which incorporate the owner’s patent rights. In general, we seek to monetize the bundle of rights granted by the patents through structured licensing and when necessary enforcement of those rights through litigation, although to date all of our patent license revenues have resulted from litigation.
 
We intend to develop our business by acquiring intellectual property rights, either in the form of ownership of or an exclusive license to the underlying intellectual property. Our goal is to enter into agreements with inventors of innovative technologies for which there may be a significant market for products which use or incorporate the intellectual property. We seek to purchase all of, or interests in, intellectual property in exchange for cash, securities of our company, the formation or a joint venture or separate subsidiary in which the owner has an equity interest, and/or interests in the monetization of those assets. Our revenue from this aspect of our business can be generated through licensing and, when necessary, which is typically the case, litigation efforts as well as intellectual property management fees. We engage in due diligence and a principled risk underwriting process to evaluate the merits and potential value of any acquisition, partnership or joint venture. We seek to structure the terms of our acquisitions in a manner that will achieve the highest risk-adjusted returns possible, in the context of our financial condition. In connection with the acquisition of intellectual property portfolios, we have granted the party providing the financing an interest in any recovery we have with respect to the intellectual property purchased with the financing, and we expect that we will have to continue to grant such interests until and unless we have generated sufficient cash from licensing our intellectual property to enable us to acquire additional intellectual property portfolios without outside financing. However, we cannot assure you that we will ever generate sufficient revenues to enable us to purchase additional intellectual property without third-party financing.

We employ a due diligence process before completing the acquisition of an intellectual property interest. We begin with an investment thesis supporting the potential transaction and then proceed to test the thesis through an examination of the critical drivers of the value of the underlying intellectual property asset. Such an examination focuses on areas such as title and inventorship issues, the quality of the drafting and prosecution of the intellectual property assets, legal risks inherent in licensing programs generally, the applicability of the invention to the relevant marketplace and other issues such as the effects of venue and other procedural issues. However, our financial position may affect our ability to conduct due diligence with respect to intellectual property rights.
 
It is frequently necessary to commence litigation in order to obtain a recovery for past infringement of, or to license the use of, our intellectual property rights. Intellectual property litigation is very expensive, with no certainty of any recovery. To the extent possible we seek to engage counsel on a contingent fee or partial contingent fee basis, which significantly reduces our litigation cost, but which also reduces the value of the recovery to us. We do not have the resources to enable us to fund the cost of litigation. To the extent that we cannot fund litigation ourselves, we may enter into an agreement with a third party, which may be the patent owner or the former patent owner who transferred the patent rights to us, or an independent third party. In view of our limited cash and our working capital deficiency, we are not able to institute any monetization program that may require litigation unless we engage counsel on a fully contingent basis or we obtain funding from third party funding sources. In these cases, either counsel is afforded a greater participation in the recovery or the third party that funds the litigation would be entitled to participate in any recovery.
 
Purchase of Intellectual Property from Intellectual Ventures
 
On October 22, 2015, pursuant to an agreement with an effective date of July 8, 2015, as amended, between us and Intellectual Ventures, we purchased three groups of patents from Intellectual Ventures for a purchase price of $3,000,000, of which $1,000,000 was paid at the closing from the proceeds of the $1,250,000 loan from United Wireless, the second installment was paid on September 30, 2016 from a $1,000,000 advance from United Wireless and the remaining $1,000,000 is due in September 2017. We acquired the intellectual property at the closing, and we granted Intellectual Ventures a security interest in the patents transferred to us as security for the payment of the balance of the purchase price. The security interest of Intellectual Ventures is senior to the security interest of United Wireless in the proceeds derived from such patents. The patent portfolios which we acquired from Intellectual Ventures are the anchor structure portfolio, the power management/bus control portfolio and the diode on chip portfolio, which are described under “Business – Our Intellectual Property Portfolios.”
Our Organization
 
We were incorporated in Delaware on July 17, 1987 under the name Phase Out of America. On September 21, 1997, we changed our name to Quest Products Corporation, and, on June 6, 2007, we changed our name to Quest Patent Research Corporation. We have been engaged in the intellectual property monetization business since 2008. Our executive principal office is located at 411 Theodore Fremd Ave., Suite 206S, Rye, New York 10580-1411, telephone (888) 743-7577. Our website is www.qprc.com.

Our Intellectual Property Portfolios
 
Mobile Data
 
The real-time mobile data portfolio relates to the automatic update of information delivered to a mobile device without the need for a manual refreshing. The portfolio is comprised of U.S. Patent No. 7,194,468 “Apparatus and Method for Supplying Information” and all related patents, patent applications, and all continuations, continuations-in-part, divisions, extensions, renewals, reissues and re-examinations relating to all inventions thereof (the “Mobile Data Portfolio”). We initially entered into an agreement with the patent owner, Worldlink Information Technology Systems Limited, whereby we received the exclusive license to license and enforce the Mobile Data Portfolio. Under the agreement we received a monthly management fee and a percentage of licensing revenues. Subsequently Worldlink transferred its remaining interest in the Mobile Data Portfolio to Allied Standard Limited. In October 2012, we entered into an agreement with Allied pursuant to which Allied transferred its entire right title and interest in the Mobile Data Portfolio to Quest Licensing Corporation, which was at the time, a wholly-owned subsidiary. Under the agreement, Allied was entitled to receive a 50% interest in Quest Licensing. Quest Licensing’s only intellectual property is the Mobile Data Portfolio. Our agreement with Allied provides that we and Allied will each receive 50% of the net licensing revenues, as defined by the agreement. In June 2013, we entered into an agreement with The Betting Service Limited, an entity controlled by a former director of Worldlink. Pursuant to the agreement, we granted The Betting Service an interest in licensing proceeds from the Mobile Data Portfolio in return for The Betting Service’s assistance in developing certain Mobile Data Portfolio assets. In April 2014, we entered into a further agreement with Allied whereby Allied relinquished certain rights under the October 2012 agreement, including its entitlement to a 50% interest in Quest Licensing, in exchange for our commitment to fund a structured licensing program for the Mobile Data Portfolio. 
 
In March 2014, we entered into a funding agreement whereby a third party agreed to provide funds to us to enable us to implement a structured licensing program, including litigation if necessary, for the Mobile Data Portfolio and engaged counsel on a partial contingency basis in connection with a proposed patent infringement action relating to the Mobile Data Portfolio. Under the funding agreement, the third party receives an interest in the proceeds from the program, and we have no other obligation to the third party.
 
In April and June 2014, as part of a structured licensing program, Quest Licensing Corporation brought patent infringement suits in the U.S. District for the District of Delaware against Bloomberg LP et. al., FactSet Research Systems Inc., Interactive Data Corporation, SunGard Data Systems Inc. and The Charles Schwab Corporation et. al. These cases have been consolidated for trial. A hearing, known as a Markman hearing, in which the judge examines the evidence from the parties on the appropriate meanings of relevant key words in the claim was held on February 8, 2016. In June and August 2016 Quest Licensing Corporation entered into settlement agreements with SunGard Data Systems Inc. and FactSet Research Systems Inc. On January 19, 2017 the Court granted the remaining defendants’ motion for summary judgment of non-infringement. On January 31, 2017, Quest Licensing Corporation filed a notice of appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit whereby Quest Licensing Corporation appealed the court’s order construing the terms of U.S. patent No. 7,194,468 as well as the court’s order granting defendants’ motion for summary judgment of non-infringement. In connection with this litigation, a third party funding source incurred approximately $809,000 in 2016 and $80,000 in 2015, which was paid to litigation counsel and other third parties. In addition, the funding source paid management fees to us of approximately $25,000 in 2016 and $170,000 in 2015. Modest licensing fees generated from settlement agreements were paid directly to the funding source pursuant to our agreement with the funding source. As a result, through December 31, 2016, we did not receive any proceeds from the Mobile Data Portfolio.
 
Following the court’s decision granting the defendant’s motion for summary judgment, the defendants moved for an award of attorneys’ fees under Section 285 of the patent act which provides that “the court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.” Our funding source for the Mobile Data Portfolio litigation has no obligations to fund any judgment against us. Although the motion, if granted, would result in a judgment against Quest Licensing Corporation, such subsidiary does not have the financial resources to enable it to pay any judgment which may be rendered against it, and, the defendants may seek to enforce their judgment by seeking to foreclose on the patents owned by the subsidiary or seek to force the subsidiary into bankruptcy and purchase the patents in the bankruptcy proceeding, either of which could result in a default under our agreement with United Wireless.
 
Online Marketing, Sweepstakes, Promotions & Rewards (Von Kohorn Portfolio)
 
The portfolio consists of three United States Patents that include patent claims related to, among other areas, online couponing, print-at-home boarding passes and tickets, online sweepstakes; including the promotion by television networks of online sweepstakes (the “Von Kohorn Portfolio”). In December 2009, we entered into an agreement with Intertech Holdings, LLC pursuant to which our wholly-owned subsidiary, Quest NetTech Corporation, acquired by assignment all right, title, and interest in the Von Kohorn Portfolio. Under the agreement, we will receive 20% of adjusted gross recoveries, as defined. In August 2013, we and Intertech Holdings amended the December 2009 agreement to provide that Intertech Holdings will receive 33% of the adjusted gross recoveries and Quest NetTech will receive 67% of adjusted gross recoveries.

In February 2015, Quest NetTech brought several patent infringement suits against various entities in the U.S. District for the Eastern District of Texas. These actions were settled.  
 
In March 2016, Quest NetTech brought several patent infringement suits against various entities in the U.S. District for the Eastern District of Texas. These actions were settled.
 
We generated license fees of approximately $75,000 and $215,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
Flexible Packaging - Turtle PakTM
 
In March 2008, we entered into an agreement with Emerging Technologies Trust whereby our majority-owned subsidiary, Quest Packaging Solutions Corporation, acquired the exclusive license to make, use, sell, offer for sale or sublicense the intellectual property of Emerging Technologies Trust (the “Turtle Pak™ Portfolio”). The Turtle Pak portfolio relates to a cost effective, high-protection packaging system recommended for fragile items weighing less than ten pounds. The intellectual property consists of two U.S. patents, U.S. Patent No. RE36,412 and U.S. Patent No.6,490,844, and the Turtle PakTM trademark. Turtle Pak™ brand packaging is suited for such uses as electrical and electronic components, medical, dental, and diagnostic equipment, instrumentation products, and control components. Turtle Pak™ brand packaging materials are 100% curbside recyclable.
 
As the exclusive licensee and manager of the manufacture and sale of licensed product, we coordinate the manufacture and sale of licensed products to end users; we contract for the manufacture and assembly of the product components, and we coordinate order receipt, fulfillment and invoicing. Revenues from the TurtlePakTM product sales were approximately $18,000 and $33,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We continue to generate modest revenue from this product.
 
Universal Financial Data System
 
The invention describes a universal financial data system which allows its holder to use the device to access one or more accounts stored in the memory of the device as a cash payment substitute as well as to keep track of financial and transaction records and data, such as transaction receipts, in a highly portable package, such as a cellular device (the “Financial Data Portfolio”). The inventive universal data system is capable of supporting multiple accounts of various types, including but not limited to credit card accounts, checking/debit accounts, and loyalty accounts. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Wynn Technologies Inc., acquired US Patent No. 5,859,419, from the owner, Sol Wynn. In January 2001, we filed a reissue application for the patent, and the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued patent RE38,137. This reissued patent, which contains 35 separate claims, replaces the original patent, which had seven claims. In February 2011, we entered into a new agreement with Sol Li (formerly Sol Wynn), pursuant to which we issued to Mr. Li a 35% interest in Wynn Technologies and warrants to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.001 per share. We also agreed that Mr. Li would receive 40% of the net licensing revenues generated by Wynn Technologies with respect to this patent, which is the only patent owned by Wynn Technologies.
 
In August 2010, we entered into a five-year consulting agreement with Alex W. Hart pursuant to which he agreed to serve as a special consultant to us on the development and commercialization of the Data System Patent. Pursuant to this agreement, we issued Mr. Hart an option to purchase 5,000,000 shares common stock at a price of $0.001 per share, those options expired unexercised on December 31, 2015.
 
Through December 31, 2016, we did not generate any revenue from the Financial Data Portfolio.

Rich Media
 
The rich media portfolio is directed to methods, systems, and processes that permit typical Internet users to design rich-media production content (i.e., rich-media applications), such as websites. The portfolio consists of U.S. Patent No. 7,000,180, “Methods, Systems, and Processes for the Design and Creation of Rich Media Applications via the Internet” and all related patents, patent applications, corresponding foreign patents and foreign patent applications and foreign counterparts, and all continuations, continuations-in-part, divisions, extensions, renewals, reissues and re-examinations relating to all inventions thereof (the “Rich Media Portfolio”). In July 2008, we entered into a consulting and licensing program management agreement with Balthaser Online, Inc., the patent owner, pursuant to which we performed services related to the establishment and management of a licensing program to evaluate and analyze the relevant market and to obtain licenses for the Rich Media Portfolio in exchange for management fees as well as an irrevocable entitlement to a distribution of 15% of all proceeds generated by the Rich Media Portfolio for the remaining life of the portfolio regardless of whether those proceeds are derived from litigation, settlement, licensing or otherwise. Our 15% distribution right is subject to reduction to 7.5% in the event that we refuse or are unable to perform the services detailed in the agreement. 
 
Through December 31, 2016, we did not generate any revenue from the rich media patents.
 
Anchor Structure Portfolio
 
This portfolio, which we acquired from Intellectual Ventures in October 2015 and transferred to a newly formed subsidiary, Mariner IC Inc., consists of two United States patents which relate to technology for incorporating metal structures in the corners and edges of semiconductor dies to prevent cracking from stresses.
 
In March 2016, we entered into a funding agreement whereby a third party agreed to provide funds to us to enable us to implement a structured licensing program, including litigation if necessary, for the Anchor Structure Portfolio and engaged counsel on a partial contingency basis in connection with a proposed patent infringement action relating to the Anchor Structure Portfolio. Under the funding agreement, the third party receives an interest in the proceeds from the program, and we have no other obligation to the third party.

Following the execution of the funding agreements and the engagement of counsel, in April 2016, Mariner IC brought patent infringement suits in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against MediaTek Inc., Texas Instruments Incorporated, LG Electronics, Inc., Toshiba Corporation, and Funai Electric Co., Ltd. In May 2016, the action against Funai was dismissed, and in November 2016, the action against Texas Instruments was dismissed. A Markman hearing has been scheduled for May 25, 2017 and trial has been scheduled for December 4, 2017, though it is possible that these dates may be postponed.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the funding agreement and the partial contingency agreement with counsel, we do not have any liability or obligations with respect to the costs associated with prosecuting the actions, and we do not receive any payments for any assistance which we may provide in connection with the litigation. Both the funding source and counsel will participate in any recovery in these lawsuits.
 
Through December 31, 2016 we did not generate any licensing revenue from the Anchor Structure Portfolio.
 
Power Management/Bus Control Portfolio
 
This portfolio, which is the second portfolio which we acquired from Intellectual Ventures and transferred to a newly-formed subsidiary, Semcon IP Inc., consists of four United States patents that cover fundamental technology for adjusting the processor clock and voltage to save power based on the operating characteristics of the processor and one United States patent that relates to coordinating direct bus communications between subsystems in an assigned channel.
 
In March 2016, we entered into a funding agreement whereby a third party agreed to provide funds to us to enable us to implement a structured licensing program, including litigation if necessary, for the Anchor Structure Portfolio and engaged counsel on a partial contingency basis in connection with a proposed patent infringement action relating to the Anchor Structure Portfolio. Under the funding agreement, the third party receives an interest in the proceeds from the program, and we have no other obligation to the third party.
 
Following the execution of the funding agreement and partial contingency agreement with counsel, in April 2016, Semcon IP Inc. brought patent infringement suits in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against Huawei Technologies, MediaTek Inc., STMicroelectronics Inc., Texas Instruments Incorporated and ZTE Corporation. A Markman hearing has been scheduled for June 14, 2017 and trial has been scheduled for January 2, 2018, though it is possible that these dates may be postponed.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the funding agreement and the partial contingency agreement with counsel, we do not have any liability or obligations with respect to the costs associated with prosecuting the actions, and we do not receive any payments for any assistance which we may provide in connection with the litigation. Both the funding source and counsel will participate in any recovery in these lawsuits.
 
Through December 31, 2016 we did not generate any licensing revenue from the Power Management/Bus Control Portfolio.
 
Diode on Chip Portfolio
 
This portfolio, which is the third portfolio which we acquired from Intellectual Ventures and transferred to a newly-formed subsidiary, IC Kinetics Inc., consists of three United States patents and one pending continuation application which cover technology relating to on-chip temperature measurement for semiconductors.
Competition
 
We encounter and expect to continue to encounter competition in the areas of intellectual property acquisitions for the sake of licensure from both private and publicly traded companies that engage in intellectual property monetization activities. Such competitors and potential competitors include companies seeking to acquire the same intellectual property assets and intellectual property rights that we may seek to acquire. Entities such as Acacia Research Corporation, Document Security Systems, Inc., Intellectual Ventures, Wi-LAN, Conversant IP, VirnetX Holding Corporation, Marathon Patent Group, Inc., Network-1 Security Solutions, Round Rock Research LLC, IPvalue Management Inc., Form Holdings, Pendrell Corporation , Finjan Holdings, Inc., Inventergy Global, Inc., Netlist Inc., Parkervision Inc., Spherix Incorporated, United Wireless, Walker Innovation, Inc. and others derive all or a substantial portion of their revenue from patent monetization activities, and we expect more entities to enter the market. Most of our competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial resources and personnel than we have.
 
We also compete with venture capital firms, strategic corporate buyers and various industry leaders for intellectual property and technology acquisitions and licensing opportunities. Many of these competitors have more financial and human resources than our company. In seeking to obtain intellectual property assets or intellectual property rights, we seek to both demonstrate our understanding of the intellectual property that we are seeking to acquire or license and our ability to monetize their intellectual property rights. Our weak cash position may impair our ability to negotiate successfully with the intellectual property owners.
 
Other companies may develop competing technologies that offer better or less expensive alternatives to intellectual property rights that we may acquire and/or out-license. Many potential competitors may have significantly greater resources than we do. The development of technological advances or entirely different approaches could render certain of the technologies owned or controlled by our operating subsidiaries obsolete and/or uneconomical.

Agreements with United Wireless
 
Summary
 
On October 22, 2015, we entered into a series of agreements with United Wireless:
 
Pursuant to a securities purchase agreement between us and five of our subsidiaries (Quest Licensing Corporation, Wynn Technologies, Inc., Mariner IC Inc., Semcon IP Inc., and IC Kinetics Inc.), at the closing, United Wireless agreed to lend us a total of $4,250,000, of which $3,000,000 was to be used to purchase the intellectual property from Intellectual Ventures and the balance was for working capital. At the closing, we issued to United Wireless our 10% promissory note in the principal amount of $1,250,000 due September 30, 2020, for which we received $1,250,000, of which $1,000,000 was used to pay the initial installment of the purchase price to Intellectual Ventures, and was paid directly to Intellectual Ventures, and $250,000 was paid to us for working capital. On September 30, 2016, United Wireless made a $1,000,000 loan for us to make the second installment of the purchase price to Intellectual Ventures, and United Wireless made the payment directly to Intellectual Ventures. On each of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016, United Wireless made working capital loans to us in the amount of $125,000. As of December 31, 2016, United Wireless had made loans to us of $2,500,000, of which $2,000,000 was used to make payments to Intellectual Ventures and $500,000 was used for working capital. The terms of the notes are described under “Promissory Notes.”
 
Pursuant to the securities purchase agreement, at the closing we sold to United Wireless 50,000,000 shares of common stock for $250,000, or $0.005 per share.
 
Pursuant to the securities purchase agreement, we granted United Wireless an option to purchase a total of 50,000,000 shares, with exercise prices of $0.01 per share as to 16,666,667 shares, which may be exercised from September 30, 2016 through September 30, 2020, $0.03 per share as to 16,666,667 shares, which may be exercised from September 30, 2017 through September 30, 2020, and $0.05 per share as to 16,666,666 shares, which may be exercised from September 30, 2018 through September 30, 2020.
 
United Wireless agreed to make loans to us for payment of the second and third $1,000,000 payments due to Intellectual Ventures regardless of whether we are in compliance with our obligations under the securities purchase agreement or our other agreements with United Wireless.
 
All of the notes to be issued to United Wireless, whether in respect of the purchase of the patent rights from Intellectual Ventures or for working capital, will have the same terms and conditions, including default provisions and conversion rights. In the event that certain events of default, which are called Conversion Eligible Events of Default, shall have occurred and are continuing on the date a $1,000,000 payment is due to Intellectual Ventures, United Wireless shall have the obligation to make the payment, and immediately upon the United Wireless’ payment to Intellectual Ventures, we shall be deemed to have assigned, transferred and conveyed to United Wireless and/or its nominee full, absolute and unconditional title to and ownership of the stock of three subsidiaries that hold the patents acquired from Intellectual Ventures, and our obligations on the notes including the conversion rights, to the extent that the notes relate to the payment of the purchase price of the patents from Intellectual Venture, terminate, and United Wireless will have no further obligation to make working capital loans to us. Our obligations, including United Wireless’ conversion rights, on the notes issued for working capital, will continue in full force and effect. As of the date of this annual report, of the $2,618,065 note that is outstanding, $2,000,000 relates to the purchase of the patents from Intellectual Ventures and $500,000 relates to working capital and $118,065 relates to interest accrued through, and added to principal on, September 30, 2016 per the terms of the note. 
 
We entered into a monetization proceeds agreement pursuant to which United Wireless received the right to receive 15% of the net monetization proceeds received from (a) the patents acquired by us from Intellectual Ventures and (b) the patents in our mobile data and financial data intellectual property portfolios.
 
Our obligations under our agreements with United Wireless, including our obligations under all notes issued to United Wireless and the monetization proceeds agreement, are secured by a pledge of the stock of the three subsidiaries that hold the patents acquired from Intellectual Ventures and by the proceeds from the intellectual property represented by (i) the patents acquired from Intellectual Ventures and (ii) the intellectual property in the mobile data and financial data portfolios.
 
Five of our subsidiaries, Quest Licensing, Wynn, Mariner, Semcon, and IC, guaranteed our obligations to United Wireless.

We granted United Wireless certain registration rights with respect to (i) the 50,000,000 shares of common stock purchased by United Wireless at the closing, (ii) the 50,000,000 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the purchase options, and (iii) in the event that the notes become convertible, to the extent that the note holders request, the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes.
 
We agreed that, within 135 days from the closing date (i.e., by March 2, 2016), we would increase our authorized common stock from 390,000,000 shares to 1,250,000,000 shares, and, in the event that, in the future, the number of authorized shares of common stock is not sufficient to enable the full conversion of the notes, we will have 135 days to take corporate action, as necessary, so as to have a sufficient number of shares, including to increase the common stock (or effect a reverse split or a combination of an increase in the authorized common stock and a reverse split) to an amount requested by United Wireless, or absent such request, as we believe to be necessary such that there will be sufficient shares of common stock available for full conversion of the notes. United Wireless agreed to vote its shares or give its consent in connection with any such increase in authorized common stock. On January 22, 2016, we filed an amended and restated certificate of incorporation which increased our authorized common stock to 1,250,000,000 shares. On the dates that United Wireless purchased notes from us in 2016, we were in compliance with the authorized share requirement. Because there is no fixed conversion price, compliance with the authorized share reserve requirement is outside of the control of the Company. As a result of fluctuations in the Company’s stock price, at various times during the period, beginning May 4, 2016 and through December 31, 2016, but never for a period exceeding 135 days, the Company had insufficient authorized shares of common stock necessary for United Wireless to convert its notes and exercise its options. Because of a decrease in the price of our common stock, since February 13, 2017, we did not have a sufficient number of shares to meet the authorized share requirements. United Wireless has not requested that we increase the common stock. On March 28, 2017, our board of directors approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation increasing our authorized common stock to 10,000,000,000 shares, subject to stockholder approval. Pursuant to the agreement with United Wireless, we have 135 days from February 13, 2017 (or from such later date as we have sufficient shares available for full conversion of the notes), to take corporate action, as we deem necessary, to have a sufficient number of shares available for full conversion of the notes, including an increase in our authorized common stock or a reverse split or combination such that there will be sufficient shares for conversion of the notes in the event the notes become convertible. The failure to have sufficient authorized common stock may result in a Conversion Eligible Event of Default. 
 
We agreed with United Wireless that, as long as United Wireless’ stockholdings exceed 10%, United Wireless has the right to designate one member of the board of directors and at such time and for as long as United Wireless’ stockholdings exceed 24.9%, United Wireless may nominate a second director to the board. Unless a Conversion Eligible Event of Default shall have occurred, United Wireless agreed not to seek to elect a majority of the board for a period of at least three years from the closing date. We agreed that the size of the board would not exceed five.
 
Commencing six months from the closing date, if the shares owned by United Wireless cannot be sold pursuant to a registration statement and cannot be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without our being in compliance with the current public information requirements of Rule 144, if we are not in compliance with the current public information requirements, the agreements provide for the payment of damages to United Wireless. United Wireless has claimed that we are in violation of the registration requirements and we believe we have valid defenses to such claims. The damages are computed at 1.5% of the aggregate purchase price paid for such securities, which was $250,000 on the date we fail to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement and each 30 days thereafter.


The securities purchase agreement, the note issued at the closing, the monetization proceeds agreement, the patent proceeds security agreement, the pledge and security agreement and the registration rights agreement are exhibits to this annual report. The description of these agreements are summaries only and are qualified in their entireties by the agreements filed as exhibits.
 
Promissory Notes
 
The promissory notes bear interest at 10% per annum and mature on September 30, 2020. Interest accrues through September 30, 2018, with accrued interest being added to principal on each of September 30, 2016, 2017 and 2018. Subsequent to September 30, 2018, we are to pay interest quarterly, with the first interest payment being due on December 31, 2018. We have the right to prepay the notes in whole at any time and in part from time to time. Although the notes have no conversion rights, if a Conversion Eligible Event of Default occurs, the notes become convertible at a conversion price equal to 90% of the closing sale price of our common stock on the principal market on which the common stock is trading on the trading day immediately preceding the date the holder gives notice of conversion. As required by the securities purchase agreement, we have increased our authorized common stock to 1,250,000,000 shares. However, we cannot assure you that such number of shares would be sufficient to permit conversion of the notes in full if a Conversion Eligible Event of Default should occur. We are required to have reserved from our authorized and unissued common stock, 130% of the number of shares of common stock as shall be necessary for issuance upon conversion of the notes.

Conversion Eligible Events of Default include the breach of selected representations and warranties and covenants contained in the securities purchase agreement and the note, including our failure to pay principal of any note or interest and other charges in excess of $100,000. Although the observance of these covenants is generally within our control, one of the provisions which would trigger a Conversion Eligible Event of Default is our inability to have sufficient shares reserved for issuance upon conversion of the notes for more than 135 consecutive days from the date of such inability. Because there is no fixed conversion price, this reserve requirement is outside of the control of the Company.


The occurrence of a Conversion Eligible Event of Default would not only make the notes convertible but, if it exists on the date a $1,000,000 payment is due to Intellectual Ventures, it would permit United Wireless to take title to the stock of the three subsidiaries which own the patents acquired from Intellectual Ventures, in which event our obligations under those notes that, at the date of such failure, were issued in connection with the purchase of the patents from Intellectual Ventures, would terminate.
 
The holders of the notes also have the right to demand redemption of the notes at 110% of the principal amount of the note in the event of a change of control.
 
Monetization Proceeds Agreement
 
Pursuant to the monetization proceeds agreement, United Wireless has a right to receive 15% of the net monetization proceeds from (i) the patents acquired by us from Intellectual Ventures and (ii) the patents in our mobile data and financial data intellectual property portfolios. The agreement has no termination provisions, so United Wireless will be entitled to its percentage interest as long as revenue can be generated from the intellectual property covered by the agreement.
 
Net monetization proceeds represent the amount by which any consideration received from the patents, including royalty payments and amounts received as a result of litigation relating to the patents exceeds monetization expenses, including legal fees, and certain other expenses, but not operating expenses not relating to the monetization activities, including patent litigation. The percentage payable with respect to monetization proceeds from the mobile data and financial data intellectual property (but not the patents acquired from Intellectual Ventures) is reduced in the event that United breaches its agreement to make working capital loans pursuant to the securities purchase agreement.
 
Grant of Security Interest
 
Payment of the notes and our obligations under the monetization proceeds agreement as well as the other obligations under the agreements with United Wireless is secured by a security interest in all proceeds (from litigation or otherwise) from the (i) the patents acquired from Intellectual Ventures and (ii) the intellectual property in the mobile data and financial data portfolios, and a pledge of the stock of the three subsidiaries which hold the patents acquired from Intellectual Ventures. The security interest in the proceeds from the patents acquired from Intellectual Ventures is junior to the security interest held by Intellectual Ventures in the patents and proceeds thereof which were acquired by us from Intellectual Ventures as security for the payment of the $1,000,000 balance of the purchase price of the patents. The security interest in proceeds from the patents relating to the Company’s mobile data portfolio is junior to the security interest held by Longford Capital Fund I, LP, which is providing litigation funding relating to this portfolio.

Registration Rights Agreement
 
Pursuant to a registration rights agreement, we agreed to file a registration statement with the SEC covering the 50,000,000 shares of common stock issued to United Wireless at the closing and the 50,000,000 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the purchase option. We are required to file the registration statement within 60 days of the October 22, 2015 closing, which is December 21, 2015, and have the registration statement declared effective by the SEC within 120 days of the closing if the registration statement is not subject to a full review by the SEC and 180 days if the registration statement is subject to a full review. We filed the registration statement on December 14, 2015 and it was declared effective by the SEC on February 11, 2016. We are required to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement until United Wireless (or its transferees) may sell all the shares covered by the registration statement without restriction or limitation pursuant to Rule 144 and without the requirement to be in compliance with Rule 144(c)(1). We are also required to file a registration statement covering the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes upon request by the note holders. The notes do not become convertible until and unless there is a Conversion Eligible Event of Default, and the failure to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement is not a Conversion Eligible Event of Default. The registration rights agreement provides for us to pay damages in the event that we do not meet the required deadlines or do not maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement. The damages are computed at 1.5% of the aggregate purchase price paid for such securities, which was $250,000 on the date we fail to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement and each 30 days thereafter. The registration ceased to be current and effective on November 11, 2016. We believe we have valid defenses to any claim that United Wireless may make.
Research and Development
 
Research and development expense are incurred by us in connection with the evaluation of patents. We did not incur research and development expenses during 2015 or 2016.
 
Employees
 
As of April 14, 2017, we have no employees other than our two officers, only one of whom, Mr. Jon Scahill, our chief executive officer and president, is full time. Our employees are not represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good.
