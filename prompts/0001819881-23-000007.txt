Item 1. Business
Unless the context otherwise requires, references to “we”, “us”, “our”, "Paya", "Paya Holdings", or “the Company” refer to Paya Holdings Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Overview
We are a leading independent integrated payments and commerce platform providing card, Automated Clearing House ("ACH"), and check payment processing solutions via software to middle-market businesses in the United States. Our solutions integrate with our customers’ core business software to enable payments acceptance, reconcile invoice detail, and post payment information to their core accounting systems. In this manner, we enable our customers to collect revenue from their consumer ("B2C") and business ("B2B") customers with a seamless experience and high-level of security across payment types. Given the focus on B2B and consumer bill payments integrated into software, as of December 31, 2022, approximately 85% of our payment card volume is card-not-present and on average, our customers accept approximately $500,000 of credit and debit card volume per year.
We concentrate on strategic vertical markets defined by strong secular growth and low penetration of electronic payments that are non-cyclical in nature such as B2B goods & services, healthcare, faith-based & non-profit, government & utilities, and education. Our technology, distribution, and support are tailored to the specific and complex payment needs of customers in these verticals. We have deep expertise of industry-specific considerations and believe this makes us a leading provider of integrated payment solutions in these markets with a sustainable competitive advantage.
In these strategic verticals, we deliver our payment solutions through front-end Customer Relationship Management ("CRM") and back-end accounting independent software vendors (“ISVs”) who sell or refer our integrated payments bundled with their proprietary software solutions to their customers. We enter into contracts with these ISVs where they deliver new customers to us in exchange for a portion of transaction revenue those customers generate. We refer to these ISVs as "partners" and the customers they bring to us as "customers." Our partners choose Paya because of our easy to use and feature rich technology platform, vertical expertise, and commitment to customer service. To our partners, embedding payments in their software increases customer life-time value and generates a new revenue stream through a share of Paya’s payments revenue.
Our payment technology is centered around Paya Connect, a proprietary, API-driven and service-oriented payments platform which integrates with our customers’ front-end CRM and back-end accounting software and acts as a universal gateway which connects to multiple card processors as well as Paya’s proprietary ACH processing platform. Paya Connect also serves as the foundation for modular value-added solutions including digital boarding, flexible funding, e-invoicing, auto-billing and recurring payments, tokenized and secure transactions, and robust customer and partner reporting, which are differentiators in our key end markets. Further, Paya Connect’s architecture allows us to easily add incremental value-added services into our ecosystem through API integration.
We have built industry-leading scale with a highly diverse customer portfolio. As of December 31, 2022, we served approximately 100,000 businesses, representing over $49 billion in card and ACH payment volume for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our customer portfolio is highly diversified with no single customer representing more than 1% of payment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Average transaction size was approximately $300 inclusive of all card and ACH payment transactions in 2022. 
We derive most of our revenue from fees paid by our customers which principally include a processing fee that is charged as a percentage of total payment volume, as well as fixed interchange fees and convenience-based fees. In some cases, including card processing in our government and utilities end-market and in ACH and check processing, fees are charged in the form of a fixed fee per transaction. Our revenue is re-occurring in nature because of the consistency of B2B and consumer bill payments, the mission-critical and embedded nature of the solutions we provide, and the high switching costs associated with these solutions due to complex levels of integration. We also 
benefit from a high degree of operating leverage given the combination of our highly scalable payments platform and low customer acquisition costs resulting from our partner-centric model.
Segments
We have two reportable segments, Integrated Solutions and Payment Services.
Integrated Solutions
Our Integrated Solutions segment represents the delivery of our credit and debit card payment solutions, and to a lesser extent, ACH processing solutions to customers via integrations with software partners across our strategic vertical markets. Our Integrated Solutions partners include vertical focused front-end CRM software providers as well as back-end Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") and accounting solutions. Integrated Solutions represented 64.2% of revenue for the year ending December 31, 2022.
Payment Services
The Payment Services segment represents the delivery of card payment processing solutions to our customers through resellers, as well as ACH, check, and gift card processing. Card payment processing solutions in this segment utilize Paya’s core technology infrastructure and do not typically originate through a software integration. ACH, check, and gift card processing may or may not be integrated with third-party software, however, Paya focuses on strategically cross selling these products with new software partners. Payment Services represented 35.8% of revenue for the year ending December 31, 2022.
Business Developments; Merger of Paya with Nuvei Corporation
On January 9, 2023, Paya announced the execution of an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Nuvei Corporation, a corporation incorporated pursuant to the laws of Canada (“Parent”), and Pinnacle Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Purchaser”).
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, Purchaser agreed to commence a tender offer (the “Offer”), to purchase all of the shares of common stock of the Company issued and outstanding at a price of $9.75 per share (the “Offer Price”), in cash, without interest thereon (but subject to applicable withholding). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, Paya will merge with and into the Purchaser, with Paya continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the “Merger”). If the Merger is consummated, the Company’s common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market ("Nasdaq") and the duty to file reports will be suspended under Section 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
On January 24, 2023, Purchaser commenced the Offer by filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and mailing to the Company’s stockholders a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO. The Company concurrently filed with the SEC and mailed to stockholders a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, which recommended that the Company’s stockholders tender their shares to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer. The Offer will initially remain open for a minimum of 20 business days from the date of commencement of the Offer. The Merger Agreement includes customary termination provisions for both the Company and Parent, and provides that, in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including termination by the Company to accept and enter into an agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement), the Company will pay Parent a termination fee of approximately $38 million. The parties to the Merger Agreement are also entitled to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement.
The Merger Agreement provides, among other things, that upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each share of the Company’s common stock that is not (a) validly tendered and irrevocably accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offer, (b) held by a stockholder who is entitled to demand appraisal and who has properly and validly exercised appraisal rights in accordance with, and 
who has complied with, applicable law, or (c) held by Parent, Purchaser, or any other direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, will be thereupon converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. The proposed Merger is expected to close during the first quarter of 2023.
Strategic Vertical Markets
We are a leading provider of integrated payment solutions in attractive vertical markets where we have a sustainable competitive advantage. Our technology solutions are tailored to the specific, complex needs of customers in these verticals, and we have deep expertise of industry-specific considerations. Strategic vertical markets include:
B2B Goods & Services
We have a leading presence in the B2B goods and services end market given our beginnings as part of Sage and deep expertise in accounting software integrations. We offer integrations into back-end ERP and accounting solutions, including Sage Intacct, X3, 50, 100, 300, and 500, as well as Acumatica and Intuit Quickbooks. In this vertical, we leverage value-added resellers as distribution, in addition to receiving referrals directly from our software partners. We also integrate with ISVs that focus on sub-verticals such as manufacturing and construction. This end market is characterized by under-penetration of electronic payments and high retention due to the required levels of integration.
Healthcare
Our healthcare portfolio is primarily comprised of ambulatory providers and healthcare practices that we serve through ISV partners. Our differentiated solutions in this end market include flexible funding, pre-authorization, and reporting capabilities, acceptance of health savings account ("HSA") & flexible spending account ("FSA") cards, and multi-layer location management. While our existing customers focus on these sub-verticals, our core capabilities are broadly applicable to software providers focused on specialty medicine. The healthcare end market is characterized by underlying secular growth and complex payment functionality needs that serve as a barrier to entry for competitors.
Faith-based, Education & Non-profit
Our faith-based and non-profit customers, which utilize our payments technology for donation collection and fundraising, have unique feature requirements including recurring billing, event management, and integrated e-Commerce. In this end market, we utilize both ISV partner and direct distribution models. Our direct distribution model was acquired as part of our acquisition of Stewardship, which delivers payment processing solutions via a proprietary donation management software platform. The non-profit market is characterized by late adoption of electronic payments, with adoption accelerating in recent years due to advances in payment technology.
The education vertical represents a growth area for us, with increasingly strong relationships with education-specific ISVs that deliver tuition collection tools, cafeteria and school store management software, and other administrative solutions. Education is generally non-cyclical and benefits from attractive levels of electronic payment adoption and the need for flexible settlement solutions.
Government & Utilities
Like the faith-based and non-profit vertical, our government and utilities portfolio consists of both ISV partner and direct distribution models. Our direct distribution model was developed through our acquisition of First Billing Services and further enhanced through our acquisition of The Payment Group, LLC ("TPG" or "The Payment Group"), which provides e-billing and payment portal software. Since acquisition, we have also found success selling First Billing’s software through partnerships in this vertical. Electronic payment methods in this end market are significantly underpenetrated, providing attractive underlying customer growth and high retention, while also benefiting from low cyclicality given the nature of these services. TPG provides municipalities and 
courts with a completely automated payment system for receiving payments online and processing them instantly. New competitor entry into this vertical is challenging given the importance of track-record and reference clients servicing government and municipal entities effectively.
Paya End Market Revenue Composition by Vertical as of December 31, 2022:
(1) Includes both card and ACH.
Partner-centric Distribution
Paya’s overall strategy is built with our partner-centric distribution model in mind, including our technology roadmap, customer service capabilities, and sales focus. This results in an attractive integrated experience of software and payments for the customers of our partners. Our approach allows us to flexibly and scalably address multiple attractive verticals at once and invest in technology rather than a “feet on the street” direct salesforce.
To understand our strategy requires a better understanding of our partners. We serve independent software vendors ranging from front-end CRM applications to back-end accounting solutions. These partners are typically differentiated in their vertical markets and serve a sophisticated, middle-market business customer, who in turn uses the software to sell their goods and services B2B or B2C. Paya’s core function is allowing these businesses to accept payments from their customers in a way that improves customer experience and automates the invoice to payment reconciliation.
The first pillar of our sales strategy is to sign new partnerships in our core markets. Our go-to-market organization utilizes a solutions-oriented approach that focuses on understanding our software partners’ payments needs and helping them craft solutions that differentiate themselves in a specific marketplace. We believe that successfully embedding payments in our partners' software greatly enhances their customer retention and provides them a substantial new revenue stream in excess of the typical monthly subscription.
In addition to signing new partnerships, we also focus on increasing the penetration of our offerings among the installed base of our existing partners. We do this effectively by selling our Paya Connect functionality to an installed base that may not be fully utilizing integrated payment capabilities.
We go to market via two primary partner channels: ISVs and value-added resellers. While we have existing independent sales organizations ("ISO") partners that focus primarily on reselling payments, technological advances have driven growth of the ISV and value-added reseller ("VAR") channels, which are in turn displacing the ISO channel and growing far more rapidly.
•Integrated Software Vendors. Our ISV partners strive for business growth, relying on our comprehensive, secure payments solutions to support their vertical-specific needs. We work with these software companies to provide a future-proof payments platform to their client base, constantly innovating to provide new payment functionality and maintaining compliance with evolving industry standards and regulations. Integrating their business management software seamlessly into our platform creates higher lifetime customer value and provides a more complete end-to-end experience.
Our integrations ensure seamless delivery of our full suite of payment processing capabilities to our customers. These integrations are also a critical part of our marketing strategy, as we work with partners to actively promote our preferred relationship and the advantages of an integrated payment solution to their existing base of customers.
Finally, these ISVs typically focus on a specific vertical or sub-vertical market and chose Paya because the payment functionality and support we offer is tailored to the specific needs of their given vertical.
•Value-Added Resellers. We work with VARs that bundle our suite of features and services with an existing software product and resell the package as an integrated or complete turn-key solution. This is a key channel for our B2B vertical given the prevalence of the value-added reseller distribution model among ERP and accounting software providers.
•Direct Sales. Although our sales force is primarily focused on winning channel partners, we have a direct sales force that brings our proprietary software solutions with embedded payments directly to customers in the government & utilities and faith-based & non-profit end markets.
•Independent Sales Organizations. We partner with ISOs in our Payment Services segment that have their own distribution capabilities and technologies. We provide them with the products and tools we believe are necessary to acquire new customers and grow their adoption of electronic payments. In addition to payment functionality, we deliver valuable back-office support, training, and the tools necessary for independent sales organizations to manage their business.
•ACH Sales. For our ACH product, we deploy a go-to-market model leveraging ISOs and third-party resellers combined with cross-selling to our integrated partnerships to expand distribution of our capabilities. These efforts are represented in our Payment Services segment.
Products, Solutions and Technology
We provide a robust suite of proprietary technology solutions tailored to address the evolving needs of our sophisticated partners and customers. Our offerings are developed with vertical specific needs in-mind and are designed to support the end-to-end payments requirements of tech-savvy, middle market businesses. Our solutions are highly scalable, built for exceptional up-time, sustain high transaction volume, and offer a multi-channel, payment method agnostic experience.
Organization
We have significantly invested in our information technology ("IT") and product teams and capabilities. Our product management team employs a customer-centric approach. This team maintains a close connection with the sales force, a strong understanding of customer feature requirement needs in the pipeline, and a continuous assessment of market trends. The team of product management professionals is supported by an agile IT development organization and robust on-shore and off-shore development support focused on building payments applications and additional value-added services into integrated solutions. Our technology infrastructure team is focused on maintaining the integrity and security of client data and ensuring best-in-class cyber security technology is deployed.
Operations
Paya’s operations division is focused on delivering commercially differentiated customer and partner support to the integrated payments ecosystem. We achieve this goal by deploying a comprehensive set of user engagement tools to facilitate continued service excellence. These include a cloud-based telephony infrastructure and CRM system with a robust ticketing module, case management, chat bots, a customer accessible knowledgebase, and targeted call routing for premium service. The operations team represents a significant competitive advantage in core markets due to (1) large acquirers lacking service and implementation efforts tailored for the middle market 
and (2) software providers lacking payments expertise and scale to deliver the dedicated customer support that we offer.
Business Operations
•Advanced Client Solutions: Technical personnel with advanced payment knowledge and deep-rooted expertise in our integrations and solutions help partners and customers identify the right solutions during the sales process and throughout the lifetime of the relationship as they add new products and functionality.
•Implementation: White-glove onboarding for integration partners and large ERP end customers when needed; ensuring rapid activation for all new partners and customers to maximize the revenue opportunity for all parties.
•Partner Support and Premier Accounts: Dedicated team provides personalized service to top 40 partners and 400+ premier customers.
•Card and ACH Customer Care: Experienced front-line end-customer support teams that provide phone, ticket, chat and email support to customers for all payments related questions, including integrated solutions, ACH services and card processing.
•Government & Utilities Operations: Vertical specific implementation, relationship management, and customer support resources focused on serving municipal clients and government focused software partners.
Technology Operations
•Product Development: Our product development function manages the deployment and expansion of our payments product suite, primarily consisting of Paya Connect. Our developers work closely with our product managers to ensure they are actively addressing client demands and understanding trends in specific customer needs.
•Technology Infrastructure: Our technology infrastructure function ensures that systems are reliable, secure and fully operational while meeting industry and PCI-DSS security standards.
Security, Disaster Recovery and Back-up Systems
Paya has a robust technology security framework to manage and protect the large amount of information we store relating to customer transaction history and payment card information. We encrypt card information and customer data that is stored in our databases. Paya continues to deploy strong commercially acquired encryption methods. We have relationships with several third-party security technology vendors to disrupt threats including email threat protection (anti-phishing), endpoint security (anti-virus), network next-gen security, and firewalls. In addition to these measures, Paya has an external Security Operations Center which monitors for malicious activity 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This team is responsible for detecting intrusions, malware, and other events that could jeopardize data integrity, availability, and confidentiality. Upon detection, they work with Paya to protect against and contain the risk. We also leverage vendors for internal and external penetration testing, and for forensic incident response. Our security processes and procedures have been evaluated and validated by several third-party compliance tests:
•Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI-DSS”)
•Payment Application Data Security Standard (“PA-DSS”)
•National Automated Clearing House Association (“NACHA”)
•NIST Cybersecurity Framework
•Third party cyber assessments
In the summer of 2019, we completed a total platform modernization and infrastructure refresh. This included the relocation and upgrade of our physical infrastructure to a Tier 1 hardened location. In doing so, we significantly improved the performance of our platforms, raised our availability numbers, more efficiently satisfied current compliance mandates, and reduced our licensing profile. Within this new operating construct, we now have multiple levels of redundancy covering network, servers, storage, and applications via virtualization. We also modernized the network infrastructure of all our office locations and installed multiple redundant network paths, including last mile ISP and Telco. Our infrastructure roadmap includes further expansion into off premise Cloud infrastructure, leveraging Amazon Web Services ("AWS") and continuous dual location processing, removing the occurrence of service interruptions during scheduled maintenance periods. This will also dramatically reduce physical site risk.
Third Party Processors and Sponsor Banks
In the course of facilitating credit and debit card processing services, we rely on third parties to provide authorization, settlement and funding services in connection with our customers’ transactions. These institutions include third-party processors (such as Global Payments, FIS and Fiserv) and sponsor banks, who facilitate our access to the payment networks, such as Visa, Mastercard, and Discover. The processors and sponsor banks in turn have agreements with the payment networks, which permit them to route transaction information through their networks in exchange for fees.
For much of our credit and debit card payment volume, we engage Global Payments. Global Payments handles approximately two-thirds of our payment volume, providing authorization and settlement services to Paya, which include communicating with the credit card networks and providing funding instructions to the sponsor bank to facilitate the cash clearing process. Once a business accepts a payment transaction, Global Payments records the sale amount, type of transaction, location at which the transaction was processed, and other relevant information. We have built an entire value-added ecosystem around the transaction and control these aspects internally.
BMO Harris and Chesapeake Bank are our sponsor banks for debit and credit card transactions. Sponsor banks provide cash collection, and funding services for our card processing customers. Additionally, we adhere to the underwriting guidelines provided by our sponsor banks. Because we are not a “member bank” as defined by Visa and Mastercard, in order to process and settle these card transactions for our customers, we have entered into sponsorship agreements with member banks. Visa and Mastercard rules restrict us from performing funds settlement or accessing customer settlement funds.
Our sponsorship agreement enables us to route Visa and Mastercard transactions under the member bank’s control and under the member bank’s identification numbers to clear credit and signature debit card transactions through Visa and Mastercard.
Our sponsorship agreements with the member banks require, among other things, that we abide by the bylaws and regulations of the Visa and Mastercard networks. As of December 31, 2022, we have not been notified of any such issues by our sponsor banks, Visa or Mastercard.
In addition to bankcard processing, we process EFT transactions through the ACH network. We process ACH transactions, which require requesting customer-processed funds from the bank each day, receiving the funds, and then repaying those funds to the customer. We primary perform this service using the Enterprise ACH system (“eACH”) and the eMagnus system, our proprietary database and transaction processing system. eMagnus automatically calculates splits with our customers and determines the pay-out schedule. Owning the ACH processing engine represents a key differentiator for us as we control the end-to-end user experience and provide a payment-method agnostic experience to our partners. We have longstanding relationships with multiple originating depository financial institutions ("ODFIs"), including Wells Fargo, Fifth Third Bank, and America's 
Christian Credit Union ("ACCU"). ODFIs interface between the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve”) and ACH processors to facilitate payment flows.
Customers
Customer and Transaction Risk Management
We maintain a complete underwriting and risk monitoring management infrastructure with a dedicated team of underwriters, credit analysts, and risk and compliance management leads. Given that our core end markets are primarily focused on B2B and less focused on B2C and retail e-Commerce, we experience low levels of fraud and chargeback risk. Card brand networks generally allow chargebacks up to four months after the later of the date the transaction is processed or the delivery of the product or service to the cardholder. If the business incurring the chargeback is unable to fund the refund to the card issuing bank, we are required to do so. For the year ended December 31, 2022, Bad Debt Expense was $1.7 million.
Despite the low risk profile, we believe our security and risk offerings are differentiators in the marketplace. We utilize a comprehensive risk framework profile, which is essential in delivering low loss rates while maximizing approval rates and customer satisfaction. As such, our underwriting criteria is tailored towards our end markets and related business models. For example, we deploy vertical-specific monitoring relating to large ticket sizes and monthly patterns of utility and non-profit businesses.
Customer Underwriting
Our credit underwriting criteria consists of evaluating the nature of the business, end market, volume history, length of time between payment and delivery of goods or services, pricing, proposed transaction levels, and overall financial condition of the applicant. We may require cash or non-cash collateral as a condition for processing approval. These processes are documented and used for ongoing monitoring as the customer begins processing. Based on experience level, our underwriting staff is given various levels of autonomy to adjust transaction or volume thresholds, establish funding delays, establish daily discount funding and call-or-return collateral. These levels are originally set, reviewed, and signed off on by management. Our sponsor banks evaluate our customer underwriting policies and procedures to ensure compliance with card brand rules and regulations.
Risk Management/Transaction Monitoring
We take a sophisticated approach to risk management that involves intra-day reporting and monitoring of customer-level transaction activity to evaluate potential for credit and fraud risk. The risk management team reviews all unusual activity, which may include ticket size, rolling volume levels, refund and chargeback levels as well as authorization history. Risk management tools and reporting are reviewed daily to suspend unusual processing activity if sufficient abnormalities are observed. Accounts with suspended funds are investigated daily and the risk management team decides if any transactions should be held for further review. We believe this allows us to minimize credit and fraud risk by providing time to formally review the processing with our customer, the cardholders and the issuing banks.
Investigation and Loss Prevention
If a customer exceeds the thresholds established by our underwriting process, or if ongoing risk management processes identify suspicious activity or a potential breach of card brand rules and regulations or the terms of our customer agreement, we utilize a robust documentation and review process. The review will include the actions taken to reduce our exposure to loss and the exposure of our customer, which can start with requesting additional information and can be escalated to withholding or diverting funds, verifying delivery of merchandise or even deactivating the customer account. The financial condition of the business may also be considered during these investigations.
Collateral
As a condition for processing approval, we may require some customers to post collateral including certificates of deposits, letters of credit, cash, upfront or rolling reserves. This collateral is held in order to offset potential credit losses or risk liability that we may incur during the life of the relationship.
Competition
We compete with a variety of merchant acquirers that have different business models, go-to-market strategies and technical capabilities. Many merchant acquirers provide integrated payments solutions and/or related hardware to customers within our existing verticals. Our competition comes from a combination of niche players and horizontal acquirers which differ by individual vertical, including REPAY, i3 Verticals, Stripe, and the acquiring arms of FIS, FISERV and Global Payments. Our competitors also include banks, credit card providers, technology and ecommerce companies.
We believe the most significant competitive factors in the markets in which we compete are the following: (1) product offering, including depth of integration capabilities and ability to deliver differentiated value-added solutions; (2) customer service, including integration, transaction, and technology support for payors, customers, and software integration partners; (3) processing and technology reliability, and (4) transaction economics, including fees charged to customers and commission payouts to software integration partners.
Regulatory Compliance
Government Regulation and Payment Network Rules
We operate in an increasingly complex legal and regulatory environment. Our business and the products and services that we offer may be subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations, and the rules and standards of the card brand networks that we utilize to provide our electronic payment services, as more fully described below.
Dodd-Frank Act
The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, and the related rules and regulations have resulted in significant changes to the regulation of the financial services industry. Merchants are permitted to set minimum dollar amounts for the acceptance of credit cards and to offer discounts or incentives to entice consumers to pay with cash, checks, debit cards or credit cards, as the merchant prefers. There are certain prohibitions on card brand network exclusivity and merchant routing restrictions of debit card transactions. Additionally, the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act provides that the interchange fees that certain issuers charge merchants for debit transactions will be regulated by the Federal Reserve and must be “reasonable and proportional” to the cost incurred by the issuer in authorizing, clearing and settling the transactions. Rules released by the Federal Reserve in July 2011 to implement the Durbin Amendment mandate a cap on debit transaction interchange fees for issuers with assets of $10 billion or greater.
The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), which has assumed responsibility for most federal consumer protection laws, and the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which has the authority to determine whether any non-bank financial company, such as us, should be supervised by the Federal Reserve because it is systemically important to the U.S. financial system. Any new rules or regulations implemented by the CFPB or the Financial Stability Oversight Council or in connection with the Dodd-Frank Act that are applicable to us, or any changes that are adverse to us resulting from litigation brought by third parties challenging such rules and regulations, could increase our cost of doing business or limit permissible activities.
Privacy and Information Security Regulations
We provide services that may be subject to privacy laws and regulations of a number of jurisdictions. Relevant federal privacy laws may include the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, which applies directly to a broad range of 
financial institutions and indirectly, or in some instances directly, to companies that provide services to financial institutions, as a number of recent and novel state laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the "CCPA"), the California Privacy Rights Act (the "CPRA"), which went into effect in January 2023, and similar laws enacted in Connecticut, Colorado, Utah and Virginia, which go into effect at various times in 2023. These laws and regulations restrict the collection, processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal information, require notice to individuals of privacy practices and provide individuals with certain rights to prevent the use and disclosure of certain nonpublic or otherwise legally protected information. These laws also impose requirements for safeguarding and proper destruction of personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines. Our business may also be subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ("FCRA") and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 ("FACTA"), which regulate the use and reporting of consumer credit information and also impose disclosure requirements on entities who take adverse action based on information obtained from credit reporting agencies. In addition, there are state laws restricting the ability to collect and utilize certain types of personal information such as Social Security and driver’s license numbers and imposing secure disposal requirements for personal data. Certain state laws mandate businesses to implement reasonable data security measures. States are increasingly legislating data protection requirements for a broader list of personal data, such as biometric data, and are strengthening protections for students’ personal information. All fifty states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have now enacted data breach notification laws requiring businesses that experience a security breach of their computer databases that contain personal information to notify affected individuals, consumer reporting agencies and governmental agencies that possess data.
Each privacy law and regulation that applies to us could increase our cost of doing business or limit permissible activities.
Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Regulation
Our business is subject to U.S. federal anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, which we refer to collectively as the “BSA.” The BSA, among other things, requires money services businesses to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report large cash transactions and suspicious activity and maintain transaction records. We are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) that prohibit or restrict transactions to or from (or transactions dealing with) specified countries, their governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals, such as those who might be narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations. Similar anti-money laundering, counter terrorist financing and proceeds of crime laws apply to movements of currency and payments through electronic transactions and to dealings with persons specified on lists maintained by organizations similar to OFAC in several other countries and which may impose specific data retention obligations or prohibitions on intermediaries in the payment process. We have developed and continue to enhance compliance programs and policies to monitor and address related legal and regulatory requirements and developments.
Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices
We and many of our customers are subject to Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices. In addition, laws prohibiting these activities and other laws, rules and or regulations, including the Telemarketing Sales Act, may directly impact the activities of certain of our clients, and in some cases may subject us, as the customer's payment processor or provider of certain services, to investigations, fees, fines and disgorgement of funds if we are deemed to have aided and abetted or otherwise provided the means and instrumentalities to facilitate the illegal or improper activities of the customer through our services. Various federal and state regulatory enforcement agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission and the states attorneys general, have authority to take action against non-banks that engage in unfair or deceptive acts or practices or violate other laws, rules and regulations and to the extent we are processing payments or providing services for a customer that may be in violation of laws, rules and regulations, we may be subject to enforcement actions and as a result may incur losses and liabilities that may impact our business.
In addition, the CFPB has recently attempted to extend certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that prevent the employment of unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices (“UDAAP”) to payment processors. Though there is 
still litigation involving whether payment processing companies are subject to these requirements (and the extent of their application), these requirements may apply or be applicable in the future. UDAAPs could involve omissions or misrepresentations of important information to consumers or practices that take advantage of vulnerable consumers, such as elderly or low-income consumers.
Payment Network Rules and Standards
Payment networks establish their own rules and standards that allocate liabilities and responsibilities among the payment networks and their participants. These rules and standards, including the PCI-DSS, govern a variety of areas including the use of cards, the security features of cards, security standards for processing, data security and allocation of liability for certain acts or omissions including liability in the event of a data breach. The payment networks may change these rules and standards from time to time as they may determine in their sole discretion and with or without advance notice to their participants. These changes may be made for any number of reasons, including as a result of changes in the regulatory environment, to maintain or attract new participants, or to serve the strategic initiatives of the networks and may impose additional costs and expenses on or be disadvantageous to certain participants. Participants are subject to audit by the payment networks to ensure compliance with applicable rules and standards. The networks may fine, penalize or suspend the registration of participants for certain acts or omissions or the failure of the participants to comply with applicable rules and standards.
To provide our electronic payment services, we must be registered as a service provider with each of the payment networks. Because we are not a bank, we are not eligible for primary membership in certain payment networks, including Visa and Mastercard, and are therefore unable to directly access these networks. The operating regulations of certain payment networks, including Visa and Mastercard, require us to be sponsored by a member bank as a service provider. We are registered with certain payment networks, including Visa and Mastercard, through various sponsor banks. The agreements with our bank sponsors give them substantial discretion in approving certain aspects of our business practices including our solicitation, application and qualification procedures for clients and the terms of our agreements with clients. We are also subject to network operating rules and guidelines promulgated by NACHA relating to payment transactions we process using the ACH Network. Like the card networks, NACHA may update its operating rules and guidelines at any time, and we will be subject to these changes. These operating rules and guidelines allocate responsibility and liabilities to the various participants in the payment network. Recently, NACHA has focused upon data security and privacy responsibilities. We are subject to audit by our partner financial institutions for compliance with the rules and guidelines. Our sponsor financial institutions have substantial discretion in approving certain aspects of our business practices, including the terms of our agreements with our ACH processing clients.
Money Transmitter Regulation
We may be subject to various U.S. federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations governing money transmission and the issuance and sale of payment instruments, including some of the prepaid products we may sell. In the future, we may be subject to money transmitter regulation and may be required to obtain additional licenses and registrations which we may not be able to obtain.
In the United States, most states license money transmitters and issuers of payment instruments. These states not only regulate and control money transmitters, but they also license entities engaged in the transmission of funds. Many states exercise authority over the operations of our services related to money transmission and payment instruments and, as part of this authority, subject us to periodic examinations. Many states require, among other things, that proceeds from money transmission activity and payment instrument sales be invested in high-quality marketable securities before the settlement of the transactions or otherwise restrict the use and safekeeping of such funds. Such licensing laws also may cover matters such as regulatory approval of consumer forms, consumer disclosures and the filing of periodic reports by the licensee and require the licensee to demonstrate and maintain specified levels of net worth. Many states also require money transmitters, issuers of payment instruments, and their agents to comply with federal and/or state anti-money laundering laws and regulations.
Stored Value Services
Stored value cards, store gift cards and electronic gift certificates are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations, which may include laws and regulations related to consumer and data protection, licensing, consumer disclosures, escheat, anti-money laundering, banking, trade practices and competition and wage and employment. The customers who utilize the gift card processing products and services that we may sell may be subject to these laws and regulations. In the future, if we seek to expand these stored value card products and services, or as a result of regulatory changes, we may be subject to additional regulation and may be required to obtain additional licenses and registrations which we may not be able to obtain.
The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the “Card Act”) together with the Federal Reserve’s amended Regulation E, set forth the requirements with respect to general use prepaid gift cards, store gift cards and electronic certificates. These include certain prohibited features and revised disclosure obligations. Prepaid services may also be subject to the rules and regulations of Visa, Mastercard, Discover and American Express and other payment networks with which our clients and the card issuers do business. The customers who utilize the gift card processing products and services that we may sell are responsible for compliance with all applicable rules and requirements relating to their gift product program.
Additionally, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, or “FinCEN”, issued a final rule in July 2011 regarding the applicability of the BSA’s regulations to “prepaid access” products and services. This rulemaking clarified the anti-money laundering obligations for entities engaged in the provision and sale of prepaid services, such as prepaid gift cards. We are not registered with FinCEN based on our determination that our current products and services do not constitute a “prepaid program” as defined in the BSA and we are not a “provider” of prepaid access. We may in the future need to register with FinCEN as a “money services business-provider of prepaid access” in accordance with the rule based on changes to our products or services.
Other Regulation
We are subject to U.S. federal and state unclaimed or abandoned property (escheat) laws which require us to turn over to certain government authorities the property of others we hold that has been unclaimed for a specified period of time such as account balances that are due to a distribution partner or client following discontinuation of its relationship with us. The Housing Assistance Tax Act of 2008 requires certain merchant acquiring entities and third-party settlement organizations to provide information returns for each calendar year with respect to payments made in settlement of electronic payment transactions and third-party payment network transactions occurring in that calendar year. Reportable transactions are also subject to backup withholding requirements.
The foregoing is not an exhaustive list of the laws and regulations to which we are subject, and the regulatory framework governing our business is changing continuously.
Intellectual Property
Certain of our products and services are based on proprietary software and related payment systems solutions. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as employee and third-party non-disclosure, confidentiality, and other contractual arrangements to establish, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property rights in our technology, including with respect to our proprietary rights related to our products and services. In addition, we license technology from third parties that is integrated into some of our solutions.
We own several registered trademarks, including Paya, First Billing, FirstCloud, FirstUtility, and Stewardship and we have other pending applications. We also own multiple domain names, including www.paya.com.

Many of our employees are highly skilled in technical areas specific to payment technology and software solutions as well as delivery support, and many have deep knowledge of our core verticals and integrated payments. From time to time, we supplement our workforce with consultants or independent contractors, primarily in the information technology area, through contracted service arrangements.
Our employees are key to our success as a company, and we are committed to attracting, developing and retaining the best talent.

We also offer a variety of voluntary benefits that allow employees to select the options that meet their needs, including, critical illness coverage, medical and dependent care flexible spending accounts, health saving accounts, paid parental leave, and an employee assistance program.
Our executive management team and People Operations regularly review and update our talent strategy, monitoring a variety of data, including turnover, diversity, and tenure, to design and implement effective reward/recognition, training, development, succession, and benefit programs to meet the needs of our businesses and our employees. The Compensation Committee assists our Board in its oversight of human capital management including, corporate culture, diversity and inclusion, recruiting, retention, attrition, talent management, career development and progression, succession and employee relations.
The success of our business is connected to the well-being of our team members. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our team members worldwide.
