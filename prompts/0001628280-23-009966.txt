ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
Volta Inc. is a holding company for its wholly owned subsidiaries, Volta Charging Industries, LLC, Volta Charging, LLC, Volta Charging Services, LLC, Volta Canada Inc., Volta Charging Germany GmbH, Volta France SARL, Volta Rakko B.V., Rakko Holding B.V., and Volta Media, LLC (inactive) (collectively, the “Company” or “Volta”). Volta’s mission is to build the fueling infrastructure of the future. Volta’s vision is to create an electric vehicle (“EV”) charging network that capitalizes on and catalyzes the shift from gas cars to electric cars. Volta places its charging stations in high traffic public locations that driver and consumer behavior data suggest are stopping points in EV drivers' daily routines. Generally located near the front door entrances of the retail and other commercial facilities at these locations, the digital display screens on Volta's media enabled stations offer its media partners the opportunity to advertise to potential consumers, both EV drivers and non-EV drivers, just before they enter that facility. By both attracting EV drivers to a particular location to run an errand that was on their to-do list and providing a high impact advertising opportunity just before a purchasing decision may be made, Volta's charging stations allow it to enhance its site and media partners' core commercial interests.
Founded in 2010, Volta primarily owns, operates and maintains EV charging stations and has expanded its network across the United States to include over 3000 chargers across 31 states and territories that generated over 259,000 estimated charging sessions per month on average for year ended December 31, 2022, forming one of the most utilized charging networks in the United States on a station-by-station basis. On August 26, 2021 (“Closing Date”), Tortoise Acquisition Corp. II (“Tortoise Corp II”) consummated the reverse recapitalization contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement ("Reverse Recapitalization"), by and among Tortoise Corp II, SNPR Merger Sub I, Inc., SNPR Merger Sub II, LLC, and Legacy Volta (the "Business Combination Agreement"). On the Closing Date, and in connection with the closing of the Business Combination Agreement (the “Closing”), Tortoise Corp II was renamed Volta Inc. and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “VLTA”. The Company's public warrants also trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “VLTA WS” (the "Public Warrants"). Additionally, in 2021, Volta expanded its international footprint, opening business offices in Paris, France, and Berlin, Germany, and a technical development office in Montreal, Canada and commenced installation of its first stations in Europe. 
Volta’s business entails partnering with real estate and retail partners with national and regional multi-site portfolios of commercial and retail properties, as well as communities, municipalities, and local business owners, to locate and deploy its EV charging stations in premier locations. These site hosts span a wide array of industries and locations, including retail centers, grocery stores, pharmacies, movie theaters, parking lots, healthcare/medical facilities, municipalities, sport and entertainment venues, parks and recreation areas, restaurants, schools and universities, certain transit and fueling locations and office buildings and other locations. Volta generally signs long-term contracts to locate its charging stations at site host properties and grows its footprint over time as its station utilization justifies further capital investment in its EV charging infrastructure. Volta also sells charging stations to certain business partners, while continuing to perform related installation, operation and maintenance services. For both Volta-owned and partner-owned media-enabled charging stations, Volta sells media display time on the charging stations’ digital displays to its media and advertising partners. 
Volta’s business model includes pay-per-use by the driver across a portion of its direct current fast charging ("DCFC") stations, as well as free charging services to drivers who use its Level 2 charging stations as well as select DCFC stations (meaning that drivers can charge their EVs at no cost to them). Volta’s network has a distinguished business model among other competitors in the EV charging industry, as it can draw on several sources of revenue to build earlier and stronger unit economics than other solutions currently available in the market, by tapping into multiple commercial opportunities, consisting of the sale of advertising content on its charging station digital displays to its commercial partners, installation, operation and maintenance services related to its charging stations, license or service fees from the licensing of Volta’s proprietary software tools, the sale of low-carbon fuel standard (“LCFS”) credits and fees associated with pay-for-use by the driver charging services.
Volta focuses on optimizing its network deployment for capital and electrical grid efficiency using a data-driven approach powered by its PredictEVTM  tool. Volta is building a network that has at its core the objective of delivering the most electric miles per dollar invested.
Recent Developments
Agreement and Plan of Merger
On January 17, 2023, Volta entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Shell USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Shell”), and SEV Subsidiary, Inc., a Delaware corporation, a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Shell ("Merger Sub"). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Volta, with Volta continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shell.
Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing
On November 23, 2022, Volta was notified by the NYSE that it is not in compliance with Section 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual because the average closing price of the Company’s Class A common stock was less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period. The notice did not result in the immediate delisting of the Company's Class A common stock from the NYSE.
The Company notified the NYSE that it intends to cure the stock price deficiency and return to compliance with the NYSE continued listing standard. The Company can regain compliance at any time within the six-month period following receipt of the NYSE notice if on the last trading day of any calendar month during the cure period the Company has a closing share price of at least $1.00 and an average closing share price of at least $1.00 over the 30 trading-day period ending on the last trading day of that month. The Company intends to consider available alternatives, including, but not limited to, a reverse stock split, subject to stockholder approval no later than at the Company’s next annual meeting of stockholders, if necessary to cure the stock price non-compliance. Under the NYSE’s rules, if the Company determines that it will cure the stock price deficiency by taking an action that will require stockholder approval at its next annual meeting of stockholders, the price condition will be deemed cured if the price promptly exceeds $1.00 per share, and the price remains above that level for at least the following 30 trading days.
The Company's Class A common stock will continue to be listed and trade on the NYSE during this period, subject to the Company’s compliance with other NYSE continued listing standards. The notice from the NYSE does not affect ongoing business operations of the Company or its reporting requirements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").
Department of Energy Loan Programs Office Invitation
On March 20, 2023, Volta received a letter from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (“DOE”) Title XVII Innovative Clean Energy Loan Guarantee Program under the Renewable Energy Projects and Efficient Energy Projects Solicitation No. DE-SOL-0007154 inviting Volta to enter into the due diligence process. Volta first applied for a loan under this program on August 2, 2021. The DOE Loan Programs Office (“LPO”) invitation includes LPO performing its due diligence of Volta’s electric vehicle charging station installation project.
Volta’s management believes that the due diligence stage would likely take between three and six months. There is no assurance that Volta’s application will proceed beyond the due diligence stage and receive a conditional commitment or an eventual loan.
Volta’s Solution
Volta’s solution is to provide a differentiated model that uses media and EV charging to draw drivers to Volta's site partners' locations and influence purchasing or other behavior. By choosing Volta charging stations, charging becomes more than just an amenity that a site host can offer its customers — it can serve as an independent driver of revenue, loyalty and driver engagement for site hosts. Volta’s content partners similarly benefit from access to unique locations served by Volta’s EV charging stations, reaching audiences when they are about to enter retail or 
commercial facilities. Finally, Volta believes its EV charging stations' role in slowing climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions by enabling EV transportation closely aligns with the values of its site hosts, content partners and the drivers that use Volta chargers.
Volta’s principal products and services are its EV charging stations and related services, including its content delivery activities for its media and advertising partners. Volta’s EV charging equipment consists of a managed network of Alternate Current (“AC”) and DCFC chargers equipped with digital displays (which Volta refers to as its “content-driven” or “media-enabled” charging stations) and chargers without digital displays. Volta’s EV charging network is facilitated by proprietary software that operates, maintains, and monitors its EV charging stations and associated charging data. Volta remotely monitors and manages its EV charging stations to assist with driver engagement at host sites to provide EV drivers with vital station information, including charger location and availability. Volta’s media-enabled charging stations also provide its commercial partners with an extensive network of digital displays in prime locations that drivers visit on a day-to-day basis.
Competitive Strengths
Volta’s competitive strengths include the following:
•Market opportunity that capitalizes on the burgeoning demand for EV charging stations. The macroeconomic shift to electric mobility provides a significant opportunity to redefine how drivers and businesses view EV charging infrastructure, positioning Volta to take advantage of a compelling disruption story in a new addressable market in the United States and internationally that is not yet fully saturated.
•Some of the highest charging utilization among competitors. Driven by its differentiated business model, Volta’s well-located charging stations are among the most utilized in the EV charging industry on a station basis, providing Volta with a competitive advantage in further expanding its footprint with site hosts and securing additional commercial partners, enabling further expansion and growth as Volta’s network scales.
•Revenue diversity and unit economics. Volta’s charging stations can deliver multiple revenue streams, currently consisting of the sale of advertising content on its charging station digital displays to its commercial partners, installation, operation and maintenance services related to its charging stations, license or service fees from the licensing of Volta’s proprietary software tools, the sale of LCFS credits and, through fees associated with pay-for-use charging services, which Volta plans to expand upon in the future, enabling Volta to maximize its deployment of capital to achieve compelling value per unit and dollars per electric mile delivered. In addition, Volta also sells content-driven EV charging stations to select business partners and continues to perform the related installation, operation and maintenance services, generating recurring revenue while retaining the exclusive right to sell media display time on the media-enabled charging stations for the duration of the contract term.
•Robust partnerships create ample opportunity for growth. Volta has robust relationships with numerous site partners with national and international real estate portfolios. Volta has master service agreements with a number of such partners, which provide the framework for deploying Volta charging stations to such national and international partners’ sites by establishing a mutual agreement with such partners to work with Volta to agree upon such partner’s sites for installation of Volta charging stations with the execution of a specific further agreement governed by the terms of the master service agreement. Volta continues to pursue commercial relationships under both master service agreements and site-specific agreements as part of its ordinary course of business and believes these opportunities will lead to growth as Volta deploys additional capital to scale its network.
•Differentiated EV charging business model. Volta believes its differentiated business model will allow it to leverage the benefits delivered to its site hosts and commercial partners to continue to grow its business at even greater rates as the Volta network scales. More site hosts could lead to more chargers, more paid charging revenue, more screens and a continuously expanding network opportunity for Volta’s content partners.
•International presence. In 2021, Volta opened offices in France, Germany and Canada and the Netherlands in 2022. The Company deployed chargers to meet the needs of the increasing EV driver population in Europe and introduce its differentiated business model. 
•Experienced management team. As Volta has grown, it has assembled a talented leadership team with extensive industry experience who are dedicated to continuing to innovate and shape how drivers view and experience EV charging and to leverage the shift to electric mobility for the benefit of Volta’s commercial partners.
Suppliers and Service Providers
Volta has invested in and maintains long-term relationships with suppliers and service providers. Volta designs its EV charging stations in-house with the assistance of professional design consultants and outsources production to contract manufacturers. At this stage of the industry, equipment can be unique to each supplier with respect to components and aftermarket maintenance and warranty services. Volta relies on a limited number of suppliers and manufacturers, and in some cases only a single supplier for some components, for the manufacture and supply of its charging stations. Peerless-AV ("Peerless"), which assembles Volta’s charging stations, was Volta’s principal supplier for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, accounting for 53% and 64% of Volta’s supply-related expenditures for such periods, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, no other supplier or manufacturer for the supply or manufacture of Volta’s charging stations accounted for greater than 10% of Volta’s supply-related expenditures for the applicable period. 
Volta’s and Peerless' supply relationship is governed by a Supply Agreement under which Volta has the right to place orders for the purchase of charging stations and related equipment (the “Peerless Supply Agreement”). The materials purchased from Peerless pursuant to any purchase order are covered by terms within the Peerless Supply Agreement customary for these types of arrangements, including customary warranty, delivery, payment and liability provisions. The Peerless Supply Agreement requires Volta to purchase at least 60 and no more than 200 charging stations a quarter unless otherwise agreed by Volta and Peerless. The Peerless Supply Agreement may be terminated by either party by notice given at least thirty days before its annual renewal date, by Peerless on six months’ notice, and at any time by the giving of not less than 30-days’ notice upon breach by a party (subject to customary cure rights), except that termination of the Peerless Supply Agreement will not terminate any then-existing purchase order (other than due to breach by the applicable party, subject to customary cure rights). The Peerless Supply Agreement does not require Volta to deal exclusively with Peerless.
In addition, Volta is typically responsible for the installation of its charging stations at its partners’ sites. These installations are generally performed by electrical and civil contractors, consistent and in accordance with accepted industry practices. Those electrical and civil contractors are engaged and managed by Volta under the oversight of Volta’s construction project managers. To facilitate its installation and maintenance activities, Volta has formed relationships with construction and maintenance companies that have significant experience building and maintaining EV charging sites.
Competition
EV Charging
The EV charging market is relatively new and is increasingly competitive with many newcomers. Volta currently faces competition from a number of companies. Volta believes its current competitors to its EV charging owner-operator business activities include EVgo Services LLC, Electrify America LLC, Allego N.V., Tesla Inc., and Rivian Automotive Inc. There are also many other large and small EV charging companies that offer non-networked or “basic” chargers that have limited customer leverage but could provide a low-cost solution for basic charger needs in commercial and retail locations, such as Pod Point Limited, EVConnect, Inc., Power Dot SA, SemaConnect, Inc., and Engie SA, as well EV charging equipment manufacturers that also compete with Volta, like ChargePoint, Inc., EVBox Group, FLO Services USA Inc., Revel Transit Inc., and Blink Charging Co., in addition to charging networks being developed by original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), such as IONITY GmbH, and utilities, such as EDF Group, or in partnership with any of the aforementioned competitors. 
The principal competitive factors in the EV charging industry include the number of stations in a network; capital deployment efficiency; number of revenue lines and diversity of revenue opportunities, charger utilization and pricing to drivers; charger connectivity to EVs and ability to charge all models and standards; charger network reliability, scale and local density; charger locations and accessibility; speed of charging relative to expected vehicle dwell times at the location; software-enabled service offerings and overall business partner and driver user 
experience; operator brand, track record and reputation; access to equipment vendors and service providers; installation expertise and costs; brand recognition and reputation; mobile application interface and ease of use; partnerships with OEMs; and policy incentives. Large initial stage markets require significant early capital expenditures, engagement across verticals and driver engagement to gain market share and a continued effort to scale product and service offerings, channels, installers, teams and processes. There are also competitors who may have limited funding, experience or commitment to quality assurance, which could cause poor experiences, hampering overall EV adoption or trust in any particular provider of charging services. Volta believes these additional competitors may struggle with gaining the necessary network traction but could gain momentum in the future. Further, Volta’s current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with different commercial objectives and imperatives and greater available resources.
Volta believes it has a competitive advantage in delivering charging services driven by its differentiated business model, EV charging station design, charging station placement, network tools and the additional value Volta’s charging stations can deliver to its site hosts and business partners by combining content display offerings with charging services to drive higher utilization as compared to Volta’s competitors.
Content
The place-based digital media industry is fragmented, consisting of a few traditional companies operating on a national and international basis, such as Outfront Media, Inc., Amscreen, Clear Channel Outdoor, Lamar, JCDecaux, Intersection and GSTV, as well as newer, digitally-forward, omni-channel platforms like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and hundreds of smaller regional and local companies operating a limited number of displays in a single or a few local geographic markets. Volta competes with all of these companies for its content customers. Volta also competes with other content, including broadcast and cable television, radio, podcasts, OTT print media, internet and mobile and direct mail marketers, within their respective markets. In addition, Volta competes with a wide variety of out-of-home media, including media in shopping centers, grocery stores, movie theaters, transit locations and sports and entertainment venues. Advertisers compare relative costs of available media, cost per thousand impressions of a piece of content, the efficacy of the media, as well as markets, locations and audiences, particularly when delivering a message to customers with distinct demographic characteristics. In competing with other content, Volta intends to rely on its differentiated product and its media-enabled charging station placement which can provide access to a high-value audience, historically unavailable locations, an uncluttered media experience, the opportunity to influence purchase and brand decisions immediately prior to site visitors entering a retail environment, a compelling halo effect for brands desiring alignment with sustainability and the growing ability to prove efficacy of digital content in the real world.
Governmental Regulation and Incentives
Government regulations for installation and operation of EV charging stations and place-based media content vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may include, but are not limited to, permitting and sign code requirements, inspection requirements, licensing of contractors, certifications, environmental requirements, health and safety requirements and restrictions around digital display placement and content.
Compliance with such regulations is an important aspect of Volta’s ability to continue its operations and avoid additional costs and installation delays for its EV charging stations. The descriptions that follow are summaries and should be read in conjunction with the texts of the regulations described herein, which are subject to change. The descriptions do not purport to describe all present and proposed regulations affecting Volta’s business. Volta is not currently materially dependent on any government programs supporting EV technology.
Grants and Incentives
Volta continuously pursues public grants, subsidies and incentives to reduce its capital expenditures. This includes the $7.5 billion that has been allocated to deploy 500,000 EV chargers by 2030 as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law ("BIL"), the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program ("NEVI") which includes $5 billion to build out a national electric vehicle charging network and the Inflation Reduction Act ("IRA") which includes nearly $400 billion in federal funding to clean energy that will be delivered through a mix of tax incentives, grants and loan guarantees. To this end, Volta has dedicated, and plans to further dedicate, a number of internal and external resources to monitor, apply for and utilize available grant, subsidy and incentive funding for the 
development of charging infrastructure on a state, local, national and international level. Volta may inform its network expansion and local build plans based on expected timing for and availability of funding of this type. Volta has received grants from a number of third parties.
Volta intends to continue to seek additional grants, rebates, subsidies and incentives as an effective avenue to reduce its capital investment in the promotion, purchase and installation of charging stations where applicable.
Government Regulations to Enhance EV Adoption
Some governments provide incentives to end users and purchasers of EVs and EV charging stations in the form of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives, such as payments for regulatory credits, as discussed in more detail below. The EV market relies on these governmental rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives to significantly lower the effective costs associated with EVs and EV charging stations.
For example, in the U.S., the regulations mandated by the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (“CAFE”) standards set the average new vehicle fuel economy, as weighted by sales, that a manufacturer’s fleet must achieve. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has established vehicle carbon dioxide emissions standards through model year 2026 for light-duty vehicles; however, the Biden Administration has announced plans to reconsider these standards and the EPA has restored California’s authority to establish its own more stringent standards, which several other states have elected to follow. Although Volta is not a car manufacturer, and thus not directly subject to the CAFE standards, such standards may still indirectly affect Volta’s business. The adoption of more stringent standards may create further incentives for vehicle manufacturers to increase their EV offerings, which would likely result in increased demand for charging services. Additionally, several states, such as California, Massachusetts and New York, have adopted or are considering adopting bans on the sale of internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035 and a number of European countries, including France, Norway and the United Kingdom, have adopted or are considering adopting bans on the sale of new internal combustion engine vehicles between 2025 and 2040.
Regulatory Credits
Volta earns various tradable regulatory credits, in particular California’s LCFS credits, as well as carbon credits under comparable LCFS programs in other states. Volta earns credits for the kilowatt-hours distributed by its stations and, in certain cases, the installation of DCFC infrastructure under California’s Fast Charging Infrastructure program. Volta earns revenue from the sale of these credits, and expects to continue to sell future credits, to entities that generate deficits under the LCFS programs and are obligated to purchase the credits and use them to offset their deficits or emissions, primarily petroleum refiners and marketers, and other entities that can use the credits to comply with the program requirements, or through exchanges. Volta actively seeks to maximize the number of regulatory credits generated per kilowatt hour of energy dispensed. Volta’s management is actively monitoring proposed and newly enacted LCFS programs in other jurisdictions (including, for example, states, such as Massachusetts, New York, Colorado and Washington) as potential future revenue streams. The availability of such credits depends on continued governmental support for these programs and regulatory frameworks that make it possible for Volta to participate in these credit markets. There is no guarantee that such credits will continue to be available for sale or that regulatory restrictions would not be imposed on the proceeds from the sale of such credits in the future. Additionally, to the extent government incentives result in increased build-out of electric or other low-carbon fuel dispensing infrastructure that also produce LCFS or similar regulatory credits, the revenue received from the sale of such credits may diminish.
Other EV Charging Regulations
On December 16, 2019, California adopted amendments to the state’s electric vehicle supply equipment specifications that prohibit, or will prohibit, public-charging operators from billing customers by the minute within the state. The prohibition on per-minute billing currently applies to all new AC chargers installed or replaced on or after January 1, 2021 and to new DCFCs installed or replaced on or after January 1, 2023. Chargers installed before 2021 can continue time-based billing until 2031 for AC chargers and 2033 for DCFCs.
California, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia, Washington and the District of Columbia have determined that companies that sell EV 
charging services to the public will not be regulated as utilities. While these individual state determinations are not binding on any other regulator or jurisdiction, they demonstrate a trend in the way states view the nascent EV charging industry. Other jurisdictions are in the process of adopting such reforms.
Manufacturing and Safety Regulations
Volta does not directly manufacture or assemble its charging stations; however, Volta may still be subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended (“OSHA”) in the United States and occupational health and safety regulations in Europe. OSHA establishes certain employer responsibilities, including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury, compliance with standards promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and various record keeping, disclosure and procedural requirements. Various standards, including standards for notices of hazards, safety in excavation and demolition work and the handling of asbestos, may apply to Volta’s operations. 
In addition, in the U.S., the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (“NEMA”) is the association of electrical equipment and medical imaging manufacturers. NEMA provides a forum for the development of technical standards that are in the best interests of the industry and users, advocacy of industry policies on legislative and regulatory matters, and collection, analysis, and dissemination of industry data.
Several states, including California, have adopted variations of the national guidelines governing electric vehicle fueling systems set forth in the National Institute of Standards and Technology Handbook 44, which provide safety, pricing, labeling, testing, certification, and other requirements for electric vehicle charging stations that charge fees to users for the delivery of electricity. As Volta introduces charging fees for the receipt of electricity from its stations, the regulatory burden will likely increase and Volta will likely need to expend additional resources to meet such increased regulatory burden. A failure of Volta to timely meet regulatory requirements in its design or implementation of stations or in implementing updates to its stations that are already installed in order to meet these regulatory requirements could delay Volta’s ability to implement fees for users and have a material impact on its business.
Waste Handling and Disposal
Volta is subject to environmental laws and regulations regarding the handling and disposal of hazardous substances and solid wastes, including electronic wastes and batteries. These laws regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and may impose strict, joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. For instance, the U.S.’s Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release of the hazardous substance occurred as well as companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and seek to recover costs incurred from the responsible classes of persons. In the course of ordinary operations, Volta, through third parties and contractors, may handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA and similar state statutes and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites as which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment.
Volta may also be subject to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) in the U.S. and comparable state statutes for the generation or disposal of solid wastes, which may include hazardous wastes. RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, but in particular, imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. Provided that certain requirements are met, certain components of our charging stations may be excluded from RCRA’s hazardous waste regulations; however, if these components do not meet all established requirements for the exclusion to apply, or if the requirements for the exclusion change, Volta may be required to treat such products as hazardous waste which are subject to more rigorous and costly 
disposal requirements. Any changes in the laws or regulations, or any changes in Volta’s ability to qualify the materials used for exclusions under such laws and regulations, could adversely affect Volta’s operating expenses.
In Europe, Volta may be subject to additional environmental regulations. 
Place-Based Media Industry Regulations
The place-based media and outdoor media industry is subject to governmental regulation and enforcement at all levels of government in the United States and Europe. These regulations have a significant impact on the outdoor media industry and may have an impact on Volta’s content sales activities.
In particular, construction, repair, maintenance, lighting, upgrading, height, size, spacing, the location and permitting of outdoor digital displays and the use of new technologies for changeable displays, such as digital displays, are regulated by governments, and, from time to time, governments have prohibited or significantly limited the construction of new outdoor media displays or structures. Since digital displays have been developed and introduced relatively recently into the market on a large scale, existing regulations that currently do not apply to them by their terms could be revised or new regulations could be enacted to impose greater restrictions on digital displays due to alleged concerns over aesthetics or driver safety.
In recent years, outdoor media also has become the subject of other targeted taxes and fees and, from time to time, legislation has been introduced attempting to impose taxes on revenue from outdoor media or for the right to use outdoor media assets. In particular, a number of U.S. governments have implemented or initiated taxes, fees and registration requirements in an effort to decrease or restrict the number of outdoor signs and/or to raise revenue. Several U.S. jurisdictions have imposed such taxes as a percentage of outdoor media revenue generated in that jurisdiction or based on the size and type of display technology. These laws may affect prevailing competitive conditions in specified markets in a variety of ways. Such laws may reduce Volta’s expansion opportunities or may increase or reduce competitive pressure from other members of the outdoor media industry.
In addition, restrictions on the use of outdoor media to display certain products, services or other content have been imposed by laws and regulations. For example, in the U.S. and Germany, tobacco products have been effectively banned from outdoor media in most jurisdictions and state and local governments in some cases limit outdoor advertising of alcohol. Further, certain municipalities may limit issue-based outdoor advertising or place restrictions on advertising off-site or off-premises products or services. Additional restrictions on outdoor media of certain products and services are or may be imposed by laws and regulations.
Intellectual Property
Volta protects its intellectual property and proprietary rights through patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and unfair competition laws, augmented by its own confidentiality protocols. Volta undertakes actions as necessary to ensure that its proprietary rights are protected while at the same time respecting the intellectual property rights of other persons.
Volta has a number of issued design patents, pending design patent applications, issued utility patents and pending utility patent applications in both the United States and internationally. Volta continues to regularly assess opportunities for seeking patent protection for those aspects of its technology, designs and methodologies that it believes provide a meaningful competitive advantage.
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, Volta had 208 total employees, comprised of 176 full-time employees in the U.S., 6 full-time employees in Canada and 26 full-time employees in Europe.
