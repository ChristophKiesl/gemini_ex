Item 1. Business.
Overview
Williams Industrial Services Group Inc. was incorporated in 2001 under the name “Global Power Equipment Group Inc.” under the laws of the State of Delaware and became the successor to GEEG Holdings, LLC, which was formed as a Delaware limited liability company in 1998. Effective June 29, 2018, Global Power Equipment Group Inc. changed its name to Williams Industrial Services Group Inc. (together with its wholly owned subsidiaries, “Williams,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our,” unless the context indicates otherwise) to better align its name with the Williams business (as defined below), and our stock now trades on the NYSE American LLC (the “NYSE American”) under the ticker symbol “WLMS.” Williams has been safely helping plant owners and operators enhance asset value for more than 50 years. We provide a broad range of construction, maintenance, and support services to customers in energy, power, and industrial end markets. Our mission is to be the preferred provider of construction, maintenance, and specialty services through commitment to superior safety performance, focus on innovation, and dedication to delivering unsurpassed value to our customers.
Our Restructuring 
We completed the restructuring of our Company in 2018. Beginning in 2016, we shifted our strategy to become a preferred provider of construction, maintenance, and specialty services, to exit all product manufacturing businesses and to use the proceeds from the sales to reduce and restructure our term debt. To effect this change, in the third quarter of 2017, we made the decision to exit and divest substantially all the operating assets and liabilities of our Mechanical Solutions segment, which we completed in the fourth quarter of 2017, as described below. Additionally, we made the decision to exit and sell our Electrical Solutions segment (which was comprised solely of Koontz-Wagner, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company) in the fourth quarter of 2017. We determined that these two segments met the definition of discontinued operations, and, as a result, they (including TOG Manufacturing Company, Inc. and TOG Holdings, Inc., which were sold in July 2016) have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Additionally, in January 2017, we sold the stock of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Hetsco Holdings, Inc. and Hetsco, Inc. (collectively, “Hetsco”). However, the Mechanical Solutions and Electrical Solutions segments were the only components of the business that qualified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Unless otherwise specified, the financial information and discussion in this Form 10-K are based on our continuing operations (previously referred to as our Services segment); they exclude any results of our discontinued operations. Please refer to “Note 5—Changes in Business” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for additional information.

In spite of our efforts, which included retaining financial advisors to sell all or part of Koontz-Wagner’s operations, inside or outside of a federal bankruptcy or state court proceeding (including Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”)), the proposed disposition did not progress as planned due, primarily, to the absence of viable bids in the sale process, the inability of Koontz-Wagner to fund its ongoing operations or obtain financing to do so, and Koontz-Wagner’s deteriorating financial performance. As a result, on July 11, 2018, Koontz-Wagner filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 7 of Title 11 of the Bankruptcy Code with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. The filing was for Koontz-Wagner only, not for the Company as a whole, and was separate and distinct from the Williams business and operations.
On October 11, 2017, we sold substantially all of the operating assets and liabilities of our Mechanical Solutions segment and used a portion of the $40.9 million net proceeds to pay down $34.0 million of our outstanding debt and related fees, including full repayment of the first-out loan, provided for by the first amendment to the Initial Centre Lane Facility (as defined below) for an additional aggregate principal amount of $10.0 million and the upfront fee on the 4.5-year senior secured term loan facility, entered into June 16, 2017, with an affiliate of Centre Lane Partners, LLC (“Centre Lane”) as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, and the other lenders from time to time party thereto (as amended, the “Initial Centre Lane Facility”). Additionally, on October 31, 2017, we completed the sale of our manufacturing facility in Mexico and auctioned the remaining production equipment and other assets for net proceeds of $3.6 million, of which $1.9 million was used to reduce the principal amount of the Initial Centre Lane Facility. The remaining proceeds from such sales were used to fund working capital requirements.
As a result of the sale of our Mechanical Solutions segment and the bankruptcy of Koontz-Wagner, we review financial information presented on a company-wide basis. Therefore, as of December 31, 2020, we concluded that we continue to have a single reporting segment which is comprised of Williams Industrial Services Group, LLC (collectively with Williams Plant Services, LLC, Williams Specialty Services, LLC, Williams Industrial Services, LLC, Williams Industrial Services Canada, LTD, the “Williams business”), as we did as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. 
In 2018, we implemented major cost reduction initiatives to reduce our overhead costs, including restructuring and consolidating our corporate functions, and began working on a comprehensive strategic plan to grow and improve our business, which was finalized in early 2019. Our strategy has been focused on developing a comprehensive strategic plan to grow and improve our operations, strengthen our core competencies, aggressively manage working capital, and reduce costs in order to improve liquidity and reduce debt. 
In order to improve our efforts to satisfy our working capital requirements in 2020, we refinanced our then-existing credit facilities on January 13, 2020 and we successfully completed our registered offering of subscription rights to purchase shares of our common stock to existing holders of our common stock (the “Rights Offering”), the offer period for which expired March 2, 2020, pursuant to which we issued 5,384,615 shares of our common stock and received net proceeds of $6.5 million. Further to our efforts to more efficiently fund our working capital requirements, reduce our cost of capital, and accommodate our strategic growth initiatives, in December 2020, we entered into new credit facilities which included senior secured term loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to $50.0 million (collectively, the “Term Loan”), consisting of a $35.0 million closing date term loan facility and up to $15.0 million of borrowing under a delayed draw term loan facility with EICF Agent LLC (“EICF”), an affiliate of Energy Impact Partners, as agent, and CION Investment Corporation as a lender and co-lead arranger; and a senior secured asset-based revolving line of credit of up to $30.0 million (the “PNC Facility”) with PNC Bank, National Association (“PNC”), which refinanced and replaced our previous credit facilities. For additional information, please refer to “Note 11—Debt” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.
Our common stock began trading on the NYSE American on February 22, 2021 under the ticker symbol “WLMS”. This was the final stage in our restructuring process, and we believe it provides us the opportunity to have increased visibility from a significantly broader pool of investors. 
Our success in our operations is based on our effectiveness in using estimating and planning technologies, deploying rigorous project management techniques, initiating various process improvement projects, and employing experienced industry-recognized sales professionals. We expect to continue to leverage the strength of the Williams brand, capitalize on our industry knowledge and customer relationships and safely provide timely, reliable services for our customers to grow revenue. We are excited about Williams’ anticipated future growth potential, the foundation of which is adherence to our core values. We plan to continue to successfully execute our strategic plan with discipline, passion, and persistence. We believe we are well positioned to grow our business, and to realize the operating leverage our restructuring has created.
We are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business, including its impact on our customers, employees, suppliers, and vendors. The effects of COVID-19 have impacted some of our projects; for 

3




instance, in July 2020, we experienced an increase in COVID-19 cases at a nuclear plant construction project in Georgia, in response to which we began to administer and enforce stricter safety precautions. In April 2020, we experienced a temporary suspension for projects in New York which required a phased reopening. Although projects in New York caused slight delays, the job sites were fully functional by the beginning of June 2020. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2020, we experienced a delay in a nuclear project and an outage cycle in Louisiana, and have experienced a slow-down in business development activities and bid opportunities, particularly on the eastern shore of the Lake Huron area in Ontario, Canada due to COVID-19. Although the majority of stay-at-home orders were phased-out by the end of the second quarter of 2020, we are still experiencing impacts associated with the COVID-19 project specific protocols. While the Company has not yet experienced a material negative impact on its operational results, these project specific requirements are expected to remain in place for the foreseeable future, which will continue to impact project schedules and workflow going forward. Our results of operations for 2020 were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we anticipate that our future results of operations will continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, but at this time do not expect that the impact from the COVID-19 outbreak will have a material negative effect on the Company’s business. However, given the speed and frequency of continuously evolving developments and inherent uncertainty with respect to this pandemic, including the duration and severity of the pandemic and the related length of its impact on the economy, we cannot provide any assurance that such impacts will not grow and become material to our liquidity or financial position and currently cannot predict the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. For additional information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors--Risk Factors Related to our Operations”. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected, and may further adversely affect, our business, operating and financial results, and liquidity, and could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition in the future.

● | Canada Nuclear. We currently only perform professional services for power companies in Canada but are beginning to bid for maintenance, modification, and construction services in order to expand our geographic market reach throughout North America. Two power companies in Canada are performing major plant refurbishments and upgrades to extend the lives of several operating units. Our experience working on nuclear plants in the U.S. is directly translatable to work being performed on the plants in Canada. Further, additional vendors from outside of Canada are needed to provide the experience and capacity required to perform this work. Therefore, we developed a strategic growth initiative to pursue nuclear plant maintenance, modifications, and construction in Canada. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Nuclear Decommissioning. We provide decommissioning services to U.S. nuclear stations that have been retired. Several U.S. nuclear stations have already been shut down, and several more shutdowns are planned. After shutdown, the plants must be decommissioned. This process takes many years. We are working with the owner and prime contractor for decommissioning work on two sites and are targeting the decommissioning market as it grows. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Nuclear Power Plant Services and New Nuclear Power Plant Construction. We are one of a limited number of companies qualified to perform comprehensive services anywhere in U.S. nuclear power facilities under the rules issued by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the “NRC”). Additionally, we are one of only a small number of contractors with a qualified and audited Nuclear Quality Assurance (“NQA-1”) Program, which is required to perform construction of “Safety” related systems in new nuclear power plants. Through our Appendix B Program and other programs, we provide training, certifications, and ongoing safety monitoring to all of our employees working at nuclear sites and have been one of the leading providers of coatings at U.S. nuclear facilities for almost 40 years. Under the rules issued by the NRC, owners of nuclear facilities must qualify contractors by requiring the contractors to demonstrate that they will comply with NRC regulations on quality assurance, reporting of safety issues, security and control of personnel access and conduct. For the majority of our maintenance and project work, we directly hire the labor and provide the management and supervision to perform the work directly for the owner. In some cases, we act as a general contractor and subcontract portions of the work or, alternatively, subcontract our services to full scope engineering, procurement, and construction (“EPC”) firms or general contractor firms. We maintain good relationships with the utilities, the EPC firms, the general contractor firms, and relevant engineering firms. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We provide these services throughout the U.S. and Canada, primarily on a direct hire basis, with experienced craft laborers who are directed and managed by an experienced team of supervisors and project managers across our network. We also act as a general contractor where we manage multiple subcontractors and, in other cases, we are retained as a subcontractor on a project. Our flexible staffing model enables us to meet seasonal and outage demand without being restricted by internal capacity limitations, thereby minimizing our fixed costs.
We bid against other contractors based on customer specifications. Fixed-price contracts present certain inherent risks, including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received, problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period. Alternatively, because of efficiencies that may be realized during the contract term, fixed-price contracts may offer greater profit potential than cost-plus contracts.
We are moving away from providing construction and maintenance services related to oil and gas. The construction and maintenance services we provide for oil and gas is not considered a key service and discontinuing these services will not adversely affect our operations or future revenue stream. 
In 2020, we contracted for 89% of our revenue on cost-plus contracts that provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit. The remaining 11% of our revenue was generated from fixed-price contracts.
Safety 
For over 14 years, we have maintained a safety record in the top quartile of the industry, benefiting both us and our customers. We also maintain a broad range of professional certifications and memberships in national organizations relevant to the performance of many of the specialized services we provide.
In fiscal year 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on our safety and human capital management. We continue to institute remote work policies for the corporate office in Tucker, Georgia, and allow a more flexible schedule when feasible. Our enhanced safety policies at our worksites include: modified cleaning schedules, social distancing, facial

covering requirements, employee screening practices, and contract tracing methods to meet Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. The Company, its employees, and families, have experienced the same loss felt around the globe and will continue the measures necessary to preserve the health and wellbeing of our workforce.
Market Overview
Power Generation Market and the Industrial Services Industry. The U.S. and Canadian industrial services industry is a multi-billion dollar industry, broadly defined as routine modification, maintenance and technical services provided to industrial facilities ranging from manufacturing facilities to power generation plants. The industry continues to benefit from a shift towards outsourcing as plant operators seek to alleviate financial constraints, reduce labor costs, increase labor utilization and productivity, and eliminate operational redundancies. Due to the impact of COVID-19, we have seen a decrease in new business development based on restrictions on travel and in-person meetings and stricter safety guidelines, coupled with decreased spending related to market uncertainty. 
We expect that power industry demand for these services will be driven by the following factors in the future:

● | Aging Power Generation Infrastructure Increases Demand for Plant Maintenance and Decommissioning Services. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (the “EIA”), more than half of the electrical generating capacity in the U.S. was placed in service before 1990. Coupled with the relatively limited number of large-scale power generation facilities being constructed in the U.S., the efforts to maintain older plants of all types and to take advantage of newer and more efficient technologies at existing sites result in opportunities for companies providing services to plant operators. The low price of natural gas is driving demand for new, upgraded and replacement electric generation capacity toward combined cycle gas powered plants, which are more economical to run. With natural gas pricing expected to remain low, this is also driving the conversions of simple cycle plants to combined cycle technology. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additionally, at the end of December 2019, the United States had 96 operating commercial nuclear reactors at 58 nuclear power plants in 29 states. The average age of these nuclear reactors is about 38 years old. Although in 2019 there were fewer operating nuclear reactors than in 2013, total nuclear electricity generation capacity at the end of 2019 was about the same as total capacity in 2003, when the United States had 104 operating reactors. Power plant uprates—modifications to increase capacity—at nuclear power plants have made it possible for the entire operating nuclear reactor fleet to maintain a relatively consistent total electricity generation capacity. These uprates, combined with high capacity utilization rates (or capacity factors), have helped nuclear power plants maintain a consistent share of about 20% of total annual U.S. electricity generation since 1990. Some reactors have also increased annual electricity generation by shortening the length of time reactors are offline for refueling. 
While the remainder of the operating plants are planned to operate 60 to 80 years with a stable amount of required generating capacity, utilities plan to invest in maintenance, modification, and upgrades to enable continued operations. Furthermore, as of September 2019, the NRC had extended the licenses of approximately 89 reactors. These older nuclear reactors require extensive ongoing engineering and maintenance services to support operations and improve performance. Nuclear power plants in the U.S. are subject to a rigorous program of NRC oversight, inspection, preventive and corrective maintenance, equipment replacement and equipment testing. Nuclear power plants are required to go offline to refuel at intervals of no more than 24 months and to perform condition monitoring and preventive maintenance during every refueling outage. While decommissioning work on retired nuclear reactors provides opportunities for growth, the focus is on extending the life of plants through capital improvements.

● | North America Infrastructure Growth. Increased levels of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquid production and accelerated new build and expansion of pipeline and related infrastructure to reduce transportation bottlenecks and bring more petroleum products to key markets. The value proposition of low-cost shale resources is altering the landscape for pipelines, terminals, refineries, chemical facilities, and power generation assets. Infrastructure growth and modifications provide opportunities for us to assist in the construction and maintenance of these facilities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Standby and Distributed Power Generation. Unlike central station generation, standby and distributed power generation equipment can sit on either side of the utility meter and may be owned by a utility, a customer or a third party. Peak energy demand requirements and higher costs, as well as transmission and distribution infrastructure limits, are driving investment into this space. The growth in industries with high power demand 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

and sensitivity to power supply instability, such as datacenters, medical centers, universities and remotely located industrial loads, are straining the traditional power infrastructure. The electric power needs for these markets have historically been served by small-scale utility-owned diesel or gas engine generators strategically located to support distributed system operations. The power supply is trending toward larger (greater than 1,000 kilowatts) diesel engine generator systems and expanding into alternative energy assets.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Oil and Gas Production. The fundamental transformation of the U.S. from a net importer to a net exporter of petroleum products and the increase in capacity required for domestic production, has created an opportunity to serve this industry. Natural gas production exceeded 111.2 billion cubic feet per day in 2020 compared to 92.8 billion cubic feet per day in 2019, and crude oil production continued to be high, producing 11.3 million barrels per day in 2020, although slightly down from the record high of 12.2 million barrels per day in 2019. The growing demand for specialized workers and labor offers us the opportunity to leverage our experience to support midstream terminals, refinery, and process facilities to provide maintenance services and capital improvement projects.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Water and Wastewater Treatment Infrastructure Maintenance and Capital Improvements Demand. Population growth and the percentage of the population served by public systems has accelerated our expansion in water and wastewater infrastructure maintenance and capital improvements. The growing demand for water and wastewater treatment facilities provide us the opportunity to deliver services for capital upgrades and maintenance on booster pump stations, well buildouts, treatment expansions, lift stations, and pipe installation, along with other services that we can provide to enhance our brand.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We also provide similar services to industrial wastewater treatment customers in the pulp and paper and other sectors that require wastewater treatment.
Customers, Marketing and Seasonality 
Our customers include major private and government-owned utilities throughout the U.S. and in Ontario, Canada, as well as leaders in the U.S. pulp and paper and industrial sectors. We market our services using dedicated sales and marketing personnel as well as our experienced on-site operations personnel. We use our safety and service track record with long-term renewable contracts to expand our services and supplement existing contracts with small- to medium-sized capital projects. Our sales initiatives directly seek to apply operational strengths to specific facilities within our targeted industries and customers throughout the U.S. and in Ontario, Canada. We are impacted by seasonality, resulting in fluctuations in revenue and gross profit during our fiscal year. Generally, this is driven by our customers’ schedule of planned outages which are typically scheduled for every other year (on odd numbered years).
We depend on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue, and the loss of any of those customers would have a material adverse effect on our business. For a listing of our major customers, please refer to “Note 16—Major Customers and Concentration of Credit Risk” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. 
Materials and Suppliers
The markets for most of the materials we use are served by a large number of suppliers, and we believe that we can obtain required materials from more than one supplier. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a temporary closure on an energy and industrial project in New York and, in July 2020, we implemented stricter safety precautions due to an increase in COVID-19 cases at a nuclear project in Georgia. We also experienced a slow-down in business development activities and bid opportunities, particularly in Ontario, Canada. This led to minor delays in delivery of materials and supplies but not to the extent deemed material. Although we cannot predict the ultimate impact COVID-19 will have with delivery and availability of materials and supplies, we have taken steps to adjust our operations to slowdown the spread of COVID-19 by administering stricter safety precautions and deploying efficient work at home systems, policies and procedures.
Competition 
Our competitors vary depending on geography and the scope of services to be rendered. Several national service providers, which are significantly larger and have significantly greater financial resources than we do, will often compete for larger maintenance and capital project opportunities that become available. These service providers include, among others, Allied Power, APTIM Corp., BHI Energy and Day & Zimmermann. Additionally, smaller contractors that operate on a regional 

7




basis often compete for smaller opportunities associated with open shop labor sources. We compete based on reputation, safety, price, service, quality, and our breadth of service capabilities. We believe our strong reputation, longevity in the industry, project management capabilities, including service diversity, long-term customer relationships, safety record and performance, and our success at identifying and retaining qualified personnel differentiate us from our competitors. We also believe that the fact that we maintain a presence at several of our customers’ sites is a competitive advantage because it provides us with an intimate understanding of these facilities, which allows us to better identify our customers’ service needs. Specific to our customers that operate nuclear power plants, barriers to entry include the requirement to hold and maintain the rigorous NRC qualifications and safety standards.
Insurance
We maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our operations; however, we remain exposed to potential losses because we are subject to deductibles, coverage limits and retention requirements.
Typically, our contracts require us to indemnify our customers for third party injury, damage or loss arising from the performance of our services and provide for warranties for materials and workmanship. We may also be required to name the customer as an additional insured up to the limits of insurance available, or we may be required to purchase special insurance policies for specific customers. We maintain performance and payment bonding lines to support our business. In rare cases we may provide a letter of credit in lieu of a bond to satisfy performance and financial guarantees on a project.
We require all subcontractors working with us at a customer’s location to indemnify us and our customers and name us as an additional insured for activities arising out of such subcontractors’ work. We also require certain subcontractors to provide additional insurance policies, including surety bonds in favor of us, to secure such subcontractors’ work or as required by contract. It is possible that our insurance and the additional insurance coverage provided by our subcontractors will not fully protect us against a valid claim or loss under the contracts with our customers. 
Intellectual Property
As of December 31, 2020, we used the Williams trade name and its logo. We have registered federal trademarks related to certain Company logos. As of February 19, 2021, we have registered trademarks related to certain Company logos in Canada. We presently have no U.S. patents in force. We rely on trade secret laws and employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. This Form 10-K may refer to brand names, trademarks, service marks and trade names of other companies and organizations, and those brand names, trademarks, service marks and trade names are the property of their respective owners. 
Compliance with Government Regulations
We are subject to certain federal, state, and local environmental, occupational health and nuclear regulatory laws applicable in the U.S. and Canada. We also purchase materials and equipment from third parties and engage subcontractors who are also subject to these laws and regulations. Below is a summary of certain laws and regulations applicable to our business.

● | Environmental. We are subject to extensive and changing environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and Canada. These laws and regulations relate primarily to air and water pollutants and the management and disposal of hazardous materials. We are exposed to potential liability for personal injury or property damage caused by any release, spill, exposure, or other accident involving such pollutants, substances, or hazardous materials. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Health and Safety Regulations. We are subject to the requirements of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state and international laws. Regulations promulgated by these agencies require employers and independent contractors who perform construction services, including electrical and repair and maintenance, to implement work practices, medical surveillance systems and personnel protection programs to protect employees from workplace hazards and exposure to hazardous chemicals and materials. In recognition of the potential for accidents within various scopes of work, these agencies have enacted very strict and comprehensive safety regulations. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | NRC. Owners of nuclear power plants in the U.S. are licensed to build, operate, and maintain those plants by the NRC. Their license requires that they qualify their suppliers and contractors to ensure that the suppliers and contractors comply with NRC regulations. We must demonstrate to our customers that we comply with NRC 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

regulations related to quality assurance, reporting of safety issues, security and control of personnel access and conduct.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | International Regulations. As a result of our expansion into Canada, we are subject to a variety of legal requirements pertaining to such activities. Our activities may be subject to oversight by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, and we may be subject to additional rules and regulations, including Canada’s Nuclear Liability and Compensation Act (the “NLCA”), which generally conforms to international conventions and is conceptually similar to the Price-Anderson Act in the U.S. In addition, we may be subject to rules and regulations applying to cross border business, such as international trade and tariff policies, license requirements and requirements relating to toxic substances. Violations of any applicable licensing, tariff and tax reporting requirements or failure to provide certifications relating to toxic substances could result in the imposition of significant administrative, civil, and criminal penalties. Furthermore, the failure to comply with U.S. federal, state, and local tax requirements, as well as Canadian federal and provincial tax requirements, could lead to the imposition of additional taxes, interest, and penalties. Our expansion into Canada, and into any international market, is dependent upon our ability to comply with the regulatory regimes adopted by such jurisdictions. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Department of the Treasury. The Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries and regimes, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and other threats to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States. A failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions, including the imposition of fines and suspension or debarment from participation in U.S. government contracts.

While we believe that we operate safely and prudently and in material compliance with all environmental, occupational health, nuclear regulatory and other applicable laws, there can be no assurance that accidents will not occur or that we will not incur substantial liability in connection with the operation of our business. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures or material adverse effect on earnings or cash flows as a result of complying with these laws.
Backlog
The services we provide are typically carried out under construction contracts, long-term maintenance contracts and master service agreements. Total backlog represents the dollar amount of revenue expected to be recorded in the future for work performed under awarded contracts. Prior to 2017, we reported backlog as orders from fixed-price contracts plus the amount of revenue we expected to receive in the next twelve-month period from cost-plus contracts, regardless of the remaining life of the cost-plus contract. However, we believe that reporting the total revenue expected under awarded contracts is more representative of our expected future revenue.
Revenue estimates included in our backlog can be subject to change as a result of project accelerations, cancellations or delays due to various factors, including, but not limited to, the customer’s budgetary constraints and adverse weather. These factors can also cause revenue amounts to be recognized in different periods and at levels other than those originally projected. Additional work that is not identified under the original contract is added to our estimated backlog when we reach an agreement with the customer as to the scope and pricing of that additional work. Backlog is reduced as work is performed and revenue is recognized, or upon cancellation.
Backlog is not a measure defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”), and our methodology for determining backlog may vary from the methodology used by other companies in determining their backlog amounts. Backlog may not be indicative of future operating results and projects in our backlog may be cancelled, modified, or otherwise altered by our customers.

Backlog as of December 31, 2020 decreased $51.1 million, or 10.3%, from December 31, 2019, due primarily to the completion of various long-term contracts and the acceleration of our scope related to construction at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $30.7 million, or 6.9%, of the total backlog is related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. As of December 31, 2019, approximately $155.0 million, or 31.3% of the total backlog is related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.

Employees 
We believe our employees are our greatest asset. Our business success is dependent upon our ability to attract, develop, and retain high performing talent by providing a culture that is built on our core values of safety, integrity, excellence, and results.
For over 14 years, we have maintained a safety record in the top quartile of the industry, benefiting both us and our customers. We also maintain a broad range of professional certifications and memberships in national organizations relevant to the performance of many of the specialized services we provide.
In fiscal year 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on our safety and human capital management. We continue to institute remote work policies for the corporate office in Tucker, Georgia, and allow a more flexible schedule when feasible. Our enhanced safety policies at our worksites include: modified cleaning schedules, social distancing, facial covering requirements, employee screening practices, and contract tracing methods to meet Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. The Company, its employees, and families, have experienced the same loss felt around the globe and will continue the measures necessary to preserve the health and wellbeing of our workforce.
We have implemented a robust human performance strategy that focuses on organizational factors, job-site conditions, individual behavior, and results. This strategy has contributed to a highly reliable organizational culture that has produced and consistently sustained positive results.
As of December 31, 2021, we had 460 full-time employees (excluding temporary staff and craft labor) and no part-time employees. The number of our employees, including temporary staff and craft labor, fluctuates greatly, depending on the timing and requirements for craft labor. Many of the craft labor employees are employed through various union agreements. As of December 31, 2020, there were 534 craft labor employees, of which 430 were under collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relationships with our employees, both full-time and temporary, are satisfactory. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the consequences of governmental and other measures designed to prevent the spread of virus, and the delay in development of effective treatments, along with the duration and severity of the outbreak caused slight delays in 2020 but not a complete project stoppage that would cause material negative impacts. We are not aware of any circumstances related to our employees that are likely to result in a work stoppage at any of the project sites where we are performing services.
