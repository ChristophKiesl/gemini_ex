ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
General
 
Camber Energy, Inc., a Nevada corporation, is an independent oil and natural gas company based in Houston, Texas with a field office in Gonzales, Texas. We are engaged in the acquisition, development and sale of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids from various known productive geological formations, including from the Hunton formation in Lincoln, Logan and Payne Counties, in central Oklahoma; the Cline shale and upper Wolfberry shale in Glasscock County, Texas; and recently in connection with our entry into the Horizontal San Andres play on the Central Basin Platform of the Permian Basin in West Texas announced on January 3, 2017. Incorporated in Nevada in December 2003 under the name Panorama Investments Corp., the Company changed its name to Lucas Energy, Inc. effective June 9, 2006 and effective January 4, 2017, the Company changed its name to Camber Energy, Inc.
 
Our primary value drivers are our reserves which must be developed to unlock their full potential. We believe the market conditions driving us toward the need for a larger entity of greater size and financial mass are even more essential in the current environment. In order to develop the significant reserves at our disposal, we believe that we must become, or become part of, a larger organization with ample cash flow and greater access to capital. Measures such as return on equity, liquidity and stock multiples have led us to conclude that the market, in general, views small-cap and mid-cap exploration and production companies as having greater potential than microcaps. The larger companies tend to have access to more favorable debt financing, receive greater analyst coverage, trade with greater liquidity and consequently, often have higher share prices.
 
On December 30, 2015, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) as amended from time to time to acquire from twenty-three different entities and individuals (the “Sellers”), working interests in producing properties and undeveloped acreage (the “Acquisition”), which acquisition transaction was completed on August 25, 2016 and effective on April 1, 2016. The assets acquired include varied interests in two largely contiguous acreage blocks in the liquids-rich Mid-Continent region. In connection with the closing of the acquisition, we assumed approximately $30.6 million of commercial bank debt, issued 13,009,664 shares of common stock to certain of the Sellers, issued 552,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to one of the Sellers and its affiliate, and paid $4,975,000 in cash to certain of the Sellers.
 
Pursuant to a Letter Agreement we entered into, at the closing of the Acquisition, with RAD2 Minerals, Ltd. (“RAD2”), one of the Sellers, which is owned and controlled by Richard N. Azar II, who was appointed as our Chairman on August 26, 2016, serving as Chairman until May 16, 2017, provided that Mr. Azar continues to serve as a member of the Board of Directors and who was appointed as interim Chief Executive Officer of the Company on June 2, 2017, RAD2 agreed to accept full financial liability for any and all deficiencies between the “Agreed Assets Value” set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement of $80,697,710, and the mutually agreed upon value of the assets delivered by the Sellers at the closing of the Acquisition, up to an aggregate of $1,030,941 (as applicable, the “Deficiency”). The Company accepted additional oil and gas producing properties and two salt water disposal facilities from the Sellers with an approximate value of $1.0 million to resolve this Deficiency.
 
On April 6, 2016, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with an accredited institutional investor (the “Investor”), pursuant to which we sold and issued a redeemable convertible subordinated debenture, with a face amount of $530,000 (the “Debenture”), initially convertible into 163,077 shares of common stock (subject to certain conversion premiums) at a conversion price equal to $3.25 per share and a warrant to initially purchase 1,384,616 shares of common stock (subject to adjustment thereunder) at an exercise price equal to $3.25 per share (the “First Warrant”). The Investor purchased the debenture at a 5.0% original issue discount for the sum of $500,000 and has exercised the First Warrant in full as described below for the sum of $4.5 million.
 
Also on April 6, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with the Investor, pursuant to which we agreed, subject to certain conditions, to issue up to 527 shares of Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock (the “Series C Preferred Stock”) at a 5% original issue discount, convertible into 1,618,462 shares of common stock (subject to certain conversion premiums) at a conversion price of $3.25 per share, and a warrant to initially purchase 1,111,112 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $4.50 per share (the “Second Warrant”). Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Second Warrant and 53 shares of Series C Preferred Stock were sold and issued for $500,000 on September 2, 2016, and the remaining 474 shares of Series C Preferred Stock were sold and issued for $4.5 million on November 17, 2016.

On October 7, 2016, the Investor exercised the First Warrant in full and was due 1,384,616 shares of common stock upon exercise thereof and an additional 2,542,735 shares of common stock in consideration for the conversion premium due thereon. A total of 810,000 shares were issued to the Investor on October 7, 2016, with the remaining shares being held in abeyance until such time as it would not result in the Investor exceeding its beneficial ownership limitation (4.99% of the Company’s outstanding common stock). The Company received gross proceeds of $4,500,000 from the exercise of the First Warrant and paid placement agent fees of $427,500 for services rendered in connection with the First Warrant. Pursuant to the terms of the First Warrant, the number of shares due in consideration for the conversion premium increases as the annual rate of return under the First Warrant increases, including by 10% upon the occurrence of certain triggering events (which had occurred by the October 7, 2016 date of exercise), to 17% per annum upon the exercise of the First Warrant. Additionally, as the conversion rate for the conversion premium is currently 85% of the lowest daily volume weighted average price during the measuring period, less $0.10 per share of common stock not to exceed 85% of the lowest sales prices on the last day of such period less $0.10 per share, the number of shares issuable in connection with the conversion premium increases as the trading price of our common stock decreases, and the trading price of our common stock has decreased since the date the First Warrant was exercised, triggering a further reduction in the conversion price of the conversion premium and an increase in the number of shares due to the Investor in connection with the conversion of the amount owed in connection with the conversion premium. Additionally, pursuant to the interpretation of the Investor, the measurement period for the calculation of the lowest daily volume weighted average price currently continues indefinitely.
 
As of July 10, 2017, a total of 9,675,154 shares of common stock had been issued to the Investor in connection with the exercise of the First Warrant of the approximately 37,496,859 shares which were alleged due (25,052,473 shares remain to be issued to the Investor, which shares are currently held in abeyance until such time as it would not result in the Investor exceeding its beneficial ownership limitation (4.99% of the Company’s outstanding common stock)) as of July 10, 2017 (subject to increases as the value of our common stock decreases).
 
On January 5, 2017, the Investor converted 21 shares of the Series C Preferred stock (equal to a face value of $210,000), and was due 64,146 shares of common stock and an additional 657,196 shares of common stock in dividend premium shares; on January 23, 2017, the Investor converted 21 shares of the Series C Preferred stock (equal to a face value of $210,000), and was due 64,146 shares of common stock and an additional 780,694 shares of common stock in dividend premium shares; on February 22, 2017, the Investor converted 21 shares of the Series C Preferred stock (equal to a face value of $210,000), and was due 64,146 shares of common stock and an additional 1,138,159 shares of common stock in dividend premium shares; on March 2, 2017, the Investor converted 15 shares of the Series C Preferred stock (equal to a face value of $150,000), and was due 46,154 shares of common stock and an additional 812,971 shares of common stock in dividend premium shares; on March 28, 2017, the Investor converted 13 shares of the Series C Preferred stock (equal to a face value of $130,000), and was due 40,000 shares of common stock and an additional 1,247,235 shares of common stock in dividend premium shares; and on April 11, 2017, the Investor converted 10 shares of the Series C Preferred stock (equal to a face value of $100,000), and was due 30,770 shares of common stock and an additional 1,243,772 shares of common stock in dividend premium shares.
 
As of July 10, 2017, the Investor was still due 63,723,398 shares of common stock upon the conversion of the remaining 394 shares of Series C Preferred stock. The Investor is also due approximately 8,571,930 shares of common stock upon the conversion of the Debenture.
 
Our management is focused on achieving greater stockholder value through a turbulent period. Specifically, our immediate efforts include: (i) restructuring our general and administrative costs, (ii) attempting to re-finance our current debt with some combination of new debt and equity, and (iii) considering the potential acquisition of oil and gas properties for equity; all in an effort to stabilize our company and provide an increased base of operating cash flow. Our future expectations, which assume we raise additional funding in the future through the sale of equity or debt, and we have sufficient cash flow to meet our debt obligations, continue to include an increase in production through development of our acreage, increased profitability margins by evaluating and optimizing our production, and executing our business plan with the goal of increasing property values, reserves, and expanding our asset base.

At March 31, 2017, we had leasehold interests (working interests) in approximately 82,046 gross acres, or 26,990 net acres. Our total net developed and undeveloped acreage as measured from the surface to the base of the Austin Chalk formation was approximately 7,333 net acres. Our total net developed and undeveloped acreage in the Central Oklahoma region is 16,122 net acres, and our total net developed and undeveloped acreage in West Texas is 3,535 net acres.
 
For the year ending March 31, 2017, we produced an average of approximately 616 net barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boepd) from 120 active well bores, of which 78 wells were operated by the Company. The ratio between the gross and net production varies due to varied working interests and net revenue interests in each well. We operate over 65% of our producing wells. Our production sales totaled 224,954 barrels of oil equivalent (Boe), net to our interest, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.
 
At March 31, 2017, our total estimated net proved reserves were 5.6 million Boe, of which 1.6 million barrels (Bbls) were crude oil reserves, and 4.2 billion cubic feet (Bcf) were natural gas reserves. Of these quantities, approximately 80% and 24%, respectively, are classified as proved undeveloped.
 
As of March 31, 2017, we employed ten full-time employees. We also utilized ten contractors on an “as-needed” basis to carry out various functions, including but not limited to field operations, land administration, corporate activity and information technology maintenance. No employee is covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
 
We have an experienced management team with proven acquisition, operating and financing capabilities. Mr. Richard Azar, our Interim Chief Executive Officer, has over thirty years of extensive oil and gas and financial management experience. Since 1982, Mr. Azar’s companies have explored for, produced and operated over 1,000 wells in Central, South and West Texas and Central Oklahoma, including the development of the Hunton Dewatering Resource play in central Oklahoma.
 
In order to expand our operations in accordance with our business plan, we intend to hire additional employees and consultants with expertise in the areas of corporate development, petroleum engineering, geological and geophysical sciences and accounting, as well as hiring additional technical, operations and administrative staff. We are not currently able to estimate the number of employees that we will hire during the next twelve months since that number will depend upon the rate at which our operations expand and upon the extent to which we engage third parties to perform required services, and the availability of adequate funding.
 
Recent Events
 
In February 2017, we, together with our financing partner, Jaffe Energy, Inc. (“JEI”) via our subsidiary, Camber Permian II LLC (“CPII”), entered into a definitive Purchase and Sale Agreement (“PSA”) with private sellers to acquire oil and gas leases covering approximately 13,000 net acres in the Permian Basin for a drilling project known as the “Arrowhead Project.” Effective May 1, 2017, JEI rescinded its funding and formally withdrew from CPII. Contemporaneously, CPII assigned its rights and interests in the PSA and Arrowhead to an undisclosed, private oil and gas company (the “OG Co”). As consideration for assigning the PSA, CPII reserved (i) the right to a 30% interest acquired under the PSA in an existing well on Arrowhead, subject to work necessary to bring it on production, and (ii) an optional right to purchase 30% of the remaining properties comprising the Arrowhead project for $2.7 million at a future date after two wells are drilled thereon by OG Co, plus CPII’s proportionate share of the costs of all lease extensions and renewals that are acquired by OG Co. CPIIs right to exercise this option is subject to its ability to obtain funding necessary to close the transaction and to fund its share of participation in future Arrowhead drilling activities.
Industry Segments
 
Camber Energy’s operations are all crude oil and natural gas exploration and production related.

Operations and Oil and Gas Properties
 
We operate and invest in areas that are known to be productive, with a reasonably established production history, in order to decrease geological and exploratory risk. Our activities in the Gulf Coast areas of Texas are concentrated on two adjoining formations: the Austin Chalk and Eagle Ford, provided that we are not currently active in those areas as of the filing of this report and do not plan to be in the future. Camber’s acreage position is in the oil window of the Eagle Ford trend and we currently have approximately 7,300 net acres in the Gonzales, Karnes and Wilson County, Texas areas, all of which are held by production. With the closing of the Acquisition, the Company acquired over 13,000 net acres in producing fields located primarily in the Mid-Continent region of Oklahoma including Payne, Lincoln and Logan Counties, along with a small amount of interest in production located in Glasscock County, Texas. The Mid-Continent assets produce from a liquids-rich, gas reservoir known as the Hunton formation. These properties include interests in four different fields, of which one is operated by Camber and the other three are non-operated. The Glasscock County, Texas properties produce oil and gas primarily from the Wolfberry, Cline and Fusselman formations and are all non-operated. In addition, the Company recently acquired approximately 3,600 net acres and operations under a joint venture agreement to pursue the emerging Horizontal San Andres play in Gaines County, Texas, located in the Central Basin Platform area of the Permian Basin (as described in greater detail below). The Company intends to resume and continue its leasing activities at Jack Rabbit during the second-half of 2017, funding permitting, to position the Company for a drilling program beginning in 2018, funding permitting with a joint venture partner for drilling and/or a farmout. In addition, the Company negotiated an Option Agreement for acquiring a 28.5% non-operated working interest in 11,000 net acres, also in pursuit of the Horizontal San Andres Play in Yoakum and Cochran Counties, Texas, located in the Northwest Shelf area of the Permian Basin, known as the Arrowhead Project. 
Marketing
 
We operate exclusively in the onshore United States oil and natural gas industry. Our crude oil and natural gas production sales are to gatherers and marketers with national reputations. Our sales are made on a month-to-month basis, and title transfer occurs when the oil is loaded onto the purchaser’s truck. Crude oil prices realized from production sales are indexed to published posted refinery prices, and to published crude indexes with adjustments on a contract basis.
 
We generally sell a significant portion of our oil and gas production to a relatively small number of customers. For the year ended March 31, 2017, our consolidated revenues were from the sale of oil, gas and natural gas liquids under marketing contracts with Shell Trading (US) Company, Superior Pipeline Company, Scissortail Energy, LLC, and DCP Midstream, LP. We are not dependent upon any one purchaser and have alternative purchasers available at competitive market prices if there is disruption in services or other events that cause us to search for other ways to sell our production.
 
During the year ended March 31, 2017, three customers accounted for approximately 42%, 24% and 12% of our total sales. During the year ended March 31, 2016, two customers accounted for approximately 19% and 10% of our total sales. We do not believe that the loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on us because alternative customers are readily available.
 
We actively manage our crude oil inventory in field tanks and have engaged a marketing company to negotiate our crude and natural gas contracts.
 
Competition
 
We are in direct competition for properties with numerous oil and natural gas companies and partnerships exploring various areas of Texas, Oklahoma and elsewhere. Many competitors are large, well-known oil and natural gas and/or energy companies, although no single entity dominates the industry. Many of our competitors possess greater financial and personnel resources, enabling them to identify and acquire more economically desirable energy producing properties and drilling prospects than us. Additionally, there is competition from other fuel choices to supply the energy needs of consumers and industry.

Regulation
 
Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. These regulations include requiring permits for the drilling of wells; maintaining hazard prevention, health and safety plans; submitting notification and receiving permits related to the presence, use and release of certain materials incidental to oil and natural gas operations; and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the use, transportation, storage and disposal of fluids and materials used in connection with drilling and production activities, surface plugging and abandonment of wells and the transporting of production. Our operations are also subject to various conservation matters, including the number of wells which may be drilled in a unit and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties. In this regard, some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration, while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases, which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally limiting the venting or flaring of natural gas, and impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production. The effect of these regulations is to possibly limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill.
 
In the United States, legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry has been pervasive and is under constant review for amendment or expansion. Pursuant to such legislation, numerous federal, state and local departments and agencies issue recommended new and extensive rules and regulations binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. These laws and regulations have a significant impact on oil and natural gas drilling, natural gas processing plants and production activities, increasing the cost of doing business and, consequently, affect profitability. Insomuch as new legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is common-place and existing laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, we may be unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with these laws and regulations. We consider the cost of environmental protection a necessary and manageable part of our business. We have historically been able to plan for and comply with new environmental initiatives without materially altering our operating strategies.
 
Insurance Matters
 
We maintain insurance coverage which we believe is reasonable per the standards of the oil and natural gas industry. It is common for companies in this industry to not insure fully against all risks associated with their operations either because such insurance is unavailable or because premium costs are considered prohibitive. A material loss not fully covered by insurance could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We maintain insurance at industry customary levels to limit our financial exposure in the event of a substantial environmental claim resulting from sudden, unanticipated and accidental discharges of certain prohibited substances into the environment. Such insurance might not cover the complete amount of such a claim and would not cover fines or penalties for a violation of an environmental law.
Other Matters
 
Environmental. Our exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas, including our operation of saltwater injection and disposal wells, are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations can increase the costs of planning, designing, installing and operating oil, natural gas, and disposal wells. Our domestic activities are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations, including but not limited to, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”), the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), the Clean Air Act (CAA), and the Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”), as well as state regulations promulgated under comparable state statutes. We are also subject to regulations governing the handling, transportation, storage, and disposal of naturally occurring radioactive materials that are found in our oil and gas operations. Civil and criminal fines and penalties may be imposed for non-compliance with these environmental laws and regulations. Additionally, these laws and regulations require the acquisition of permits or other governmental authorizations before undertaking certain activities, limit or prohibit other activities because of protected areas or species, and impose substantial liabilities for cleanup of pollution.

Under the OPA, a release of oil into water or other areas designated by the statute could result in us being held responsible for the costs of remediating such a release, certain OPA specified damages, and natural resource damages. The extent of that liability could be extensive, as set forth in the statute, depending on the nature of the release. A release of oil in harmful quantities or other materials into water or other specified areas could also result in us being held responsible under the CWA for the costs of remediation, and civil and criminal fines and penalties.
 
CERCLA and comparable state statutes, also known as “Superfund” laws, can impose joint and several and retroactive liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. In practice, cleanup costs are usually allocated among various responsible parties. Potentially liable parties include site owners or operators, past owners or operators under certain conditions, and entities that arrange for the disposal or treatment of, or transport hazardous substances found at the site. Although CERCLA, as amended, currently exempts petroleum, including but not limited to, crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, from the definition of hazardous substance, our operations may involve the use or handling of other materials that may be classified as hazardous substances under CERCLA. Furthermore, the exemption may not be preserved in future amendments of the act, if any.
 
RCRA and comparable state and local requirements impose standards for the management, including treatment, storage, and disposal, of both hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes. We generate hazardous and non-hazardous solid waste in connection with our routine operations. From time to time, proposals have been made that would reclassify certain oil and natural gas wastes, including wastes generated during drilling, production and pipeline operations, as “hazardous wastes” under RCRA, which would make such solid wastes subject to much more stringent handling, transportation, storage, disposal, and clean-up requirements. This development could have a significant impact on our operating costs. While state laws vary on this issue, state initiatives to further regulate oil and natural gas wastes could have a similar impact. Because oil and natural gas exploration and production, and possibly other activities, have been conducted at some of our properties by previous owners and operators, materials from these operations remain on some of the properties and in some instances, require remediation. In addition, in certain instances, we have agreed to indemnify sellers of producing properties from which we have acquired reserves against certain liabilities for environmental claims associated with such properties. While we do not believe that costs to be incurred by us for compliance and remediating previously or currently owned or operated properties will be material, there can be no guarantee that such costs will not result in material expenditures.
 
Additionally, in the course of our routine oil and natural gas operations, surface spills and leaks, including casing leaks, of oil or other materials occur, and we incur costs for waste handling and environmental compliance. Moreover, we are able to control directly the operations of only those wells for which we act as the operator. Management believes that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations.
 
In response to liabilities associated with these activities, accruals are established when reasonable estimates are possible. Such accruals would primarily include estimated costs associated with remediation. We have used discounting to present value in determining our accrued liabilities for environmental remediation or well closure, but no material claims for possible recovery from third party insurers or other parties related to environmental costs have been recognized in our financial statements. We adjust the accruals when new remediation responsibilities are discovered and probable costs become estimable, or when current remediation estimates must be adjusted to reflect new information.
 
We do not anticipate being required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to our total capital expenditures program by reason of environmental laws and regulations, but inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance. More stringent laws and regulations protecting the environment may be adopted in the future and we may incur material expenses in connection with environmental laws and regulations in the future.
 
Occupational Health and Safety. We are also subject to laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health. Due to the continued changes in these laws and regulations, and the judicial construction of many of them, we are unable to predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our future costs of complying with these laws and regulations. We consider the cost of safety and health compliance a necessary and manageable part of our business. We have been able to plan for and comply with new initiatives without materially altering our operating strategies.

Hydraulic Fracturing. Vast quantities of natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil deposits exist in deep shale and other unconventional formations. It is customary in our industry to recover these resources through the use of hydraulic fracturing, combined with horizontal drilling. Hydraulic fracturing is the process of creating or expanding cracks, or fractures, in deep underground formations using water, sand and other additives pumped under high pressure into the formation. As with the rest of the industry, we use hydraulic fracturing as a means to increase the productivity of almost every well that we drill and complete. These formations are generally geologically separated and isolated from fresh ground water supplies by thousands of feet of impermeable rock layers. We follow applicable legal requirements for groundwater protection in our operations that are subject to supervision by state and federal regulators (including the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) on federal acreage). Furthermore, our well construction practices require the installation of multiple layers of protective steel casing surrounded by cement that are specifically designed and installed to protect freshwater aquifers by preventing the migration of fracturing fluids into aquifers.
 
Injection rates and pressures are required to be monitored in real time at the surface during our hydraulic fracturing operations. Pressure is required to be monitored on both the injection string and the immediate annulus to the injection string. Hydraulic fracturing operations are required to be shut down if an abrupt change occurs to the injection pressure or annular pressure. These aspects of hydraulic fracturing operations are designed to prevent a pathway for the fracturing fluid to contact any aquifers during the hydraulic fracturing operations.
 
Hydraulic fracture stimulation requires the use of water. We use fresh water or recycled produced water in our fracturing treatments in accordance with applicable water management plans and laws. Several proposals are before the U.S. Congress that, if implemented, would either prohibit or restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Several states are considering legislation to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices that could impose more stringent permitting, transparency, and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. Hydraulic fracturing of wells and subsurface water disposal are also under public and governmental scrutiny due to potential environmental and physical impacts, including possible contamination of groundwater and drinking water and possible links to earthquakes. In addition, some municipalities have significantly limited or prohibited drilling activities and/or hydraulic fracturing, or are considering doing so.
 
Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could make it prohibitive to conduct our operations, and also reduce the amount of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce in commercial quantities from our properties.
 
The Endangered Species Act. The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) restricts activities that may affect areas that contain endangered or threatened species or their habitats. While some of our assets and lease acreage may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the ESA. However, the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species in areas where we intend to conduct construction activity could materially limit or delay our plans.
Global Warming and Climate Change. Various state governments and regional organizations are considering enacting new legislation and promulgating new regulations governing or restricting the emission of greenhouse gases from stationary sources such as our equipment and operations. Legislative and regulatory proposals for restricting greenhouse gas emissions or otherwise addressing climate change could require us to incur additional operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the natural gas and oil that we sell. The potential increase in our operating costs could include new or increased costs to obtain permits, operate and maintain our equipment and facilities, install new emission controls on our equipment and facilities, acquire allowances to authorize our greenhouse gas emissions, pay taxes related to our greenhouse gas emissions and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program.
Taxation. Our operations, as is the case in the petroleum industry generally, are significantly affected by federal tax laws. Federal, as well as state, tax laws have many provisions applicable to corporations which could affect our future tax liabilities.
Commitments and Contingencies. We are liable for future restoration and abandonment costs associated with our oil and gas properties. These costs include future site restoration, post closure and other environmental exit costs. The costs of future restoration and well abandonment have not been determined in detail. State regulations require operators to post bonds that assure that well sites will be properly plugged and abandoned. We currently operate only in Texas and Oklahoma, which require a security bond based on the number of wells we operate. Management views this as a necessary requirement for operations and does not believe that these costs will have a material adverse effect on our financial position as a result of this requirement.
