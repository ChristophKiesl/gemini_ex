ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Introduction



We are a blank check company incorporated on July 21, 2021 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this report as our initial business combination. While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any business or industry, we intend to search globally, with a focus on target companies within the healthcare industry.



The Registration Statement for our initial public offering was declared effective on November 17, 2021 (the “Initial Public Offering,” or “IPO”). On November 22, 2021, we consummated its Initial Public Offering of 6,000,000 units (the “Units”) at $10.00 per Unit Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, $0.0001 par value (the “Common Stock”), one right to receive one-twentieth (1/20) of a share of Common Stock upon the consummation of an initial business combination and one redeemable warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase three-fourths (3/4) of a share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per whole share. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $60,000,000. The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 900,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any. The Company incurred offering costs of $5,587,733, of which $2,587,500 was for deferred underwriting commissions. On November 22, 2021, the over-allotment option was exercised in full.



On November 22, 2021, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of 193,889 units and 60,000 units, respectively (the “Private Units”) to Arisz Investments LLC, the Company’s sponsor (the “Sponsor”) and Chardan Capital Markets, LLC, generating total proceeds of $2,538,886.



Also, on November 22, 2021, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in full. The closing of the issuance and sale of the additional Units (the “Over-Allotment Option Units”) occurred on November 24, 2021. The total aggregate issuance by the Company of 900,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit resulted in total gross proceeds of $9,000,000. On November 24, 2021, simultaneously with the sale of the Over-Allotment Option Units, the Company consummated the private sale of an additional 13,500 Private Units and 9,000 Private Units to the sponsor and Chardan Capital Markets, LLC, respectively, generating gross proceeds of $225,000. The Private Units were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering.



A total of $69,000,000 of the net proceeds from the sale of Units in the IPO (including the Over-Allotment Option Units) and the Private Placements on November 22, 2021 and November 24, 2021, were placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”), located in the United States and held as cash items or may be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by us, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to our stockholders.



If we are unable to complete an initial business combination within 15 months (or up to 18 months if our time to complete a business combination is extended as described herein) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining holders of common stock and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Holders of rights or warrants will receive no proceeds in connection with the liquidation with respect to such rights or warrants, which will expire worthless. In connection with our redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares, each holder will receive an amount equal to (1) the number of public shares being converted by such public holder divided by the total number of public shares multiplied by (2) the amount then in the trust account (initially $10.00 per share), which includes the deferred underwriting commission, plus a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us or necessary to pay our taxes (subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors).

Following the Business Combination, Purchaser will be a publicly traded company listed on a stock exchange in the United States. On April 4, 2022, each of Arisz and BitFuFu entered into that certain Amendment to the Merger Agreement pursuant to which, among other things, the parties clarified certain Cayman Island corporate law matters by mutual agreement. Also on April 4, 2022, each of Purchaser, Merger Sub, Arisz and BitFuFu executed that certain Joinder Agreement to the Merger Agreement, whereby each of Purchaser and Merger Sub have agreed, effective upon execution, that it shall become a party to the Merger Agreement and shall be fully bound by, and subject to, all of the covenants, terms, representations, warranties, rights, obligations and conditions of the Merger Agreement as though an original party thereto.



On October 10, 2022, each of Arisz and BitFuFu entered into that certain Amendment (“Amendment No. 2”) to the Merger Agreement to provide, among other things:

(3) for a loan from BitFuFu to Arisz in the amount of Two Million Two Hundred and Twenty Thousand Dollars ($2,220,000) for the purpose of funding any payment due in connection with an extension of the period of time for Arisz to consummate a business combination and for working capital purposes (the “Loan”). The Loan shall be funded in three equal installments on each of October 26, 2022, January 26, 2023 and April 26, 2023, in each case in the amount of Seven Hundred Forty Thousand Dollars ($740,000). Of each such installment, the sum of Six Hundred Ninety Thousand Dollars ($690,000) (the “Extension Funding Amount”) shall be used to cover the extension costs, and the remaining Fifty Thousand ($50,000) shall be used for working capital. In the event that the actual extension costs are less than the Extension Funding Amount, Arisz shall promptly repay the difference between such actual extension costs and the Extension Funding Amount. Arisz shall issue a promissory note for the amount of the Loan in favor of the Company;



(4) that the Outside Date is extended to August 1, 2023;

Competition



In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the initial business combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. 
Employees



We currently have two officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary, in the exercise of their respective business judgement, to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. We do not have an employment agreement with any member of our management team.



For additional discussion of the general development of our business, see our final prospectus on Form 424B4 filed with the SEC on November 17, 2021.
