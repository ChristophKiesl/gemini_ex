2020 | 11,801 | | 101.5 | %
2019 | 12,552 | | 103.0 | %


Cleco Power’s generation dispatch and transmission operations are integrated with MISO. The amount of power generated by Cleco Power is dictated by the availability of Cleco Power’s generating fleet and the manner in which MISO dispatches each generating unit. Depending on how generating units are dispatched by MISO, the amount of power 

generated may be greater than or less than total energy requirements. Generating units are dispatched by referencing each unit’s economic efficiency as it relates to the overall MISO market. For more information on MISO, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Financial Condition — Regulatory and Other Matters — Transmission Rates.”
Fuel and Purchased Power 
Changes in fuel expenses reflect fluctuations in the amount, type, and pricing of fuel used for electric generation; fuel transportation and delivery costs; and deferral of expenses for recovery from customers through Cleco Power’s FAC in subsequent months. Changes in purchased power expenses are a result of the quantity and price of economic power 



CLECO | 
CLECO POWER | 2021 FORM 10-K

purchased from the MISO market. These quantity changes can be affected by Cleco plant outages and plant performance. For a discussion of certain risks associated with changes in fuel costs and their impact on utility customers, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors — Operational Risks — Transmission Constraints” and “— Regulatory Risks — LPSC Audits.”

The following table sets forth the percentages of power generated from various fuels at Cleco Power’s electric generating plants, the cost of fuel used per MWh attributable to each such fuel, and the weighted average fuel cost per MWh:

Power Purchases
Cleco Power is a participant in the MISO market. MISO makes economic and routine dispatch decisions regarding Cleco Power’s generating units. Power purchases are made at prevailing market prices, also referred to as LMP, which are highly correlated to natural gas prices. LMP includes a component directly related to congestion on the transmission system. Pricing zones with greater transmission congestion may have higher LMPs. Physical transmission constraints present in the MISO market could increase energy costs within Cleco Power’s pricing zones. For information on Cleco Power’s ability to pass on to its customers substantially all of its fuel and purchased power expenses, see “— Regulatory Matters, Industry Developments, and Franchises — Rates.” For information on MISO, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Financial Condition — Regulatory and Other Matters — Transmission Rates.”
Coal, Petroleum Coke, and Lignite Supply
Cleco Power uses coal for generation at Rodemacher Unit 2. During 2021, Cleco Power contracted with multiple suppliers to provide Cleco Power’s coal needs at Rodemacher Unit 2, utilizing short-term coal agreements. The coal supply agreements were fixed-price contracts. For 2022, Cleco Power intends to meet its coal needs through short-term, fixed-price coal agreements. For the transportation of coal, Cleco Power renewed its agreement on January 1, 2020 to transport coal from Wyoming’s Powder River Basin to Rodemacher Unit 2. The agreement is for three years, expiring on December 31, 2022. During 2021, Cleco Power renewed its lease for 113 railcars to transport its coal under one lease, which expires on March 31, 2024.
The continuous supply of coal may be subject to interruption due to adverse weather conditions or other factors that may disrupt transportation to the plant site. At December 31, 2021, Cleco Power’s coal inventory at Rodemacher Unit 2 was approximately 127,000 tons (approximately a 53-day supply).
Cleco Power uses a combination of petroleum coke and Illinois Basin coal for generation at Madison Unit 3. Petroleum coke is a by-product of the oil refinery process and is not considered a fuel specifically produced for a market; however, ample petroleum coke supplies are produced from refineries each year throughout the world, particularly in the Gulf Coast region. During 2021, Cleco received its petroleum coke supply from multiple refineries located along the upper and lower Mississippi River. Cleco purchased approximately 948,000 tons of petroleum coke during 2021, all of which were either an 

evergreen extension of a previous agreement or a negotiated agreement for one year ending on December 31, 2021. For 2022, Cleco has contracted for 880,000 tons of petroleum coke from multiple refineries located along the upper and lower Mississippi River through one-year agreements ending on December 31, 2022.
During 2021, Cleco purchased approximately 294,000 tons of Illinois Basin coal. Cleco Power uses Louisiana waterways, such as the Mississippi River and the Red River, to deliver both petroleum coke and Illinois Basin coal to the Madison Unit 3 plant site. The continuous supply of petroleum coke and Illinois Basin coal may be subject to interruption due to adverse weather conditions or other factors that may disrupt transportation to the plant site. Cleco Power has a logistics agreement with its primary transportation coordinator and provider that is set to expire in March 2033. At December 31, 2021, Cleco Power’s petroleum coke inventory at Madison Unit 3 was approximately 191,000 tons, and Cleco Power’s Illinois Basin coal inventory at Madison Unit 3 was approximately 161,000 tons. The total fuel inventory was 352,000 tons (approximately a 64-day supply).
Prior to the retirement of the generating unit, Cleco Power used lignite for generation at the Dolet Hills Power Station. In April 2020, Cleco Power and SWEPCO, joint owners of Dolet Hills, mutually agreed not to develop additional mining areas for future lignite extraction and subsequently provided notice to the LPSC of the intent to cease mining at the Dolet Hills and Oxbow mines by June 2020. On October 6, 2020, Cleco Power and SWEPCO made a joint filing with the LPSC seeking authorization to close the mines. As of June 30, 2020, all lignite reserves intended to be extracted from the mines had been extracted. On March 17, 2021, the LPSC approved the establishment of a regulatory asset for the deferral of certain mine costs in fuel and related ratemaking treatment. The Dolet Hills Power Station was retired on December 31, 2021. On January 31, 2022, Cleco Power filed an application with the LPSC requesting recovery of an estimated $326.0 million of stranded and decommissioning costs associated with the retirement of the Dolet Hills Power Station and the closure of the mines.
For more information regarding the closure of the mines and the retirement of the Dolet Hills Power Station, see Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Notes to the Financial Statements — Note 6 — Regulatory Assets and Liabilities — Dolet Hills Power Station Closure Costs” and — “Lignite Mine Closure Costs”. Also see Note 15 — “Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, and Disclosures about Guarantees — Off-Balance Sheet Commitments and Guarantees,” — “Risks and Uncertainties.”

For more information on Oxbow, see Note 14 — “Variable Interest Entities.”
Natural Gas Supply
During 2021, Cleco Power purchased 47.4 million MMBtu of natural gas for the generation of electricity. The annual and average per-day quantities of gas purchased by Cleco Power from each supplier are shown in the following table:

NATURAL GAS SUPPLIER | 2021PURCHASES(MMBtu) | AVERAGE AMOUNTPURCHASEDPER DAY (MMBtu) | | PERCENT OFTOTAL NATURALGAS USED
Tenaska Marketing Ventures | 12,309,528 | | 33,725 | | 26.0 | %
Mansfield Power and Gas | 10,254,249 | | 28,094 | | 21.6 | %
Cima Energy LP | 9,968,246 | | 27,310 | | 21.0 | %
Others | 14,884,879 | | 40,780 | | 31.4 | %
Total | 47,416,902 | | 129,909 | | 100.0 | %

Cleco Power owns natural gas pipelines and interconnections at all of its generating facilities that allow it to access various natural gas supply markets and maintain a reliable, economical fuel supply for Cleco Power’s customers.
Although there were spikes in natural gas prices during 2021, natural gas was available without interruption throughout the year. Cleco Power expects to continue to meet its natural gas requirements with purchases on the spot market through daily, monthly, and seasonal contracts with various natural gas suppliers. However, future supplies to Cleco Power remain vulnerable to disruptions due to weather events and transportation issues. Large industrial users of natural gas, including electric utilities, generally have low priority among gas users in the event pipeline suppliers are forced to curtail deliveries due to inadequate supplies. As a result, prices may increase rapidly in response to temporary supply interruptions. During 2021, in order to partially address potential natural gas fuel curtailments and interruptions, Cleco contracted for natural gas firm transportation with two interstate pipelines for a period of one year ending in October 31, 2022.
Cleco also uses underground salt dome gas storage to help mitigate supply disruptions to Cleco Power’s generating facilities and to operationally balance gas supply to its units. The storage volume is contracted by paying a capacity reservation charge at a fixed rate. There are also variable charges incurred to withdraw and inject gas from storage. At December 31, 2021, Cleco Power had 1.3 million MMBtu of gas in storage. Currently, Cleco Power anticipates that its diverse supply options and gas storage, combined with its solid-fuel generation resources, are adequate to meet its generation needs during any temporary interruption of natural gas supplies.
Sales
Cleco Power’s 2021 and 2020 system peak demands, which occurred on February 16, 2021, and July 13, 2020, were 2,645 MW and 2,536 MW, respectively. Sales and system peak demand are affected by weather and are typically highest during the summer air-conditioning season; however, peaks may occur during the winter season as well. For information on the effects of future energy sales on Cleco Power’s results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors — Operational Risks — Future Electricity Sales” and “— Weather Sensitivity.”
Reserve margin is the net capacity resources (either owned or purchased) less native load demand, divided by 

native load demand. Members of MISO submit their forecasted native load demand to MISO each year. During 2021, Cleco Power’s reserve margin was 22.5%, which was above MISO’s unforced planning reserve margin benchmark of 9.4%. During 2020, Cleco Power’s reserve margin was 30.5%, which was also above MISO’s unforced planning reserve margin benchmark of 8.9%. Cleco Power expects to meet or exceed MISO’s unforced planning reserve margin benchmark of 8.7% in 2022. For more information on MISO, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Financial Condition — Regulatory and Other Matters — Transmission Rates.” 
In 2020 and 2021, Cleco Power's service territory was severely impacted by four separate hurricanes and two winter storms, resulting in significant outages for its customers. For information on these hurricanes and winter storms, see Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Notes to the Financial Statements — Note 19 — Storm Restoration, Securitization, and Cost Recovery.”
Competition
In 2021, a wholesale customer that is currently Cleco Power’s largest single customer, based on revenue, and is under contract with Cleco Power through March 31, 2024, conducted a request for proposal for capacity and energy beginning April 1, 2024, in which Cleco Power participated. In August 2021, the wholesale customer informed Cleco Power that it was not selected as a provider of capacity and energy after the first quarter of 2024 and filed a notice with the LPSC to certify the results of the request for proposal. Cleco Power subsequently filed a notice of intervention with the LPSC requesting further review prior to certifying the wholesale customer’s notice. The certification process is ongoing, and the LPSC procedural schedule extends into the third quarter of 2022. Cleco Power cannot predict the outcome of the process.
Failure to recontract this or other agreements may affect jurisdictional retail rates that will be subject to review by the LPSC in conjunction with Cleco Power’s next rate case. Within MISO, competitors are typically comprised of investor-owned utilities, independent power producers, power marketers, and power plant developers. These entities typically compete on the basis of price, reliability, and residual risk to the purchasing customer and its end users.
Cleco Power could experience some competition for electric sales to industrial customers in the form of cogeneration and from alternative and distributed energy power sources.
Customers
Cleco Power had one wholesale customer that accounted for 10.6% of its consolidated revenue in 2021. In 2021, this wholesale customer informed Cleco Power that it was not selected as a provider of load after the first quarter of 2024 and filed a notice with the LPSC to certify the results of the request for proposal. For more information, see “— Competition” above, and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview — Cleco Power — Other.” Cleco Power did not have a significant customer that accounted for 10% or more of its consolidated revenue in 2020 or 2019.

Fuel and Purchased Power 
Cleco Cajun uses coal and natural gas for its power generation resources. Cleco Cajun procures these fuels under contracts from a variety of suppliers and transporters. Cleco Cajun maintains an inventory of coal supply on-site at its coal generating facilities. 
Sales
Cleco Cajun sells wholesale electric supply in Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas. It furnishes supply to its wholesale customers primarily through all-requirements power supply and service agreements, which require Cleco Cajun to provide the electric capacity, energy, and other services necessary to serve most of its customers’ load requirements. Cleco Cajun procures the entirety of the power required to fulfill these obligations through its participation in the MISO market, and sells the entirety of power produced from its generating plants to the MISO market.
Cleco Cajun’s business experiences seasonality, as it bills its customers based on actual electric energy consumed. This usage tends to be greater during periods of high and low temperatures as compared to periods of moderate temperatures. 
Competition
Competition for Cleco Cajun’s customers is limited through the first quarter of 2025, when the majority of the wholesale electric supply contracts terminate. Cleco Cajun is currently participating in electric cooperative requests for proposals for capacity and energy after the first quarter of 2025. In 2020, a 

group of electric cooperatives, which are currently under contract with Cleco Cajun through the first quarter of 2025, conducted a request for proposal for capacity, energy, and resources beginning in the second quarter of 2025 in which Cleco Cajun participated. In March 2021, the group of electric cooperatives informed Cleco Cajun that it was not selected as a provider and filed a notice with the LPSC to certify the results of the request for proposal. Cleco Cajun subsequently filed a notice of intervention with the LPSC requesting further review prior to certifying the electric cooperatives’ notice. On January 25, 2022, the LPSC certified the electric cooperatives’ request, which did not include any of Cleco Cajun’s assets or contracts.
In 2021, a separate electric cooperative, which is currently under contract with Cleco Cajun through the first quarter of 2025, conducted a request for proposal for capacity and energy after March 27, 2025, in which Cleco Cajun participated. In August 2021, the electric cooperative informed Cleco Cajun that it was not selected as a provider, and filed a notice with the LPSC requesting certification of the results of the request for proposal. Cleco Cajun subsequently filed a notice of intervention with the LPSC requesting further review prior to the potential certification of the electric cooperative’s notice. The certification process is ongoing, and the LPSC procedural schedule extends into the third quarter of 2022. Cleco Cajun cannot predict the outcome of the process.
In 2021, an additional electric cooperative, which is currently under contract with Cleco Cajun through the first quarter of 2025, conducted a request for proposal for capacity and energy after March 31, 2025, in which Cleco Cajun participated. In December 2021, the electric cooperative

CLECO POWER | 2021 FORM 10-K

informed Cleco Cajun that it was not selected as a provider. As of March 7, 2022, the electric cooperative has not filed a notice with the LPSC requesting certification of the request for proposal results. Cleco Cajun will monitor the cooperative’s filing of a request for certification with the LPSC. 
Failure to recontract these and other existing agreements or failure to enter into new contracts to replace the existing contracts could have a material adverse effect on Cleco Cajun's results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows as early as the second quarter of 2025. Within MISO, competitors are typically comprised of investor-owned utilities, independent power producers, power marketers, and power plant developers. These entities typically compete on the basis of price, reliability, and residual risk to the purchasing customer and its end users.
Customers
Cleco Cajun did not have a significant customer that accounted for 10% or more of Cleco’s consolidated revenue in 2021, 2020, or 2019. For more information regarding Cleco Cajun’s sales and revenue, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations.”
Capital Expenditures
For information on Cleco Cajun’s capital expenditures and related matters, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Financial Condition — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Cash Generation and Cash Requirements — Capital Expenditures.”

REGULATORY MATTERS, INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENTS, AND FRANCHISES

Rates
Cleco Power’s electric operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the LPSC with respect to retail rates, standards of service, accounting, and other matters. Cleco Power is subject to the jurisdiction of FERC with respect to transmission tariffs, accounting, interconnections with other utilities, reliability, and the transmission of power. Periodically, Cleco Power has sought and received from both the LPSC and FERC increases in retail rates and transmission tariffs, respectively, to cover increases in operating costs and costs associated with additions to generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. 
Cleco Cajun is subject to the jurisdiction of FERC with respect to transmission tariffs, interconnections with other utilities, reliability, and the transmission of power. The rates Cleco, through Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun, charges its wholesale customers are subject to FERC’s triennial market power analysis. Cleco filed its most recent triennial power analysis in December 2020, and it is currently pending FERC approval. The next triennial market power analysis is expected to be filed in December 2023. 
Prior to July 1, 2021, Cleco Power’s annual retail earnings were subject to an FRP established by the LPSC in June 2014. The 2014 FRP allowed Cleco Power to earn a target ROE of 10.0%, while providing the opportunity to earn up to 10.9%. Additionally, 60.0% of retail earnings between 10.9% and 11.75%, and all retail earnings over 11.75%, were required to be refunded to customers. On June 16, 2021, the LPSC approved Cleco Power’s new retail rate plan. Effective July 1, 

2021, under the terms of the new retail rate plan, Cleco Power is allowed to earn a target ROE of 9.5%, while providing the opportunity to earn up to 10.0%. Additionally, 60.0% of retail earnings between 10.0% and 10.5% and all retail earnings over 10.5% are required to be refunded to customers. The amount of credits due to customers, if any, is determined by Cleco Power and the LPSC annually. Credits are typically included on customers’ bills the following summer, but the amount and timing of the refunds are ultimately subject to LPSC approval. Cleco Power’s next base rate case is required to be filed with the LPSC on or before March 31, 2023. For more information on the new FRP for Cleco Power, see Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Notes to the Financial Statements — Note 13 — Regulation and Rates — FRP.”
Generally, Cleco Power’s cost of fuel used for electric generation and the cost of purchased power are recovered through the LPSC-established FAC that enables Cleco Power to pass on to its customers substantially all such charges. Recovery of FAC costs is subject to periodic fuel audits by the LPSC. For more information on the FAC and the most recent fuel audit, see Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Notes to the Financial Statements — Note 15 — Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, and Disclosures about Guarantees — Litigation — LPSC Audits — Fuel Audit.”
In 2009, the LPSC issued Docket No. U-29380 Subdocket A, which provides Cleco Power an EAC to recover from its customers certain costs of environmental compliance. These expenses are eligible for recovery through Cleco Power’s EAC and are subject to periodic review by the LPSC. For more information on the EAC and the most recent environmental audit, see Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Notes to the Financial Statements — Note 15 — Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, and Disclosures about Guarantees — Litigation — LPSC Audits — Environmental Audit.” 
For information on the regulatory impacts of the TCJA on Cleco Power, see Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Notes to the Financial Statements — Note 13 — Regulation and Rates — TCJA.” 
For more information on Cleco Power’s retail rates, including Cleco Power’s FRP, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors — Regulatory Risks — Cleco Power’s Rates,” “— Retail Electric Service,” and “— LPSC Audits” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Financial Condition — Regulatory and Other Matters — Retail Rates of Cleco Power.” For more information on Cleco’s wholesale rates, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors — Regulatory Risks — Wholesale Electric Service” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Financial Condition — Regulatory and Other Matters — Wholesale Rates.”
Franchises
Cleco Power operates under nonexclusive franchise rights granted by governmental units, such as municipalities and parishes (counties), and enforced by state law. These franchises are for fixed terms, which vary from 10 years to more than 50 years. Historically, Cleco Power has been substantially successful in the timely renewal of franchises as each neared the end of its term. Cleco Power’s next municipal franchise expires in April 2022.

Industry Developments and Competition
For information on developments and competition within the electric utility industry, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Financial Condition — Regulatory and Other Matters — Market Structure.”
Legislative and Regulatory Changes and Matters
Various federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies are considering a number of issues that could shape the future of the electric utility industry. Such issues include, among others:
•the ability of electric utilities to recover stranded costs,
•the role of electric utilities, independent power producers, and competitive bidding in the purchase, construction, and operation of new generating capacity,
•the role of electric utilities and independent transmission providers in competitive bidding in the construction of new transmission facilities,
•the pricing of transmission service on an electric utility’s transmission system, or the cost of transmission services provided by an RTO/ISO,
•FERC’s assessment of market power and a utility’s ability to buy generation assets,
•mandatory transmission reliability standards,
•NERC’s imposition of additional reliability and cybersecurity standards,
•the authority of FERC to grant utilities the power of eminent domain,
•increasing requirements for renewable energy sources,
•demand response and energy efficiency standards,
•comprehensive environmental regulation in the areas of air, water, and waste, and
•FERC’s increased ability to impose financial penalties. 
At this time, management is unable to predict the outcome of such issues or the effects thereof on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.
For information on certain regulatory matters and regulatory accounting affecting Cleco, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Financial Condition — Regulatory and Other Matters.”

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Environmental Quality
Cleco is subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. Violations of these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines and penalties. Cleco has obtained the environmental permits necessary for its operations, and management believes Cleco is in compliance in all material respects with these permits, as well as all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Environmental requirements affecting electric power facilities are complex, change frequently, and have become more stringent over time as a result of new legislation, administrative actions, and judicial interpretations. Therefore, the capital costs and other expenditures necessary to comply with existing and new environmental requirements are difficult to determine. Cleco Power may request recovery of the costs to comply with certain environmental laws and regulations from its retail 

customers. If revenue relief were to be approved by the LPSC, then Cleco Power’s retail rates could increase. If the LPSC were to deny Cleco Power’s request to recover all or part of its environmental compliance costs, then Cleco Power would bear those costs directly. Such a decision could negatively impact the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. For Cleco Power’s expected capital expenditures related to environmental compliance in 2022, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Financial Condition — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Cash Generation and Cash Requirements — Capital Expenditures.” 
Air Quality
Air emissions from each of Cleco’s generating units are strictly regulated by the EPA and the LDEQ. The LDEQ has authority over and implements certain air quality programs established by the EPA under the federal CAA, as well as its own air quality regulations. The LDEQ establishes standards of performance and requires permits for EGUs in Louisiana. All of Cleco’s generating units are subject to these requirements.
The EPA has proposed and adopted rules under the authority of the CAA relevant to the emissions of SO2 and NOx from Cleco’s generating units. 
Regional Haze SIP
The CAA contains a regional haze program with the goal of returning Class I Federal areas of the nation to natural visibility by 2064. States are required to develop a SIP and revise it every ten years. The SIP must include requirements for the installation of Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) for applicable EGUs in Louisiana. The EPA issued a final approval of the Louisiana SIP for the first planning phase in December 2017. Although the approval was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit by multiple organizations, the court denied all the challenges to the EPA’s approval of the Louisiana Regional Haze SIP. Because the Louisiana SIP mandates use of existing controls and participation in the CSAPR as BART, Cleco does not believe the Louisiana SIP will have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. The second planning period for the regional haze program covers the period from 2018 through 2028 and requires states to adopt SIPs that make reasonable further progress toward achieving natural visibility conditions in Class I Federal areas. The LDEQ published a proposed SIP for the second planning period in April 2021 for public comment and it may be subject to revision upon further review by the LDEQ before it is submitted to the EPA. The proposal does not call for new controls on any state sources, but instead, it relies upon existing consent decrees and expected source retirements to achieve reasonable progress in reducing emissions and improving visibility in Class I Federal areas. The SIP for the second planning phase has not been submitted to the EPA. Until the LDEQ determines what the reasonable progress requirements are for Cleco units and completes its update of the SIP and the EPA approves the SIP, Cleco is unable to predict if the second phase SIP will have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.
Acid Rain Program
The CAA also established the Acid Rain Program to address the effects of acid rain and imposed restrictions on acid rain-causing SO2 emissions from certain generating units. The CAA 


15



CLECO | 
CLECO POWER | 2021 FORM 10-K

requires all of the regulated EGUs to possess a regulatory allowance for each ton of SO2 emitted beginning in the year 2000. The EPA allocates a set number of allowances to each affected unit based on its historic emissions. Cleco had sufficient allowances for operations in 2021 and expects to have sufficient allowances for 2022 operations under the Acid Rain Program.
The Acid Rain Program also established emission rate limits on NOx emissions for certain generating units. Compliance with the acid rain emission limits for NOx has been achieved at all affected facilities. 
CSAPR
In October 2016, the EPA published the finalized CSAPR update for the 2008 ozone NAAQS in the Federal Register (CSAPR Update Rule). As a result, the EPA proposed Federal Implementation Plans (FIP) that update the EGU CSAPR NOX ozone season emission budgets and implemented the budgets through the existing CSAPR NOX ozone season allowance trading program. The FIP required implementation beginning with the 2017 ozone season.
On September 13, 2019, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals partially remanded the CSAPR Update Rule to the EPA because the rule did not set a deadline by which upwind states must eliminate their significant contribution to downwind states’ NAAQS nonattainment. On April 30, 2021, the EPA issued in the Federal Register the final revised CSAPR update for the 2008 ozone NAAQS. Cleco does not expect the final regulation to have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flow of the Registrants.
In October 2015, the EPA promulgated a revision to the 2015 ozone NAAQS, lowering the level of both the primary and secondary standards to 70 ppb. Under the CAA, each state is required to submit a SIP that provides for the implementation, maintenance and enforcement of each primary and secondary NAAQS. In particular, each SIP must contain adequate provisions prohibiting emissions activity within the state, which will contribute significantly to non-attainment or interfere with maintenance by any other state with respect to any such primary or secondary ambient air quality standard. This “good neighbor” SIP is to be submitted to the EPA by the state within three years of promulgation of a new or revised NAAQS. The EPA determined that the SIP submittal by Louisiana meets the SIP completeness criteria. However, in February 2020, the EPA issued a proposed rule that indicated it would take separate actions on sub elements of the SIP that are to prohibit emissions to other states which will significantly contribute to nonattainment of the NAAQS and interfere with maintenance of the NAAQS. On October 15, 2021, the EPA published in the Federal Register a proposed consent decree that would establish a deadline for the EPA to approve or disapprove “good neighbor” SIP submittals by April 30, 2022, for a number of states including Louisiana. On January 12, 2022, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California entered the final consent decree establishing the deadlines for the EPA to approve or disapprove the SIP submittals. On February 22, 2022, the EPA issued a proposed disapproval of the “good neighbor” SIP submitted by Louisiana for the 2015 ozone NAAQS. If the EPA finalizes its proposed disapproval, the EPA may issue an FIP to address the “good neighbor” provision in Louisiana. Cleco is unable to predict the future impact of any requirements imposed under the “good neighbor” SIP or FIP for the 2015 ozone NAAQS.

MATS
For information about MATS, see Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Notes to the Financial Statements — Note 15 — Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, and Disclosures about Guarantees — Litigation — LPSC Audits — Environmental Audit.”
Combustion Turbine Hazardous Air Pollutants
On April 12, 2019, the EPA published in the Federal Register proposed amendments to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Stationary Combustion Turbines to address the results of the required periodic residual risk and technology review of the regulations. The EPA proposed to find that risks from this source category due to air toxics emissions are acceptable and that the existing rule provides an adequate margin of safety to protect public health. The EPA also identified no new cost-effective controls under the technology review that would achieve further emissions reductions from the source category. In addition, the EPA proposed to remove the stay of effectiveness of the emission standards for new lean premix and diffusion flame gas-fired turbines that had been promulgated in 2004. If the stay were lifted as proposed, emission limits could be applied to new or reconstructed lean premix and diffusion flame turbines. In the final rule, which was published in the Federal Register on March 9, 2020, the EPA did not take final action to lift the stay of effectiveness. However, on August 13, 2020, the EPA granted a petition for reconsideration of certain aspects of the EPA’s residual risk and technology review. The EPA indicated it will undertake a rulemaking to address issues in the petition, but also noted that a petition to delist the entire source category remains pending and their decision on that petition could impact this planned rulemaking. Until the EPA responds to the petitions, Cleco cannot determine if the rule will have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
CPP/ACE and NSPS
In August 2015, the EPA released the final guidelines referred to as the CPP. These guidelines provided each state with standards for CO2 emissions from the existing units of the state’s utility industry. The EPA derived the limits for each state through a strategy involving a combination of unit efficiency improvements, dispatching away from boilers to combined cycle units, and applying renewable energy. The CPP required significant reductions of CO2 emissions and set interim and final CO2 emission goals for each state. The interim emission goals were scheduled to begin in 2022, with final emission goals required by 2030. In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay of the CPP to remain in place until the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on the merits and any ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court.
In August 2015, the EPA released the NSPS rules for CO2 emissions from new, modified, or reconstructed units. The rules set requirements and conditions with respect to CO2 emission standards for new units and those that are modified or reconstructed. Cleco does not anticipate a modification or reconstruction of its existing sources that would trigger the application of the CO2 emission limits.
In March 2017, the executive order of Energy Independence was issued. Among other measures, the order directed the EPA to review the CPP, the proposed Federal Implementation Plan for the CPP, and the GHG NSPS. On July 8, 2019, the EPA published in the Federal Register a final rule 


16



CLECO | 
CLECO POWER | 2021 FORM 10-K

repealing the CPP and issuing a replacement to the CPP, informally known as the ACE Rule. The ACE Rule requires state agencies to set standards of performance for each affected generating unit and submit the implementation plan to the EPA for approval by July 8, 2022, with compliance expected within 24 months thereafter. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the EPA’s repeal of the CPP and its 2019 promulgation of ACE were unlawful. Therefore, the court issued an order to vacate and remand the ACE Rule to the EPA. On February 22, 2021, the court granted the EPA’s unopposed motion for a partial stay of the issuance of the mandate on vacating the CPP repeal, ordering that it will withhold issuance of the mandate with respect to the vacatur of the CPP repeal until the EPA responds to the court’s remand by promulgating a new rule to regulate GHG emissions from existing electric generating units. Therefore, the CPP will not take effect during the EPA’s rulemaking process. In addition, on March 5, 2021, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued the partial mandate effectuating the court’s vacatur of the ACE Rule that makes effective the court’s decision to vacate the ACE Rule. In April 2021, multiple parties filed petitions for a writ of certiorari asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review the decision by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. On October 29, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court granted four petitions for certiorari asking the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to review its decision to vacate and remand the ACE Rule.
On January 20, 2021, the Presidential administration issued an executive order, which directs federal agency heads to review regulations and other actions over the past four years to determine if they are inconsistent with the policies announced in the executive order. The administration also released a non-exhaustive list of agency actions to be reviewed, which includes the ACE Rule. Until the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals opinion has been determined to be final and the EPA has responded to the court’s opinion and executive order, management cannot determine the future regulatory requirements for GHGs for the utility industry and the potential impact on Cleco’s existing affected units. However, any new rules that require significant reductions in CO2 emissions for existing EGUs could require significant capital expenditures or curtailment of operations of certain EGUs to achieve compliance.
In December 2018, the EPA published proposed rules to replace the August 2015 NSPS rules for CO2 emissions from new, modified, or reconstructed units. As with the current NSPS rules, the proposed rules set requirements and conditions with respect to CO2 emission standards for new, modified, or reconstructed units. Cleco does not anticipate a future modification or future reconstruction of its existing units, as defined in the proposal, which would trigger the application of the proposed CO2 emission limits. Until the EPA finalizes the rule, management cannot state what the final standards will entail or if the new rule will have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.
Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS)
The enactment of federal or state RPS mandating the use of renewable and alternative fuel sources such as wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal energy could result in certain changes in Cleco’s business or its competitive position. These changes could include additional costs for renewable energy credits, alternate compliance payments, or capital expenditures for renewable generation resources. RPS 

legislation has been enacted in many states, and Congress is considering various bills that would create a national RPS. Cleco continues to evaluate the impacts of potential RPS legislation on its business based on the RPS programs in other states.
NAAQS
A primary NAAQS for NO2 promulgated by the EPA became effective in April 2010. The EPA established a new one-hour standard at a level of 100 ppb to supplement the existing annual standard. In 2012, the EPA determined that no area in the country was violating the standard. In April 2018, the EPA published, following the required review of the NAAQS, a final action that retains the ambient air standards for NO2. The EPA may redesignate areas based on new data it receives from states. Due to the fact that fossil fuel-fired EGUs are a significant source of NO2 emissions in the country, a non-attainment designation could result in utilities such as Cleco being required to substantially reduce their NO2 emissions. However, because the EPA has not yet completed any new designations, Cleco cannot predict the likelihood or potential impacts of such a rule on its generating units at this time.
The EPA revised the NAAQS for SO2 in June 2010. The new standard is now a one-hour health standard of 75 ppb, designed to reduce short-term exposures to SO2 ranging from five minutes to 24 hours. An important aspect of the new SO2 standard is a revised emission monitoring network combined with a new ambient air modeling approach to determine compliance with the new standard. In January 2018, the EPA published a final rule designating all areas containing Cleco generation facilities as either attainment/unclassifiable or unclassifiable. Therefore, there is no adverse impact to Cleco’s generating units.
On March 18, 2019, the EPA published, following the required review of the NAAQS, a final action that retains the ambient air standards for SO2. The EPA may redesignate areas based on new data it receives from states. Due to the fact that fossil fuel-fired EGUs are a significant source of SO2 emissions in the country, a non-attainment designation could result in utilities such as Cleco being required to substantially reduce their SO2 emissions. However, because the EPA has not yet completed any new designations, Cleco cannot predict the likelihood or potential impacts of such a rule on its generating units at this time.
On December 18, 2020, after a required review, the EPA published a final rule that retains NAAQS for particulate matter (PM), which was last revised in 2012. Cleco’s generation facilities are not located in areas designated as nonattainment of the PM NAAQS. Therefore, there is no adverse impact to Cleco’s generating units.
On December 21, 2020, after a required review, the EPA published a final rule that retains the NAAQS for ozone, which was last revised in 2015. Cleco’s generation facilities are not located in areas designated as nonattainment of the ozone NAAQS but, as discussed with respect to CSAPR, a SIP or FIP addressing the “good neighbor” obligations for Louisiana for the 2015 ozone NAAQS has not yet been finalized. Therefore, Cleco is unable to predict the future impact of any requirements imposed under a “good neighbor” SIP or FIP for the 2015 ozone NAAQS.

Other
On May 2, 2019, Louisiana Generating notified the EPA and the LDEQ that it has elected not to Retrofit (as such term is defined in the Consent Decree) Big Cajun II, Unit 1.
Water Quality
Cleco’s facilities are subject to federal and state laws and regulations regarding wastewater discharges. Cleco has received, from the EPA and the LDEQ, permits required under the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) for wastewater discharges from its generating stations. Wastewater discharge permits have fixed dates of expiration, and Cleco applies for renewal of these permits within the applicable time periods.
In March 2011, the EPA proposed regulations that would establish standards for cooling water intake structures at existing power plants and other facilities pursuant to Section 316(b) of the CWA. The EPA published its final rule in August 2014. The standards are intended to protect fish and other aquatic wildlife by minimizing capture, both in screens attached to intake structures (impingement mortality) and in the actual intake structures themselves (entrainment mortality). The final rule (1) sets a performance standard, dealing with fish impingement mortality or reduce the flow velocity at cooling water intakes to less than 0.5 feet per second and (2) requires entrainment standards to be determined on a case-by-case basis by state-delegated permitting authorities. Facilities subject to the standards are required to complete a number of studies within a 45-month period and then comply with the rule as soon as possible after the next discharge permit renewal, by a date determined by the permitting authorities. Portions of the final rule could apply to a number of Cleco’s fossil fuel steam electric generating stations. Until the required studies are conducted, including technical and economic evaluations of the control options available, and regulatory agency officials have reviewed the studies and made determinations, Cleco remains uncertain as to which technology options or retrofits will be required to be installed on its affected facilities. The costs of required technology options and retrofits may be significant, particularly if closed cycle cooling is required.
The CWA requires the EPA to periodically review and, if appropriate, revise technology-based effluent limitations guidelines for categories of industrial facilities, including power generating facilities. In November 2015, the EPA released the Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Steam Electric Power Generating Point Source Category Rule (ELG Rule). The rule is focused on reducing the discharge of metals in wastewater from generating facilities to surface waters. 
On October 13, 2020, the EPA published final revisions to the ELG Rule that revised the technology-based effluent limitation guidelines and standards applicable to flue gas desulfurization and bottom ash transport waste waters. The revised ELG Rule, known as the Reconsideration Rule, also allows a unit to come into compliance with the ELG Rule by qualifying as an electric generating unit that will achieve permanent cessation of coal combustion by December 31, 2028. Under this compliance option, Cleco submitted a Notice of Planned Participation by the October 13, 2021, submittal deadline for the Dolet Hills Power Station, Rodemacher Unit 2, and Big Cajun II, Unit 1. The rule may require costly technological upgrades at Cleco’s facilities, particularly if additional wastewater treatment systems are required to be installed or if waste streams must be eliminated. Until Cleco and the agencies have come to an agreement on how compliance with the rule will be achieved, management cannot 

predict what the final standards will entail, what controls the EPA and the state of Louisiana may require of Cleco, or if the rule will have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.
On January 20, 2021, the Presidential administration issued an executive order, which directs federal agency heads to review regulations and other actions over the past four years to determine if they are inconsistent with the policies announced in the executive order. The administration also released a non-exhaustive list of agency actions to be reviewed, which includes the ELG Rule.
Solid Waste Disposal
In the course of operations, Cleco’s facilities generate solid and hazardous waste materials requiring eventual disposal. The Solid Waste Division of the LDEQ has adopted a permitting system for the management and disposal of solid waste generated by power stations. Cleco has received all required permits from the LDEQ for the on-site disposal of solid waste from its generating stations.
In April 2015, the EPA published a final rule in the Federal Register for regulating the disposal and management of CCRs from coal-fired power plants (CCR Rule). The CCR Rule establishes extensive requirements for existing and new CCR landfills and surface impoundments and all lateral expansions consisting of location restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring and corrective action, closure requirements and post closure care, and recordkeeping, notification, and internet posting requirements. In August 2018, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated several requirements in the CCR Rule, which included eliminating the previous acceptability of compacted clay material as a liner for impoundments. As a result, in December 2019, the EPA published a proposed rule that would set deadlines for costly modifications including retrofitting of clay-lined impoundments with compliant liners or closure of the impoundments. The CCR Rule was finalized and published in the Federal Register on August 28, 2020. In November 2020, Cleco submitted demonstrations to the EPA specifying its intended course of action for the ash disposal facilities at Rodemacher Unit 2, Dolet Hills Power Station, and Big Cajun II in order to comply with the final CCR Rule. The demonstrations are subject to EPA approval.
On January 20, 2021, the Presidential administration issued an executive order, which directs federal agency heads to review regulations and other actions over the past four years to determine if they are inconsistent with the policies announced in the executive order. The administration also released a nonexhaustive list of agency actions to be reviewed, which includes the CCR rules promulgated in July 2018, August 2020, and November 2020. The EPA has completed its review of the three CCR rules in response to the executive order and has determined that the most environmentally protective course is to implement the rules.
As a result of solid waste disposal regulations, Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun have AROs for the retirement of certain ash disposal facilities. All costs of the CCR Rule for Cleco Power are expected to be recovered from its customers in future rates. The actual asset retirement costs related to the CCR Rule requirements may vary substantially from the estimates used to record the increased obligation due to the uncertainty about the compliance strategies that will be used and the preliminary nature of available data used to estimate costs. Cleco will continue to gather additional data in future

periods and will make decisions about compliance strategies and the timing of closure activities. As additional information becomes available and management makes decisions about compliance strategies and the timing of closure activities, Cleco will update the ARO balances to reflect these changes in estimates. For more information on Cleco’s compliance strategies and financial impacts of the CCR Rule, see Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to the Financial Statements — Note 15 — Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, and Disclosures about Guarantees — Other Commitments.” For more information on the regulatory treatment of Cleco Power’s AROs, see Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Notes to the Financial Statements — Note 6 — Regulatory Assets and Liabilities — AROs.”
In December 2016, the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN Act), including the WIIN Act’s provisions regarding CCRs, was signed into law. The WIIN Act’s CCR provisions require the EPA to establish a CCR permitting program. It also allows for implementation of the federal CCR Rule through a state-based permit program. On February 20, 2020, the EPA published in the Federal Register a proposed rule establishing the federal permit program. Permits will be required for all CCR units in states that do not have state permit programs. Until the state of Louisiana has evaluated the WIIN Act and made a decision on implementing a state-based option, Cleco cannot determine if there will be a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.
Cleco produces certain wastes that are classified as hazardous at its electric generating stations and at other locations. Cleco does not treat, store long-term, or dispose of these wastes on-site; therefore, no permits are required. Hazardous wastes produced by Cleco are properly disposed of at permitted hazardous waste disposal sites.
Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)
The TSCA directs the EPA to regulate the marketing, disposing, manufacturing, processing, distributing in commerce, and usage of various toxic substances, including PCBs. Cleco operates and may continue to operate equipment containing PCBs under the TSCA. Once the equipment reaches the end of its useful life, the EPA regulates handling and disposing of the equipment and fluids containing PCBs. Within these regulations, handling and disposing is allowed only through facilities approved and permitted by the EPA. Cleco properly disposes of its PCB waste material at TSCA-permitted disposal facilities.
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA)
The CERCLA imposes liability on parties responsible for, in whole or in part, the presence of hazardous substances at a site. In 2007, Cleco received a Special Notice for Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) from the EPA for a facility known as the Devil’s Swamp Lake site located just northwest of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The notice requested that Cleco and Cleco Power, along with many other listed potentially responsible parties (PRP), enter into negotiations with the EPA for the performance of an RI/FS at the Devil’s Swamp Lake site. In 2008, the EPA identified Cleco as one of many companies that sent PCB wastes for disposal to the site. The EPA proposed to add the Devil’s Swamp Lake site to the National Priorities List, based on the release of PCBs to 

fisheries and wetlands located on the site, but no final listing decision has been made. The EPA issued a Unilateral Administrative Order to two PRPs, Clean Harbors, Inc. and Baton Rouge Disposal, to conduct an RI/FS in 2009. The Tier 1 part of the study was completed in June 2012. The tier 2 remedial investigation report was made public in December 2015. In September 2019, the EPA publicly announced a proposed cleanup strategy for the Superfund Site. Until a final plan is presented by the EPA, management is unable to determine how significant Cleco’s share of the costs associated with a possible response action at the site, if any, may be and whether this will have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.
Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA)
Section 313 of the EPCRA requires certain facilities that manufacture, process, or otherwise use minimum quantities of listed toxic chemicals to file an annual report with the EPA called a Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) report. The TRI report requires industrial facilities to report on approximately 650 substances that the facilities release into the air, water, and land. The TRI report ranks companies based on the amount of a particular substance they release on a state and parish (county) level. Annual reports are due to the EPA on July 1 following the reporting year-end. Cleco has submitted required TRI reports on its activities, and the TRI rankings are available 
to the public. The rankings do not result in any federal or state penalties. 
Electric and Magnetic Fields (EMFs)
The possibility that exposure to EMFs emanating from electric power lines, household appliances, and other electric devices may result in adverse health effects and damage to the environment has been a subject of some public attention. Lawsuits alleging that the presence of electric power transmission and distribution lines has an adverse effect on health and/or property values have arisen in several states. Neither Cleco nor Cleco Power are parties in any lawsuits related to EMFs.
