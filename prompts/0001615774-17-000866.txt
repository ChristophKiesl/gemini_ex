Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Background
 
We were formed as a Delaware corporation on June 20, 2014 for the purpose of engaging in the business of recycling lead through a novel, proprietary and patent-pending process that we developed and named “AquaRefining”. Since our formation, we have focused our efforts on the development and testing of our AquaRefining process, the development of our business plan, the raise of our present working capital and the development of our initial lead acid battery, or LAB, recycling facility in the Tahoe Regional Industrial Center, McCarran, Nevada (“TRIC”).
 
We have completed the development of our initial LAB recycling facility at TRIC and commenced the commercial scale production of recycled lead during January 2017. We expect TRIC to achieve a production rate of 120 metric tons of recycled lead per day during 2017. Unless otherwise indicated, the terms “Aqua Metals”, “Company”, “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Aqua Metals, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
 
All references in this report to “ton” or “tonne” refer to a metric ton, which is equal to approximately 2,204.6 pounds.
 
Since our organization in 2014, we have engaged in several capital raising transactions, which are summarized below in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - General.”
 
Overview
 
Aqua Metals is reinventing lead recycling with its patent-pending AquaRefining™ technology. Unlike smelting, AquaRefining is a room temperature, water-based process that is fundamentally non-polluting. It is deployed as a factory built modular system which allows the lead-acid battery industry to simultaneously improve environmental impact and scale production to meet rapidly growing demand. Aqua Metals is based in Alameda, California, and has built its first recycling facility in Nevada's Tahoe Reno Industrial Complex. Lead is a globally traded commodity with a worldwide market value in excess of $20 billion. Lead acid batteries (LABs) are the primary use of all lead produced in the world. Because the chemical properties of lead allow it to be recycled and reused indefinitely, LABs are also the dominant source of world lead production. As such, LABs are almost 100% recycled for purposes of capturing the lead contained therein for re-use. We believe that our proprietary AquaRefining process will provide for the recycling of LABs and the production of a pure grade lead with a significantly lower cost of production, and with fewer environmental and regulatory issues, than conventional methods of lead production.
 
In recent years, many lead-zinc mines have become exhausted and recycled lead has become increasingly important to LAB production. Recycled lead surpassed mined lead in the 1990s and now represents more than 60% of the lead content in new LABs. Whether it is produced from lead ore or recycled LABs, lead has historically been produced by smelting. Smelting is a high-temperature, metallurgic/chemical reduction, somewhat inefficient, energy intensive and often a highly pollutive process. As a consequence of its environmental and health issues, lead smelting has become increasingly regulated in many countries. In the US, regulatory non-compliance has forced the closure of large lead smelters in Vernon, California, Frisco, Texas and Herculaneum, Missouri over the last four years. Herculaneum was the last remaining primary lead-mine operation (i.e., smelting lead from concentrates/ore) in the US, though secondary lead smelters that process recycled lead continue to operate in the US. In response to increasing environmental regulation over the past two decades, there has been an expansion of LAB smelting capacity in Mexico and other less regulated countries. The resulting transportation of used LABs from where they originate in the US to smelters in Mexico, South Korea, the Philippines and elsewhere is an increasingly significant logistical and global environmental cost.
 
AquaRefining uses bio-degradable aqueous solvent and a novel ambient temperature electro-chemical process to produce pure lead (i.e., higher than 99.99% purity). We believe that AquaRefining can significantly reduce production costs as compared with alternative methods of producing pure lead. This cost reduction is partly because our novel electro-chemical process requires less energy than the endothermic high temperature (1400°C) chemical reduction that is at the core of smelting. It is also partly because our process does not generate toxic high temperature dust and gas, or the lead containing slag and dross that are unavoidable byproducts of smelting, and which require capital and energy intensive processes to meet environmental compliance. We also have the potential to locate multiple smaller recycling facilities in areas closer to the source of used LABs, thereby reducing transport costs and supply chain bottlenecks. On this basis, we believe that it significantly reduces environmental emissions, health concerns and permitting needs as compared with lead smelting. We believe that the combined advantages offered by AquaRefining represent a potential step change in lead recycling technology, one that can deliver advantages in economics, footprint and logistics while greatly reducing the environmental impact of lead recycling.

The modular nature of AquaRefining makes it possible to start LAB recycling at a much smaller scale than is possible with smelters, thereby significantly reducing the investment risk associated with building a lead production facility. Our plan is to actively explore distributed recycling in the US beginning with our initial recycling operation near Reno, Nevada. This plan is based on our belief that Reno has become a significant hub of the West Coast’s LAB distribution infrastructure and yet is very poorly served by the LAB recycling industry. From our initial recycling facility near Reno, we intend to expand first throughout the US and then overseas. We seek to develop additional recycling facilities, including facilities that we will own directly and facilities to be developed in association with third parties through joint ventures, licensing and direct sales.
 
Our Markets
 
The Lead Market
 
Lead is a globally traded commodity and the essential component of over 95% of the world’s rechargeable batteries. Lead is traded primarily on the London Metals Exchange, or LME, although the smaller Shanghai Metals Exchange (SHME) also trades the element. Conventionally in the industry, there are two separate groupings of lead: i) primary lead which refers to lead produced at smelters that use mined lead concentrates (generally lead sulfide) as their primary feedstock, and ii) secondary lead which refers to lead smelters utilizing LABs as their main feed source.
 
Originally, the majority of the lead used in batteries was sourced from primary smelters but in recent decades, secondary lead has grown to become the dominate product used. Industry data shows that six million metric tons of lead was produced in 1995 of which approximately 45% was primary and 55% was from secondary sources. Twenty years later, by 2015, global lead production had increased to approximately 11 million metric tons, of which more than 65% was secondary. Importantly, primary lead production had increased only marginally during this period. This marginal increase is because lead-zinc mine deposits are being depleted across the globe. As such, an increasing quantity of primary lead is now the predominate byproduct of zinc mining.
 
In 2005, secondary lead traded on the LME in a range of $1,000 to $1,200 per metric ton. During 2015 and 2016, secondary lead traded in a range of $1,554 to $2,456 per metric ton.
 
As noted above, although lead is traded as a commodity on the LME/SHME, the major sales are the sales directly between producers and users. The LME daily price is used as the benchmark in forming the basis of physical trades, forward contracts and hedge strategies for both primary and secondary lead. Based on market knowledge with buyers of lead in the US and Global lead markets, different grades (termed alloys) of lead are traded at a premium to the LME price. (Note: Lead by-products can trade at a discount to the LME).

Lead Smelting
 
Currently, smelters produce virtually all the world’s mined and recycled lead. Smelting is an inefficient, energy intensive and often highly polluting process. At its core, smelting is a high temperature (excess of 10400°C) metallurgical reduction process in which lead compounds are heated and reacted with various reducing agents to remove the oxygen, sulfur, and other impurities.  The process leaves behind a bullion lead and waste slag. The chemical reactions are generally endothermic, which means that heat must be continually supplied to replace the energy consumed by the reduction processes. In smelting, depending upon the operation 0.5% to 5% of the lead is lost in the “slag”, with the resultant lead bullion containing both wanted and unwanted impurities. Importantly, smelting is only cost effective at large scale, typically more than 200 metric tons of lead per day.


In addition to the high costs and inefficiencies associated with smelting, it can generate large volumes of toxic solid, liquid, particulate and gaseous waste. In developed countries, there is both increased environmental regulation and enforcement of such, including monitoring of permissible blood lead levels in employees and local populations. These regulations and the increasing enforcement have made it more expensive to operate smelters. According to a report titled “Hazardous Trade?” produced by the Secretariat of the Commission for Environmental Cooperation in 2013, this has led to a decline of lead smelters in the U.S., an expansion of smelting operations in Mexico and a resultant increase in the export of used LABs from the U.S. followed by the re-import of recycled lead. This trade is believed to be largely driven by the lower costs related to the less stringent environmental standards and enforcement in Mexico. For the foregoing reasons, we believe that lead smelting facilities are increasingly located in poorly regulated areas remote from both the source of used LABs and the demand for lead. We believe that the remote location of smelting increases the transport costs to the production of recycled lead.
 
Lead Acid Batteries
 
Although the LAB is one of the earliest battery technology, in terms of capacity deployed and manufacturing capacity it dominates the battery industry.  Historically, the largest market for LABs has been as starter batteries for vehicles.  However, with the increasing electrical load on modern vehicles and the adoption of “Stop-Start” conventional 12V “starter batteries” are evolving into more capable and higher value products.  At the same time, large new markets such as Cell Tower, Data Center and Industrial back-up are adding to demand.  Consequently, existing LAB production facilities are being expanded and new facilities are being built.

According to CHR Metals, total lead output in 2017 will be 20% higher than it was in 2012. Similarly, articles published in the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal support continued growth in demand for lead for at least the next 20 years as car ownership increases rapidly in developing nations. The battery market for electric e-bikes and scooters in China is one example of a recent and rapidly growing application for LABs. This has grown from minimal roots in 2005 to accounting for over 15% of LAB production in 2012. There are now over 150 million e-bikes and scooters on the road in China, and nearly all of them are powered by LABs. We believe that grid storage and other energy storage applications linked to renewable energy (solar and wind) will also generate increased demand for LABs, where low cost, safety and reliability will make them attractive options.
 
The increase in LAB manufacturing in general and particularly in China, India and Southeast Asia, has increased demand for lead, putting pressure on global recycling networks to meet this demand. At present, we believe that many of the LAB recycling performed outside of the U.S., Canada, the EU, Japan, and Australia is carried out in outdated facilities with poor environmental standards and insufficient enforcement. China, India, Pakistan and South America appear to be moving toward tougher regulation and enforcement. We believe that this will drive a demand in foreign markets for more less polluting LAB recycling processes.
 
Our Business Model
 
The market for lead is global in scale but local in nature and execution, with large differences in local regulation, custom and practice. In some regions, it is highly regulated, and in others it is not. Consequently, we have developed our business model to commercialize our technology optimally across multiple countries.
 
In the US and similarly regulated countries, our plan is to build and operate LAB recycling facilities, both directly and in association with third parties through joint ventures, licensing and direct sales. As an example, on February 7, 2017, we entered into a series of agreements with Johnson Controls Inc., (Johnson Controls), pursuant to which, among other things, we agreed to work with Johnson Controls on the development of a program for the installation of new greenfield builds and conversion of Johnson Controls and certain strategic partners of Johnson Controls’ existing lead smelters throughout North America, China and Europe to a lead recycling process utilizing our proprietary and patent-pending AquaRefining technology and equipment, know-how and services.
 
Through our relationships with Battery Systems Inc., Interstate Battery System International, Inc., and Johnson Controls, we believe we are now able to pursue our expansion of our directly-owned recycling facilities in the U.S. subject to our receipt of necessary funding. Our plan is to locate our facilities close to the regional supplies of used LABs that we have secured with these relationships. Additionally, through the supply and off-take relationships that we have established with Battery Systems, Inc., Interstate Battery and Johnson Controls, we believe we are better positioned to acquire the necessary funding, including potential forms of non-diluting financing, in order to finance our next facilities.
 
Lead recycling is subject to a variety of domestic and international regulations related to hazardous materials, emissions, employee safety and other matters. While our operations will be subject to these regulations, we believe that one of our potential advantages will be our ability to conduct lead recycling operations with less regulatory cost and burden than smelting operators. One of our key objectives will be to educate regulators and the public as to the environmental benefits of AquaRefining. We believe we have the potential to develop a business model that offers both strong economics and the opportunity to conduct in a socially responsible manner an important recycling activity that to date has been conducted in an inefficient, energy intensive and often highly polluting manner.
 
AquaRefining Process
 
We developed AquaRefining to be a less expensive, cleaner and modular alternative to smelting. Our process has two key elements, both of which are integral to our pending-patent application. The first is our use of a proprietary, non-toxic solvent that dissolves lead compounds. The second is a proprietary electro-chemical process and electrolyzer that converts the dissolved lead compounds into pure, primary grade lead on a fully automated basis.
 
Similar to conventional LAB recycling, our AquaRefining process begins with the crushing of used LABs and the separation of the metallic lead, active material (lead compounds), sulfuric acid and plastic for recycling. The active material is dissolved in our solvent. The primary lead is then stripped from the solvent using our patent pending and fully automated process allowing the solvent to be reused continuously and indefinitely.

Our AquaRefining process generates the following outputs:
 

· | Lead and lead-based products, including high purity lead, lead alloys and lead compounds which are primarily intended for the LAB industry. We are also exploring higher value lead based products which may offer performance and life-cycle benefits to the LAB industry;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Recovered plastic chips, intended for re-use in the manufacture of battery casings and other plastic products; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Sodium sulfate and sulfuric acid.
--+----------------------------------

 
We expect to derive revenue primarily from the sale of lead based products, with additional revenue derived from the sale of cleaned plastic chips and sulfuric acid expected to be modest.
 
A significant benefit of our AquaRefining process is that it is capable of producing high purity (primary grade) lead, without the need for the highly energy intensive and wasteful thermal processing that is required by conventional smelted lead. However, selling primary grade lead is performed directly with battery companies, which requires a review and testing process. We expect that this approval process will take at least 12 months and there is no guarantee of success. For this reason, we have not included the premiums available through the sale of primary lead in our financial modeling or cash flow planning.
 
Another significant benefit of our process is that we designed the equipment used in the process to be manufactured on a purpose-built production line in standard sized modules. This is not possible with the smelting process, as smelters need to be constructed on site. This gives us the ability to provide AquaRefining systems with capacities ranging from four metric tons per day to 400 metric tons per day or more all based on our standard factory produced module.
 
Our First Recycling Facility: McCarran, Nevada
 
We have developed our initial LAB recycling facility near Reno, Nevada. In May 2015, we purchased 11.73 acres of undeveloped land for the purchase price of $1.0 million.
 
In August 2015, we commenced construction of a 136,750 square foot LAB recycling facility at our TRIC property. The building phase was completed by August 2016 at which time, we started commissioning activities. We produced our first AquaRefined lead in October 2016 and we verified that the lead produced by AquaRefining is over 99.99 percent pure.
 
During late 2016, we implemented upgrades to the facility that have resulted in an initial production capacity of 120 metric tons per day of lead based products. Our facility is designed to accommodate additional AquaRefining modules to support expansion to 160 tonnes of lead products per day.
 
We commenced initial battery breaking during December 2016 and progressed to regular single shift operation of the battery breaker in January 2017.
 
In connection with the permitting of our TRIC facility, the Nevada state environmental regulators determined that our AquaRefining process is not subject to National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, or NESHAP rules. NESHAP is the federal emissions standards set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, which apply to conventional smelter-based recycling facilities. We believe this is an important precedent which could substantially reduce both the time required to obtain permits and increase the options for locating additional facilities for both us and our potential licensees.
 
Supply, Off-Take and Other Strategic Agreements 
 
We have entered into a series of agreements and relationships providing for our supply of LABs and the off-take of the recycled lead we produce. As described in more detail below, Interstate Battery has agreed to supply us with LABs pursuant to a written agreement entered into in May 2016. In addition, we have established an important relationship Battery Systems. Inc., an independent LAB distributor with a distribution facility located next to our TRIC facility, for Battery Systems’ supply of used LABS to us. We have also entered into an agreement with Johnson Controls pursuant to which Johnson Controls has agreed to purchase from us, recycled lead on both a tolling (fee to convert used LABs to recycled materials) and merchanting (sale of recycled materials) basis. Consequently, we believe that we have secured an ample supply of used LABs and demand for our lead based products for the foreseeable future. In addition, we entered into a separate agreement with Johnson Controls pursuant to which we agreed to work with Johnson Controls on the development of a program for the installation of new greenfield builds and conversion of Johnson Controls and certain strategic partners of Johnson Controls existing lead smelters throughout North America, China and Europe to a lead recycling process utilizing our proprietary and patent-pending AquaRefining technology and equipment, know-how and services.

Johnson Control Agreements
 
Equipment Supply Agreement. We entered into an equipment supply agreement dated February 7, 2017 with Johnson Controls pursuant to which we agreed to collaborate on the development of a program for the installation of new greenfield builds and conversion of existing Johnson Controls and certain strategic partners of Johnson Controls’ existing lead smelters to a lead recycling process utilizing our proprietary and patent-pending AquaRefining technology and equipment, know-how and services. We have agreed with Johnson Controls to develop an appropriate program blueprint, and enter into a definitive development program agreement reflecting that blueprint, pursuant to which we will provide to Johnson Controls and certain strategic partners of Johnson Controls, by way of licensing or sale, the following products and services in the regions of North America, Europe and China:

· | AquaRefining technology and the related equipment, engineering and systems integration support sufficient to convert or retrofit existing smelter-based operations and/or the construction of new Johnson Controls and Johnson Controls’ strategic partners’ battery recycling facilities based on our AquaRefining technology;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Training, evaluation and certification of Johnson Controls’ operations personnel sufficient for such personnel to competently operate our AquaRefining technology and equipment; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ongoing technical support, maintenance services and warranties.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 
We will provide the above services and equipment to Johnson Controls on a serviced license basis, including Johnson Controls’ ongoing licensing fees payable to us based on the operational capacity of the AquaRefining equipment supplied by us. We have agreed not to license our AquaRefining technology and equipment to third parties in the aforementioned regions until such as we and Johnson Controls have agreed on certain matters relating to the initial conversion of a Johnson Controls facility. The equipment supply agreement may be terminated by either party upon 60 days’ prior written notice if the parties have not entered into the blueprint agreement by a mutually agreed date. The equipment supply agreement allows each party the right to seek early termination based on a material breach by the other party that goes uncorrected for 30 days following notice of breach. The equipment supply agreement contains representations, warranties and indemnities that are customary to commercial agreements of this nature.
 
Tolling/Lead Purchase Agreement. We have entered into a tolling/lead purchase agreement dated February 7, 2017 with Johnson Controls pursuant to which we have agreed to sell to Johnson Controls, and Johnson Controls has agreed to purchase from us, recycled lead on both a tolling (fee to convert used LABs to recycled materials) and merchanting (sale of recycled materials) basis.
 
Pursuant to the agreement, Johnson Controls has agreed to purchase from us, and we have agreed to sell to Johnson Controls, up to 100% of the recycled lead we produce for automotive applications, other than by way of tolling arrangements, on a monthly basis, unless we receive notice from Johnson Controls six months advance of its intention to purchase less than 100% of our output in any given month. Our agreement with Johnson Controls excludes, and we are free to manufacture and sell to third parties, recycled lead for non-automotive uses, such as stationery batteries for back-up power systems for Internet/Cloud applications or grid scale storage applications.
 
We have also agreed to provide tolling services to Johnson Controls whereby Johnson Controls will deliver to us used lead acid batteries, or LABs, and we will recycle the used LABs and return the recycled lead to Johnson Controls for a fee. Johnson Controls has agreed to send to us for tolling, and we have agreed to toll for Johnson Controls, used LABs representing a significant allocation of the production capacity of our initial recycling facility in McCarran, Nevada.
 
The tolling/lead purchase agreement has a minimum term of five years and upon the expiration of the initial term the agreement extends each day for another three years. Either party may elect to terminate the agreement for any reason after the second anniversary of the agreement, which termination shall be effective on the third anniversary of the notice of termination. Either party may terminate the agreement on ten days’ prior written notice of breach that goes uncorrected during the notice period. The tolling/lead purchase agreement contains representations, warranties and indemnities that are customary to commercial agreements of this nature.
 
Interstate Battery Partnership
 
On May 18, 2016, we entered into a supply agreement with Interstate Battery pursuant to which Interstate Battery agreed to sell to us, and we agreed to buy from Interstate Battery, used LABs. Interstate Battery will sell us used LABs on a cost-plus basis and the agreement subjects us and Interstate Battery to certain minimum purchase and sale requirements. We have granted Interstate Battery limited rights of first refusal to supply our future AquaRefineries. Our agreement with Interstate Battery is for an initial term of 18 months and will be subject to automatic renewals thereafter unless either party elects to terminate the agreement. The agreement allows each party the right to seek early termination based on certain commercial contingencies. The supply agreement contains representations, warranties and indemnities that are customary to commercial agreements of this nature.

Competition
 
As of the date of this report, we are not aware of any commercially viable alternative to smelting for LAB recycling in operation, except for one variation on smelting that uses a thermal lance to provide the heat. This process, known as Isamelt, has some limited advantages over smelting but has not been widely taken up, although it has been in existence for over 20 years. In addition, several years ago, Engitec Technologies S.p.A. developed an electro-refining process as an alternative to smelting for lead ore. The process is known as the Flubor process and uses fluoboric acid as an electrolyte. We believe The Doe Run Company, a US-based operator of lead smelters, evaluated this process for the production of primary lead, however, to our knowledge, the Flubor process has never been used in commercial lead recycling by The Doe Run Company or anyone else.
 
We believe that our primary competition in the production of lead may come from operators of existing smelters and other parties heavily invested in the existing supply chain for smelting, both of which may resist the change presented by AquaRefining. Competition from such incumbents may come in the form of price competition for lead produced, however to the extent we are successful in being a low cost producer of higher quality lead coupled with continued growth of our licensing and partnership efforts, we should be able to compete effectively.
 
Another area where incumbents may seek to compete is in controlling access to used LABs. The market for used LABs is made up of the members of the LAB reverse supply chains, including auto repair shops, auto parts stores and auto dealers, LAB manufacturers who operate their own smelting operations and third parties who engage in the purchase and sale of used LABs. We believe that some LAB manufacturers who maintain their own smelting operations may feel significantly threatened by our AquaRefining process. Such parties may attempt to restrict our access to used LABs; however, we believe these LAB manufacturers only control approximately 50% of the market for used LABs, leaving us with significant access to LABs even if these parties do attempt to interfere. We have assumed at least some level of interference by incumbents, however, as described above, we have contracted with Interstate Battery and Johnson Controls for their supply of used LABs to us. We are also in discussions with additional potential suppliers of used LABs. On the basis of these agreements and discussions, we do not view access to used LABs be a significant risk to our LAB recycling operations.
 
While we had assumed that smelters might be resistant, at least at first, to AquaRefining, we have received preliminary inquiries from a number of existing operators of lead smelters who are interested in augmenting their existing capacity or replacing it entirely with our AquaRefining modules. However, our business plan is not dependent or even focused on the acceptance of our process by lead smelters. We still intend to initially focus on operating our AquaRefining facilities directly and working with our first licensee, Johnson Controls, to implement Aqua Refining in a nominated lead smelting facility followed by deployments with additional 3rd parties to propagate AquaRefining as the technology of choice for recycling LABs.
 
We do not expect to experience significant competition in connection with our sale of lead. We believe that the market for lead is established, fluid and effective; and like the markets for other natural resources, such as oil, gas, gold, silver, etc., we do not expect to encounter any issues, conditions or qualifications for the sale of our lead production at prevailing market prices set by the LME. The vertically integrated LAB manufacturers who conduct smelting operations also are buyers of lead from third parties. While these LAB manufacturers may feel threatened by our AquaRefining process, we believe that they will still purchase lead from us if we are able to offer it at the price we anticipate. Notwithstanding this, we believe that the vertically integrated LAB manufacturers account for only 50% of the demand for lead production, leaving a sizable amount of the lead market in the hands of purchasers who we believe will not be reluctant to purchase lead from us.
 
Intellectual Property Rights
 
We regard the protection of our technologies and intellectual property rights as an important element of our business operations and crucial to our success. We endeavor to generate and protect our intellectual property assets through a series of patents, trademarks, internal and external policy and procedures and contractual provisions.

1. | Patent Portfolio
---+-----------------

 
We endeavor to develop a patent portfolio that covers our key technology and also carve out additional white space with the goal of providing us with a broad scope of priority in our marketplace.
 
Set forth below is a summary of our patent portfolio:
 

· | In November 2013, we filed with the US Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) a provisional patent application covering multiple aspects of our AquaRefining process, including aspects of our proprietary water-based solvent and electrolyzer.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In November 2014, our provisional patent application was converted into an International non-provisional patent application which was filed in accordance with the Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) and contained 35 claims. The claims seek patent protection for our AquaRefining process, starting with the dissolution of the lead compounds recovered from a used LAB, the solvents used and the range of chemical compositions under which they are effective. The claims also extend to novel aspects of the electrochemical apparatus and a range of electrochemical parameters. Finally, the claims seek patent protection for the type and composition of the electrodes used, the form and quality of the lead produced and methods of removing the lead from the electrodes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In May 2015, we filed an additional international non-provisional patent application with the USPTO in accordance with the PCT which contained 39 claims. These claims seek to provide additional, complementary and alternative aspects of the November 2014 filing. The International Search Report/Written Opinion indicated that all examined claims were novel and had industrial applicability, but lacked inventive step. A response and amendment was filed addressing the alleged lack of inventive step.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In May 2015, we filed an additional six provisional patent applications with the USPTO containing a total of 54 claims. These provisional filings seek to extend our patent protection in our core process technology and seek patent coverage for areas including ancillary processes, electrolyte and water recovery, the form and uses of the lead produced and applications of our process to materials other than lead.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In May 2016, four international patent applications were filed in accordance with the PCT, having total of 250 claims, and claiming priority to the additional six provisional patent applications described above. All four international applications are currently pending.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In December of 2015, we filed an additional US non-provisional patent application. This patent filing seeks to extend our patent protection in our core process technology and seeks patent coverage for alternative process parameters in our AquaRefining process. In December 2016, we filed an additional international non-provisional patent application with the USPTO in accordance with the PCT which contained 25 claims, and which claimed priority to the US non-provisional patent application.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In January 2017, we filed a provisional patent application with the USPTO seeking to cover various aspects of electrode management, and in February 2017, a further provisional patent application was filed to cover additional aspects of continuous lead plating.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We intend to continue to prepare and file domestic and foreign non-provisional patent applications covering the claims in our provisional and non-provisional patent applications.
 
All of the above-described patent application are pending and no U.S. or foreign patents have issued to date. There can be no assurance that any patents will issue from any of our current or any future applications. Also, any patents that may issue may not survive a legal challenge to their scope, validity or enforceability, or provide significant protection for us. Competitors may work around our patents so they are not infringing. Our patent portfolio and our existing policy and procedures safeguarding our trade secrets nonetheless may face challenges so that our competitors can copy our AquaRefining process.

2. | Trademark Portfolio:
---+---------------------

 
We have filed for trademark registration in the US of the following trademarks:
 

· | AQUA METALS
--+------------


· | AQUAREFINING
--+-------------


· | AQUAREFINE
--+-----------


· | AquaRefining,” “AquaRefinery” and “AquaRefine”
--+-----------------------------------------------

 
We also intend to file foreign trademark applications for the above marks as well.
 

3. | Trade Secrets and Contract Protection
---+--------------------------------------

 
We have developed our internal policy and procedures in safeguarding our trade secrets and proprietary information. Our procedures generally require our employees, consultants and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except under specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the agreements provide that all of the technology that is conceived by the individual during the course of employment is our exclusive property. The development of our technology and many of our processes are dependent upon the knowledge, experience and skills of key scientific and technical personnel.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our operations in the United States will be subject to the Federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws applicable to the reclamation of LABs. While the lead reclamation process itself is generally not subject to Federal permitting requirements, depending on how any particular operation is structured, our facilities may have to obtain environmental permits or approvals from Federal, state or local regulators to operate, including permits or regulatory approvals related to air emissions, water discharges, waste management, and the storage of LABs on-site should that become necessary. We may face opposition from local residents or public interest groups to the installation and operation of our facilities. Failure to secure (or significant delays in securing) the necessary approvals could prevent us from pursuing some of our planned operations and adversely affect our business, financial results and growth prospects.
 
In addition to permitting requirements, our operations are subject to environmental health, safety and transportation laws and regulations that govern the management of and exposure to hazardous materials such as the lead and acids involved in LAB reclamation. These include hazard communication and other occupational safety requirements for employees, which may mandate industrial hygiene monitoring of employees for potential exposure to lead. Failure to comply with these requirements could subject our business to significant penalties (civil or criminal) and other sanctions that could adversely affect our business. Changes to these regulatory requirements in the future could also increase our costs, require changes in or cessation of certain activities, and adversely affect the business.
 
The nature of our operations involves risks, including the potential for exposure to hazardous materials such as lead, that could result in personal injury and property damage claims from third parties, including employees and neighbors, which claims could result in significant costs or other environmental liability. Our operations also pose a risk of releases of hazardous substances, such as lead or acids, into the environment, which can result in liabilities for the removal or remediation of such hazardous substances from the properties at which they have been released, liabilities which can be imposed regardless of fault, and our business could be held liable for the entire cost of cleanup even if we were only partially responsible. Like any manufacturer, we are also subject to the possibility that we may receive notices of potential liability in connection with materials that were sent to third-party recycling, treatment, and/or disposal facilities under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (“CERCLA”), and comparable state statutes, which impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault or the legality of the conduct that contributed to the contamination, and for damages to natural resources. Liability under CERCLA is retroactive, and, under certain circumstances, liability for the entire cost of a cleanup can be imposed on any responsible party.
 
As our business expands outside of the United States, our operations will be subject to the environmental, health and safety laws of the countries where we do business, including permitting and compliance requirements that address the similar risks as do the laws in the United States, as well as international legal requirements such as those applicable to the transportation of hazardous materials. Depending on the country or region, these laws could be as stringent as those in the US, or they could be less stringent or not as strictly enforced. In some countries in which we are interested in expanding our business, such as Mexico and China, the relevant environmental regulatory and enforcement frameworks are in flux and subject to change. Therefore, while compliance with these requirements will cause our business to incur costs, and failure to comply with these requirements could adversely affect our business, it is difficult to evaluate such potential costs or adverse impacts until such time as we decide to initiate operations in particular countries outside the United States.
