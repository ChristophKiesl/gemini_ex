 ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 OVERVIEW
 PREIT, a Pennsylvania business trust founded in 1960 and one of the first equity real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) in the United States, has a primary investment focus on retail shopping malls located in the eastern half of the United States, primarily in the Mid-Atlantic region.
We currently own interests in 25 retail properties, of which 24 are operating properties and one is a development property. The 24 operating properties include 20 shopping malls and four other retail properties, have a total of 19.6 million square feet and are located in eight states. We and partnerships in which we hold an interest own 15.1 million square feet at these properties (excluding space owned by anchors or third parties). There are 17 operating retail properties in our portfolio that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes. These consolidated properties have a total of 14.6 million square feet, of which we own 11.4 million square feet. The seven operating retail properties that are owned by unconsolidated partnerships with third parties have a total of 5.0 million square feet, of which 3.6 million square feet are owned by such partnerships. When we refer to “Same Store” properties, we are referring to properties that have been owned for the full periods presented and excluding properties acquired, disposed of, under redevelopment or designated as a non-core property during the periods presented. Core properties include all operating retail properties except for Exton Square Mall. Valley View Mall was previously designated as a non-core property. As discussed further in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, a foreclosure sale judgment was ordered by the court after the property operations were assumed by a receiver on behalf of the lender under the mortgage loan secured by Valley View Mall and we no longer operate the property. “Core Malls” also excludes these properties as well as power centers and Gloucester Premium Outlets.
 We have one property in our portfolio that is classified as under development; however, we do not currently have any activity occurring at this property.
 Fashion District Philadelphia opened on September 19, 2019. Fashion District Philadelphia is an aggregation of properties spanning three blocks in downtown Philadelphia that were formerly known as Gallery I, Gallery II and 907 Market Street. Joining Century 21 (which subsequently closed in 2020) and Burlington in 2019 were multiple dining and entertainment venues including Market Eats, a multi-offering food court, City Winery, AMC Theatres, and Round 1 Bowling & Amusement. In addition, Nike Factory Store, Ulta, H & M, and Primark have opened Philadelphia flagship stores at the property since its opening in September 2019. Fashion District Philadelphia is owned by our joint venture entity with our joint venture partner, the Macerich Company (“Macerich”). As of January 1, 2021, Macerich is responsible for the operations of Fashion District Philadelphia.
 We are a fully integrated, self-managed and self-administered REIT that has elected to be treated as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In general, we are required each year to distribute to our shareholders at least 90% of our net taxable income and to meet certain other requirements in order to maintain the favorable tax treatment associated with qualifying as a REIT.
 PREIT’S BUSINESS
 We are primarily engaged in the ownership, management, leasing, acquisition, redevelopment, and disposition of shopping malls. We believe our distinctive real estate is at the forefront of enabling communities to flourish through the built environment by providing opportunities to create vibrant multi-use destinations. In general, our malls include carefully curated retail and lifestyle offerings, including national and regional department stores, large format retailers and other anchors, mixed with destination dining and entertainment experiences. In recent years, we have increased the portion of our mall properties that are leased to non-traditional mall tenants, including life sciences, healthcare, supermarkets, fulfillment centers and self-storage facilities. Approximately 29.4% of our mall space is committed to non-traditional tenants offering services such as dining and entertainment, health and wellness, off-price retail and fast fashion.
 To enhance the experience for shoppers, most of our malls have restaurants and/or food courts, and some of the malls have multi-screen movie theaters and other entertainment options, either as part of the mall or on outparcels around the perimeter of the mall property. In addition, many of our malls have outparcels containing restaurants, banks or other stores. Our malls frequently serve as a central place for community, promotional and charitable events in their geographic trade areas.
 
The largest core mall in our retail portfolio is 1.4 million square feet and contains 175 stores, and the smallest core mall is 0.5 million square feet and contains 79 stores. The other properties in our retail portfolio range from 377,000 to 778,000 square feet.
 We derive the substantial majority of our revenue from rent received under leases with tenants for space at retail properties in our real estate portfolio. In general, our leases require tenants to pay minimum rent, which is a fixed amount specified in the lease, and which is often subject to scheduled increases during the term of the lease for longer term leases. In 2021, 79% of the new leases that we signed contained scheduled rent increases, and these increases, which are typically scheduled to occur between two and four times during the term, ranged from 2.0% to 10.0%, with approximately 96% ranging from 2.0% to 4.0%. In addition or in the alternative, certain tenants are required to pay percentage rent, which can be either a percentage of their sales revenue that exceeds certain levels specified in their lease agreements, or a percentage of their total sales revenue.


The majority of our leases also provide that the tenant will reimburse us for certain expenses relating to the property for common area maintenance (“CAM”), real estate taxes, utilities, insurance and other operating expenses incurred in the operation of the property subject, in some cases, to certain limitations. The proportion of the expenses for which tenants are responsible was historically related to the tenant’s pro rata share of space at the property. We have continued to shift the CAM provision in our leases to be a fixed amount, which gives greater predictability to tenants, and a majority of such revenue is derived from leases specifying fixed CAM reimbursements.
 Retail real estate industry participants sometimes classify malls based on the average sales per square foot of non-anchor mall tenants occupying spaces under 10,000 square feet in size, the population and average household income of the trade area and the geographic market, the growth rates of the population and average household income in the trade area and geographic market, and numerous other factors. Based on these factors, in general, malls that have high average sales per square foot and are in trade areas with large populations and high household incomes and/or growth rates are considered Class A malls, malls with average sales per square foot that are in the middle range of population or household income and/or growth rates are considered Class B malls, and malls with lower average sales and smaller populations and lower household incomes and/or growth rates are considered Class C malls. Although these classifications are defined differently by different market participants, in general, most of our malls would be classified as Class A or Class B properties. The classification of a mall can change, and one of the goals of our current property strategic plans and remerchandising programs is to increase the average sales per square foot of certain of our properties and correspondingly increase their rental income and cash flows, and thus potentially their class, in order to maximize the value of the property. The malls that we have sold pursuant to the strategic property disposition program we commenced in 2012 generally have been Class C properties.
 BUSINESS STRATEGY
 Our primary objective is to maximize the long-term value of the Company for our shareholders. To that end, our business goals are to obtain the highest possible rental income, tenant sales and occupancy at our properties in order to maximize our cash flows, net operating income, funds from operations, funds available for distribution to shareholders and other operating measures and results, and ultimately to maximize the values of our properties.
 To achieve this primary goal, we have developed a business strategy focused on increasing the values of our properties, and ultimately of the Company, which includes:
    •Raising capital by monetizing the embedded value in our portfolio to enhance our liquidity position and reducing debt and leverage to strengthen our balance sheet;
 •Selling off non-core properties and underperforming assets;
 •Raising the overall level of quality of our portfolio and of individual properties in our portfolio;
    •Improving the operating results of our properties; and
    •Taking steps to position the Company for future growth opportunities.
 Improving Our Balance Sheet by Reducing Debt and Leverage; Maintaining Liquidity
 Leverage. We continue to seek ways to reduce our leverage by improving our operating performance and through a variety of other means available to us. These means might include selling properties or interests in properties with values in excess of their mortgage loans and applying any excess proceeds to debt reduction; entering into joint ventures or other partnerships or arrangements involving our contribution of assets; or through other actions.
 Mortgage Loan Refinancings and Repayments. We might pursue opportunities to make favorable changes to individual mortgage loans on our properties. When we refinance such loans, we might seek a new term, better rates and excess proceeds. An aspect of our approach to debt financing is that we strive to lengthen and stagger the maturities of our debt obligations in order to better manage our future capital requirements. We might seek to repay certain mortgage loans in full in order to unencumber the associated properties, which enables us to increase our pool of unencumbered assets, have greater financial flexibility and obtain additional financing.
 Liquidity. As of December 31, 2021, our consolidated balance sheet reflected $43.9 million in cash and cash equivalents. We believe that this amount and future net cash provided by operations, together with the available credit under the First Lien Revolving Facility (as defined below and assuming continued compliance with the financial covenants thereunder) and other sources of capital, provide sufficient liquidity to meet our liquidity requirements in the short term, including for one year from the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Capital Recycling. We regularly conduct portfolio property reviews and, if appropriate, we seek to dispose of malls, other retail properties or outparcels that we do not believe meet the financial and strategic criteria we apply, given economic, market and other circumstances. Disposing of these properties can enable us to redeploy or recycle our capital to other uses, such as to repay debt, to reinvest in other real estate assets and development and redevelopment projects, and for other corporate purposes. Along these lines, in 2021 we completed the sale of three outparcels for total consideration of $14.6 million. Since we began our disposition program in 2012, we have sold 17 malls, four power centers, two street retail properties, three office properties and multiple land parcels and other real estate assets for a total of $924.3 million. The proceeds generated from these sales were reinvested in our existing redevelopment program or used to repay debt. In September 2019, we conveyed Wyoming Valley Mall to the lender of the mortgage loan secured by the property. In August 2020, we derecognized the assets of

Valley View Mall as a result of a court order assigning a receiver, however, we continue to recognize the mortgage until the property foreclosure sales process is complete. We are currently under contract to sell eight additional land outparcels and have executed an agreement of sale for a hotel site at one of our malls. We have a letter of intent for another hotel site while we are actively marketing one other site. We have executed an agreement of sale for residential sites at two of our malls and have also executed an agreement of sale for a vacant retail site at one of our malls that we expect to close in 2022.
We expect to continue to look for opportunities to sell non-core assets, including land parcels, to residential, hotel and office developers at some of our mall properties.
 Raising the Overall Level of Quality of Our Portfolio and of Individual Properties in Our Portfolio
 Portfolio Actions. We continue to refine our collection of properties to enhance the overall quality of the portfolio. We seek to have a portfolio that derives most of its Net Operating Income (“NOI”) (a non-GAAP measure; as defined below) from higher productivity properties and from properties located in major metropolitan markets. We hold ownership interests in 10 properties in the Philadelphia metro area, four properties in the Washington, D.C. metro area and one property in the Boston-Providence metro area. One method we have used and continue to use for raising the level of quality of our portfolio is disposing of assets that had certain economic features, such as sales productivity or occupancy levels below the average for our portfolio and significantly lower expected income due to anchor closures. We currently have one non-core mall (“Non-Core Malls”), Exton Square Mall, which we designated as a Non-Core Mall in 2018 because we have completed the first phase of a redevelopment with the opening of Whole Foods and the sale of a land parcel to a multifamily developer as part of our densification effort (as discussed below), and are continuing to consider the possible inclusion of other non-retail uses on the site. A second Non-Core Mall, Valley View Mall, was derecognized in the third quarter of 2020 as a result of a receiver being assigned to manage the property. A third Non-Core Mall, Wyoming Valley Mall, was conveyed to the lender of the mortgage loan secured by that property in 2019.
 Redevelopment. We might also seek to improve particular properties, to increase the potential value of properties in our portfolio, and to maintain or enhance their competitive positions by redeveloping them. We do so in order to make the properties more attractive to customers and retailers, which we expect to lead to increases in shopper traffic, sales, occupancy and rental rates. Redevelopments are generally more involved than strategic property plans or remerchandising programs and require the investment of capital. We give redevelopment priority to properties in our portfolio that are of a higher quality and where we anticipate the redevelopment can be economically transformative. Our property redevelopments focus primarily on anchor replacement and remerchandising. We believe these activities will position us to optimize our financial returns.
 Densification. We seek to maximize the value of our retail properties by adding other uses where appropriate. We believe that by incorporating residential, hotel or office uses into some of our retail properties, we will increase the value of those properties. The addition of other property types to our sites may provide synergies to both the retail and non-retail uses. The presence of residents, hotel guests or office workers in close proximity to the retail center may result in additional visits to the retail property. We have executed an agreement of sale for a hotel site at one of our malls that we expect to close in 2023. In 2020 and 2021, we entered into agreements of sale for parcels for anticipated multifamily development at eight sites on, or adjacent to, our mall properties. The closing of these transactions is subject to numerous closing conditions, including the completion of due diligence and securing of zoning variances and entitlements, which in several cases has been delayed due to, among other things, the effects of COVID-19 on business operations and availability of financing. Although we currently expect some of these transactions to close in 2022 and more to close in 2023, the closing of the transactions cannot be assured and the timing of the completion is subject to change.


Since 2014, we, along with our 50/50 joint venture partner, Macerich, have been engaged in a redevelopment of Fashion District Philadelphia (formerly The Gallery). In connection therewith, we contributed and sold real estate assets to the venture and Macerich acquired its interest in the venture and real estate from us for $106.8 million in cash. We and Macerich are jointly and severally responsible for a minimum investment in the project of $300.0 million. Fashion District Philadelphia is in a key location in central Philadelphia, strategically positioned above regional mass transit, adjacent to the convention center and tourism sites, and amidst numerous offices and residential sites. See below under ‘Financing Activity’ for a description of our loan secured by the Fashion District Philadelphia properties, which was amended in 2020. Since January 1, 2021, Macerich is responsible for the operations of Fashion District Philadelphia.
 An important aspect of any redevelopment project is its effect on the property and on the tenants and customers during the time that a redevelopment is taking place. While we might undertake a redevelopment to maximize the long term performance of the property, in the short term, the operations and performance of the property, as measured by sales, occupancy and NOI, will often be negatively affected. Tenants might be relocated or closed as space for the redevelopment is aggregated, which affects overall tenant sales and rental rates. As Fashion District Philadelphia was being redeveloped, occupancy, sales and NOI decreased from their levels prior to the commencement of the redevelopment. We expect those trends to reverse as the newly constructed space is completed, leased and occupied. On September 19, 2019, Fashion District Philadelphia, an aggregation of properties spanning three blocks in downtown Philadelphia that were formerly known as Gallery I, Gallery II and 907 Market Street, opened. Joining Century 21 (which subsequently closed in 2020) and Burlington in 2019 were multiple dining and entertainment venues including Market Eats, a multi-offering food court, City Winery, AMC Theatres, and Round 1 Bowling & Amusement. In addition, Nike Factory Store, Ulta, H & M, and Primark opened Philadelphia flagship stores at the property.
 Mall-Specific Plans. We seek to unlock value in our portfolio through a variety of targeted efforts at our properties. We believe that certain of our properties, including those in trade areas around major cities or those which are leading properties in secondary markets, can benefit from strategic remerchandising strategies, including, for example, selective re-tenanting of certain spaces in certain properties with higher quality, better-matched tenants. Based on the demographics of the trade area or the relevant competition, we believe that this subset of properties provides opportunities for meaningful value creation at the property level. We believe that we can successfully implement particular strategies at these assets by incorporating in-demand uses such as dining, entertainment and fitness, by adding discount, specialty, fast fashion and native internet retailer tenants, and by closing, relocating and right-sizing certain existing mall tenants. Some examples of in-demand tenants include Apple, Urban Outfitters and The Cheesecake Factory. We also continuously work to optimize the match between the demographics of the trade area, such as the household income level, and the nature and mix of tenants at such properties. We strive to work closely with tenants to enhance their merchandising opportunities at our properties. We believe that these approaches can attract more national and other tenants to the property and can lead to higher occupancy and NOI.
 Shopper Experiences. In addition to such property-wide remerchandising efforts, we also seek to offer unique shopper experiences at our properties by having tenants that provide products, services or interactions that are unlike other offerings in the trade area. We seek to add first-to-market tenants, dining and entertainment options, beauty and fashion purveyors, off-price retail, traditionally online retailers and health and fitness destinations such as Legoland Discovery Center, Peloton, Ulta, HomeSense, Dave & Buster's, Balsam Hill and the 1776 retail incubator, among others, as well as to provide amenities like children’s play areas and mall shopping smartphone apps.
 Vacant Anchor Replacements. In recent years, through property dispositions, proactive store recaptures, lease terminations and other activities, we have made efforts to reduce our risks associated with certain department store concentrations.
 During 2019, we re-opened or introduced additional tenants to former anchor positions at Woodland Mall in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Valley Mall in Hagerstown, Maryland and Plymouth Meeting Mall, in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania. Dick’s Sporting Goods at Valley Mall opened in the first quarter of 2020. At Plymouth Meeting Mall, we opened Michaels in the first quarter of 2020 and Shake Shack and Ideal Image in 2021. In 2017, we purchased the Macy’s location at Moorestown Mall in Moorestown, New Jersey and opened HomeSense, Sierra Trading, Five Below, and Michaels between 2018 and the first quarter of 2020. During 2021, we opened Power Warehouse at Cumberland Mall in Vineland, New Jersey.
 Construction was completed in the first quarter of 2020 giving way to the opening of Burlington in place of a former Sears at Dartmouth Mall in Dartmouth, Massachusetts. Aldi also opened in the space adjacent to Burlington in September 2021. We expect to continue to move forward with several outparcels at Dartmouth Mall resulting from the Sears recapture and to work with large format prospects for the additional space adjacent to Burlington, but have experienced delays due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 During 2019, an anchor tenant, Sears, closed at Exton Square Mall in Exton, Pennsylvania. In January 2020, the Lord & Taylor store at Moorestown Mall in Moorestown, New Jersey closed and we have leased the space to Turn 7, which opened in the fourth quarter of 2021. Sears closed its stores at Moorestown Mall in Moorestown, New Jersey and Jacksonville Mall in Jacksonville, North Carolina in April 2020. Sears continues to be financially obligated pursuant to the lease at Jacksonville Mall. In July 2021, the former Sears site at Moorestown Mall was sold to Cooper University Health Care. In May 2020, J.C. Penney filed for bankruptcy and announced the closure of its stores at the Mall at Prince Georges in Hyattsville, Maryland, and Magnolia Mall in Florence, South Carolina. The Magnolia Mall location has been leased to Tilt Studio, an entertainment concept that opened in October 2021.
 In response to anchor store closings and other trends in the retail space, we have been changing the mix of tenants at our properties. We believe our distinctive real estate is at the forefront of enabling communities to flourish through the built environment by providing opportunities to create vibrant multi-use destinations. In general, our malls include carefully curated retail and lifestyle offerings, including national and regional department stores, large format retailers and other anchors, mixed with destination dining and entertainment experiences. In recent years, we have been reducing the percentage of traditional mall tenants and increasing the share of space dedicated to non-traditional mall tenants, including life sciences, healthcare, supermarkets, fulfillment centers and self storage facilities. See “— Capital Improvements, Redevelopment and Development Projects.”


To fund the capital necessary to replace anchors and to maintain a reasonable level of leverage, we expect to use a variety of means available to us, subject to and in accordance with the terms of our credit agreements. These steps might include (i) making additional borrowings under our credit agreements (assuming availability and continued compliance with the financial covenants thereunder), (ii) obtaining construction loans on specific projects, (iii) selling properties or interests in properties with values in excess of their mortgage loans (if applicable) and applying the excess proceeds to fund capital expenditures or for debt reduction, or (iv) obtaining capital from joint ventures or other partnerships or arrangements involving our contribution of assets with institutional investors, private equity investors or other REITs.
 Improving the Operating Results of Our Properties
 We aim to improve the overall operational performance of our portfolio of properties with a multi-pronged approach.
 Occupancy. We continue to work to increase non-anchor and total occupancy in our properties, both of which have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and tenant bankruptcies. From 2020 to 2021, total occupancy for our retail portfolio including consolidated and unconsolidated properties (and including all tenants irrespective of the term of their agreement) increased 330 basis points to 90.4%, and total occupancy at our malls other than the Non-Core Malls (such other malls, the “Core Malls”) increased 290 basis points to 93.2%.
 In connection with the remerchandising plans at several of our properties, we are seeking or have obtained tenants for new spaces of different types, such as pads or kiosks. We are also seeking tenants that have not previously been prevalent at our mall properties.
 Key Tenants; Mall Leasing. We continue to recruit, and expand our relationships with, certain high profile retailers, and to initiate and expand our relationships with other quality and first-to-market retailers or concepts. We coordinate closely with tenants on new store locations in an effort to position our properties for our tenants’ latest concept or store prototype, in order to drive traffic to our malls and stimulate customer spending. We believe that increasing our occupancy in ways that are tailored to particular properties will be helpful to our leasing efforts and will help increase rental rates and tenant sales. We have also diversified the mix of tenants within our portfolio, with approximately 29% of our mall space committed to non traditional tenants offering services such as dining and entertainment, health and wellness, off price retail and fast fashion.
 Rental Rates and Releasing Spreads. Although we have been taking steps to seek positive rent spreads as we renew leases and enter into new leases, during the challenging 2021 operating environment, total renewal spreads improved 3.3% on all non-anchor leases as compared to the renewal spreads on all non-anchor leases in 2020. As discussed above, since 2012, we have sold 17 low-productivity or underperforming malls. In 2020, we derecognized the assets of Valley View Mall as the property was assigned to a receiver. We continue to recognize the mortgage until the property is sold through the foreclosure process. We believe that the disposition of these less productive assets will help improve our negotiating position with retailers with multiple stores in our portfolio (including stores at these properties), and potentially enable us to obtain higher rental rates from them at our remaining properties.
 Specialty Leasing and Partnership Marketing. Some space at our properties might be available for a shorter period of time, pending a lease with a permanent tenant or in connection with a redevelopment. We strive to manage the use of this space through our specialty leasing function, which manages the short term leasing of stores and the licensing of income-generating carts and kiosks, with the goal of maximizing the rent we receive during the period when a space is not subject to a longer term lease.
 We also seek to generate ancillary revenue (such as sponsorship marketing revenue and promotional income) from the properties in our portfolio. We believe that increased efforts in this area can enable us to increase the proportion of net operating income derived from ancillary revenue.
 Operating Expenses and CAM Reimbursements. Our strategy for improving operating results also includes efforts to control or reduce the costs of operating our properties. With respect to operating expenses, we have taken steps to manage a significant proportion of them through contracts with third party vendors for housekeeping and maintenance, security services, landscaping and trash removal. These contracts provide reasonable control, certainty and predictability. We also seek to contain certain expenses through our active programs for managing utility expense and real estate taxes. We have taken advantage of opportunities to buy electricity economically in states that have opened their energy markets to competition, and we expect to continue with this approach. We have instituted a solar energy program at five of our properties, which we expect will lower our utility expenses and reduce our carbon footprint. We also review the annual tax assessments of our properties and, when appropriate, pursue appeals.
 With respect to CAM reimbursements, we have converted most of our leases to fixed CAM reimbursement, in contrast to the traditional pro-rata CAM reimbursement. Fixed CAM reimbursement, while shifting some risk to us as landlord, offers tenants increased predictability of their costs, a decrease in the number of items to be negotiated in a lease thus speeding lease execution, and reduced need for detailed CAM billings, reconciliations and collections.
 Taking Steps to Position the Company for Future Growth Opportunities
 We are taking steps designed to position the Company to generate future growth. In connection therewith, we have implemented processes designed to ensure strong internal discipline in the use, harvesting and recycling of our capital, and these processes will be applied in

connection with proposals to redevelop properties or to reposition properties with a mix of uses, or possibly, in the future, to acquire additional properties.
 External Opportunities. Although it is not currently a primary focus, we may continue to seek to acquire, in an opportunistic, selective and disciplined manner, properties that are well-located, that are in trade areas with growing or stable demographics, that have operating metrics that are better than or equal to our existing portfolio averages, and that we believe have strong potential for increased cash flows and appreciation in value if we call upon our relationships with retailers and apply our skills in asset management and redevelopment. We also seek to acquire additional parcels or properties that are included within, or adjacent to, the properties already in our portfolio, in order to gain greater control over the merchandising and tenant mix of a property. Taking advantage of any acquisition opportunities would likely involve some use of debt or equity capital.
 We pursue development of retail and mixed use projects that we expect can meet the financial and strategic criteria we apply, given economic, market and other circumstances. We seek to leverage our skill sets in site selection, entitlement and planning, design, cost estimation and project management to develop new retail and mixed use properties. We seek properties in trade areas that we believe have sufficient demand, once developed, to generate cash flows that meet the financial thresholds we establish in the given environment. We manage all aspects of these undertakings, including market and trade area research, acquisition, preliminary development work, construction and leasing.
 Depending on the nature of the acquisition or development opportunity, we might involve a partner or sell land to a qualified third party, including in connection with projects involving a use other than retail.
 In light of the redevelopment and densification opportunities in our existing portfolio, the capital required to complete these investments, and the limitations under our credit facilities, together with a limited availability of properties that meet our investment criteria, we are not currently emphasizing external opportunities as part of our growth strategy.
 Organic Opportunities. We look for ways to maximize the value of our assets by adding a mix of uses, such as office or multi-family residential housing, initiated either by ourselves or with a partner, that are designed to attract a greater number of people to the property. Multiple constituencies, from local governments to city planners to citizen groups, have indicated a preference for in-place development, development near transportation hubs, the addition of uses to existing properties, and sustainable development, as opposed to locating, acquiring and developing new green field sites. Also, if appropriate, we will continue to seek to attract certain nontraditional tenants to these properties, including tenants using the space for purposes such as entertainment, education, health care, government and childcare, which can bring larger numbers of people to the property, as well as regional, local or nontraditional retailers. We are increasingly focused on bringing such nontraditional tenants to our properties, and we believe that such uses will increase traffic and enable us to generate additional revenue and grow the value of the property.
 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
 Financial Restructuring
 On October 7, 2020, we and certain of our wholly owned direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company Parties") entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement (the "RSA"), which contemplated agreed-upon terms for a financial restructuring of the then-existing debt and certain other obligations of the Company Parties (collectively with the following events, the "Financial Restructuring"). The RSA was amended on October 16, 2020, and again on October 23, 2020, to, among other things, extend the date by which the Company Parties were required to commence the solicitation of votes on their joint prepackaged chapter 11 plan of reorganization (the "Plan") and, thereafter, the voluntary chapter 11 cases. On November 1, 2020, we and the other Company Parties under the RSA (the "Debtors") filed our respective voluntary petitions under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code, 11 U.S.C. §§ 101-1532 (the "Bankruptcy Code") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the "Bankruptcy Court"), commencing the chapter 11 cases to confirm and consummate the Plan in order to effectuate the Debtors' financial restructuring. The Debtors' chapter 11 cases were jointly administered for procedural convenience under the caption In re Pennsylvania Real 8 state Investment Trust, el al., Case No. 20-12737 (KBO). Under the Plan, the Debtors would be recapitalized and their debt maturities extended. The Debtors continued to operate their businesses as debtors in possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. On November 30, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the "Confirmation Order"), confirming the Joint Prepackaged Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization of Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust and Certain of its Direct and Indirect Subsidiaries (with Additional Technical Modifications As of November 20, 2020) (the "Confirmed Plan"). On December 10, 2020 (the "Effective Date"), each condition precedent to consummation of the Confirmed Plan, enumerated in Section 8.2 thereof, was satisfied or waived in accordance with the Confirmed Plan and the Continuation Order, and therefore the Effective Date occurred and the Debtors emerged from bankruptcy. On the Effective Date, we entered into (a) an Amended and Restated First Lien Credit Agreement (the “First Lien Credit Agreement”) for secured loan facilities consisting of: (i) a secured first lien revolving credit facility allowing for borrowings up to $130.0 million, including a sub-facility for letters of credit to be issued thereunder in an aggregate stated amount of up to $10.0 million (collectively, the “First Lien Revolving Facility”), and (ii) a $384.5 million secured first lien term loan facility (the “First Lien Term Loan Facility”), as well as (b) a Second Lien Credit Agreement (the “Second Lien Credit Agreement” and together with the First Lien Credit Agreement, the “Credit Agreements”) for a $535.2 million secured second lien term loan facility (the “Second Lien Term Loan Facility”). The Credit Agreements replaced our previously existing secured term loan under the Credit Agreement dated as of August 11, 2020 (as amended, the “Bridge Credit Agreement”), our Seven-Year Term Loan Agreement entered into on January 8, 2014 (as amended, the “7-Year Term Loan”), and our 2018 Amended and Restated Credit

Agreement entered into on May 24, 2018 (together with the 7-Year Term Loan, the “Prepetition Unsecured Credit Agreements”). For a detailed description of the terms of our Credit Agreements, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Credit Agreements” and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.
 The final decree closing the bankruptcy case was entered by the Bankruptcy Court on March 11, 2021.
 Operating Performance
 Our net loss decreased by $130.8 million to a net loss of $135.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from a net loss of $266.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change in our 2021 results of operations was primarily due to (a) an increase in lease revenue of $34.9 million; (b) a loss on remeasurement of Fashion District Philadelphia's assets and an other than temporary impairment on our investment in Fashion District Philadelphia totaling $148.5 million, which had an unfavorable impact in 2020; (c) a decrease of $8.4 million in depreciation and amortization; (d) an increase of $6.1 million in gain on debt extinguishment; and (e) a decrease of $3.5 million in reorganization expenses incurred due to our 2020 financial restructuring; partially offset by: (a) an increase in interest expense of $43.7 million driven by higher interest rates on our Credit Agreements and higher overall debt balances; (b) impairment of assets of $9.9 million in 2021; (c) an $8.1 million non-recurring gain on derecognition of property in 2020; and (d) a decrease of $11.3 million in non-recurring gain on sales of real estate.
 Funds From Operations (“FFO”), a non-GAAP measure, increased 357.2% from the prior year, and FFO as adjusted, also a non-GAAP measure, decreased 193.3% from the prior year. Adjustments to FFO included a provision for employee separation, insurance recoveries, reorganization expenses, gain or loss on hedge ineffectiveness and a loss on debt extinguishment recognized in the fourth quarter 2020 as a result of our financial restructuring. FFO as adjusted per diluted share decreased 2% from 2020.
 Same Store net operating income (“Same Store NOI”), a non-GAAP measure, increased 27.4% over the prior year. Same Store NOI, excluding lease termination revenue, increased 26.4% compared to 2020.
 Renewal spreads at our properties decreased 6.2% on non-anchor leases under 10,000 square feet and increased 12.1% for non-anchor leases of at least 10,000 square feet.
 Retail portfolio occupancy at December 31, 2021 was 90.4%, an increase of 330 basis points compared to 2020. Non-anchor occupancy was 87.7%, an increase of 80 basis points compared to 2020. Core Mall occupancy was 93.2%, an increase of 290 basis points compared to 2020. Core Mall non-anchor occupancy was 89.5%, an increase of 10 basis points compared to 2020.
 Descriptions of each non-GAAP measure mentioned above, NOI, Same Store NOI, FFO, FFO, as adjusted, and FFO as adjusted per diluted share, as well as the related reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measures, are located in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—NON-GAAP SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL MEASURES”.
 Financing Activity
 As described above, in connection with our financial restructuring and emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases, we entered into two secured credit agreements: (a) the First Lien Credit Agreement, which includes (i) the First Lien Revolving Facility and (ii) the First Lien Term Loan Facility, and (b) the Second Lien Credit Agreement, which includes the Second Lien Term Loan Facility. The First Lien Term Loan Facility and the Second Lien Term Loan Facility are collectively referred to as the “Term Loans.” As described further above and in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements, the Credit Agreements refinanced the credit agreements that were outstanding prior to the Effective Date, pursuant to the terms of the Plan, and those credit agreements previously in effect were cancelled as of the Effective Date. As of December 31, 2020, aggregate borrowings under the Credit Agreements were as follows: (a) $54.8 million under the First Lien Revolving Facility, (b) $384.1 million under the First Lien Term Loan Facility, and (c) $538.0 million under the Second Lien Term Loan Facility. For a detailed description of the terms of our Credit Agreements, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Credit Agreements” and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.



PM Gallery LP, a Delaware limited partnership and joint venture entity owned indirectly by us and Macerich, previously entered into a $250.0 million term loan in January 2018 (as amended in July 2019 to increase the total maximum potential borrowings to $350.0 million) to fund the ongoing redevelopment of Fashion District Philadelphia and to repay capital contributions to the venture previously made by the partners. On December 10, 2020, PM Gallery LP, together with certain other subsidiaries owned indirectly by us and Macerich (including the fee and leasehold owners of the properties that are part of the Fashion District Philadelphia project), entered into an Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement (the “FDP Loan Agreement”). In connection with the execution of the FDP Loan Agreement, a $100.0 million principal payment was made (and funded indirectly by Macerich, the “Partnership Loan”) to pay down the existing loan, reducing the outstanding principal under the FDP Loan Agreement from $301.0 million to $201.0 million. The joint venture must repay the Partnership Loan plus 15% accrued interest to the Macerich lender prior to the resumption of 50/50 cash distributions to us and Macerich. In connection with the execution of the FDP Loan Agreement, the governing structure of PM Gallery LP was modified such that, effective as of January 1, 2021, Macerich is responsible for the entity’s operations and, subject to limited exceptions, controls major decisions. For a description of the terms of the FDP Loan Agreement, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Credit Agreements—FDP Loan Agreement” and Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.

Mortgage Loan Activity. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we executed forbearance and loan modification agreements for our consolidated properties Francis Scott Key Mall, Viewmont Mall, and Woodland Mall. These arrangements allowed us to defer principal payments, and in some cases interest as well. Certain of these forbearance and loan modification agreements also impose certain additional informational reporting requirements during the applicable modification periods.
    CAPITAL STRATEGY
 In support of the business strategies described above, our long-term corporate finance objective is to maximize the availability and minimize the cost of the capital we employ to fund our operations. In pursuit of this objective and for other business reasons, we seek the broadest range of funding sources (including commercial banks, institutional lenders, equity and debt investors and joint venture partners) and funding vehicles (including mortgage loans, commercial loans, sales of properties or interests in properties, and debt and equity securities) available to us on the most favorable terms. We pursue this goal by maintaining relationships with various capital sources and utilizing a variety of financing instruments, all in an effort to enhance our flexibility to execute our business strategy in different economic environments or at different points in the business cycle.
 We have two wholly-owned property mortgage loans maturing in 2022. While mortgage interest rates remain relatively low, we intend to continue to seek to extend the maturity dates of our mortgage loans to the maximum extent possible, or to replace them with longer term mortgage loans. In February 2021, we amended our Woodland Mall mortgage loan to provide for an extension option, which we exercised in December 2021, extending the maturity date to December 10, 2022.
As part of our capital strategy, in the past, we have taken steps to restructure our debt and credit facilities to align with our needs and goals at such time (including by implementing the Plan upon our emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases) and we intend to continue to evaluate our debt and credit facilities going forward. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Credit Agreements” for a detailed description of the terms of our Credit Agreements.
 In general, in determining the amount and type of debt capital to employ in our business, we consider several factors, including: general economic conditions, the capital market environment, prevailing and forecasted interest rates for various debt instruments, the cost of equity capital, property values, capitalization rates for mall properties, our financing needs for acquisition, redevelopment and development opportunities, the debt ratios of other mall REITs and publicly-traded real estate companies, and the federal tax law requirement that REITs distribute at least 90% of net taxable income, among other factors.
In the normal course of business, we are exposed to financial market risks, including interest rate risk on our interest-bearing liabilities. We attempt to limit these risks by following established risk management policies, procedures and strategies, including the use of various types of financial instruments. To manage interest rate risk and limit overall interest cost, we may employ interest rate swaps, options, forwards, caps and floors or a combination thereof depending on our underlying exposure, and subject to our ability to satisfy collateral requirements and the terms of our Credit Agreements.
Capital Availability
 To maintain our status as a REIT, we are required, under federal tax laws, to distribute to shareholders 90% of our net taxable income, which generally leaves insufficient funds to finance major initiatives internally. Because of these requirements, we ordinarily fund most of our significant capital requirements through secured and unsecured indebtedness, sales of properties or interests in properties and, when appropriate, the issuance of additional debt, equity or equity-related securities. As described above, the terms of our Credit Agreements and the existing cumulative unpaid dividends on our preferred shares create significant limitations on our ability to raise capital, including in the capital markets.
 Aggregate borrowings under our $130.0 million First Lien Revolving Facility may be limited by the debt yield covenants included in our Credit Agreements. The maximum amount that was available to be borrowed by us under our First Lien Revolving Facility as of December 31, 2021 was $75.5 million. As of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, $54.5 million was outstanding under the First Lien Revolving Facility.
In addition, our ability to finance our growth using these sources depends, in part, on our creditworthiness, the availability of credit to us, the market for our securities at the time or times we need capital and prevailing conditions in the capital and credit markets, among other things. We believe that we will have adequate access to capital to fund the remaining cost of our redevelopment program, which we currently estimate to be $4.3 million. Our continued ability to borrow under the Credit Agreements and any other indebtedness that we have or may obtain will be subject to compliance with the covenants in the Credit Agreements or in the debt agreement governing such other indebtedness. These covenants impose restrictions that limit our ability to raise capital, including by requiring us to use cash proceeds from certain capital events to prepay our debt in certain circumstances. Furthermore, as a result of the existing cumulative unpaid dividends on our preferred shares and our bankruptcy filing, we are no longer able to register the offer and sale of securities on Form S-3. This creates additional limitations on our ability to raise capital in the capital markets, potentially increasing our costs of raising capital in the future. We have been focused on improving operational efficiency and driving stable and increasing cash flows from operations while advancing our portfolio, including by undertaking, with the assistance of outside advisors, a thorough review of our business and capital structure and evaluating a wide range of opportunities to further strengthen our balance sheet and financial flexibility.
OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE
 We hold our interests in our portfolio of properties through our operating partnership, PREIT Associates, L.P. We are the sole general partner of PREIT Associates and, as of December 31, 2021, held a 98.7% controlling interest in PREIT Associates. We consolidate PREIT Associates for financial reporting purposes. We own our interests in our properties through various ownership structures, including partnerships and tenancy in common arrangements (collectively, “partnerships”). PREIT Associates’ direct or indirect economic interest in the properties ranges from 25% or 50% (for eight partnership properties) up to 100%. See “Item 2. Properties—Retail Properties.”
 We provide management, leasing and real estate development services through two of our subsidiaries: PREIT Services, LLC (“PREIT Services”), which generally develops and manages properties that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes, and PREIT-RUBIN, Inc. (“PRI”), which generally develops and manages properties that we do not consolidate for financial reporting purposes, including properties owned by partnerships in which we own an interest, and properties that are owned by third parties in which we do not have an interest. PREIT Services and PRI are consolidated. PRI is a taxable REIT subsidiary, as defined by federal tax laws, which means that it is able to offer additional services to tenants without jeopardizing our continuing qualification as a REIT under federal tax law.
 COMPETITION
 Competition in the retail real estate market is intense. We compete with other public and private retail real estate companies, including companies that own or manage malls, power centers, strip centers, lifestyle centers, factory outlet centers, theme/festival centers and community centers, as well as other commercial real estate developers and real estate owners, particularly those with properties near our properties, on the basis of several factors, including location and rent charged. We compete with these companies to attract customers to our properties, as well as to attract anchor and in-line stores and other tenants. Our malls and our other retail properties face competition from similar retail centers, including more recently developed or renovated centers that are near our retail properties. We also face competition from an increasing variety of different retail formats, including internet retailers, discount or value retailers, home shopping networks, mail order operators, catalogs, and telemarketers. Our tenants face competition from companies at the same and other properties and from other retail channels or formats as well, including internet retailers. This competition could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the amount of rent and expense reimbursements that we receive.
 The existence or development of competing retail properties and the related increased competition for tenants might, subject to the terms and conditions of our Credit Agreements, lead us to make capital improvements to properties that we would have deferred or would not have otherwise planned to make and might affect occupancy and net operating income of such properties. Any such capital improvements, undertaken individually or collectively, would involve costs and expenses that could adversely affect our results of operations.
 When we seek to make acquisitions, competitors (such as institutional investors, other REITs and other owner-operators of retail properties) might drive up the price we must pay for properties, parcels, other assets or other companies, or might themselves succeed in acquiring those properties, parcels, assets or companies. In addition, our potential acquisition targets might find our competitors to be more attractive suitors if they have greater resources, are willing to pay more, or have a more compatible operating philosophy. We might not succeed in acquiring retail

properties or development sites that we seek, or, if we pay a higher price for a property or site, or generate lower cash flow from an acquired property or site than we expect, our investment returns will be reduced, which will adversely affect the value of our securities.
 GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS
 Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances, regulations and case law, an owner, former owner or operator of real estate might be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances present at, on, under, in or released from its property, regardless of whether the owner, operator or other responsible party knew of or was at fault for the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances. Contamination might adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or lease real estate or borrow with real estate as collateral. In connection with our ownership, operation, management, development and redevelopment of properties, or any other properties we acquire in the future, we might be liable under these laws and might incur costs in responding to these liabilities.
 Each of our retail properties has been subjected to a Phase I or similar environmental audit (which involves a visual property inspection and a review of records, but not soil sampling or ground water analysis) by environmental consultants. These audits have not revealed, and we are not aware of, any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. It is possible, however, that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware.
 We are aware of certain past environmental matters at some of our properties. We have, in the past, investigated and, where we consider appropriate, performed remediation of such environmental matters, but we might be required in the future to perform testing relating to these matters or to satisfy requirements for further remediation, or we might incur liability as a result of such environmental matters. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Our Properties—We might incur costs to comply with environmental laws, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.”
 SUSTAINABILITY
 We strive to be socially and environmentally conscious. We have the capacity to produce more than 7.7 million kilowatt hours of electricity per year from solar arrays at five of our properties. The annual environmental benefit accrued through the production of renewable energy at these five properties is equivalent to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from more than 1,200 passenger vehicles. Over 85% of our centers' rooftops contain at least a portion of white roofs, which reflect sunlight and prevent heat caused roof damage and reduce summer energy usage. We have installed energy-efficient lighting at over half of our properties, which is expected to reduce our energy usage. We also currently offer 74 electric vehicle charging stations across our properties.
HUMAN CAPITAL
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 158 employees at our properties and in our corporate office.
Our key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop the highest quality talent to enhance our mission of enriching communities through the built environment. To support these objectives, our human resources programs are designed to: reward and support employees through competitive pay, benefits, and perquisite programs; enhance the Company’s culture through efforts aimed at making the workplace more engaging and inclusive; acquire and develop talent and facilitate internal talent mobility; and evolve and invest in technology, tools, and other resources for our employees.
We embrace diversity as valuable to a well-functioning company and provide equal opportunities without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, age, sexual orientation, gender/gender identity, disability, status as a protected veteran, or any other characteristic protected by applicable federal, state and local laws. We also endeavor to maintain workplaces that are free from discrimination or harassment on the basis of any such status or characteristic. In 2020, we hosted a black-owned business showcase at Woodland Mall. In 2021, we launched an initiative to support and highlight black-owned businesses throughout our portfolio.
 Our compensation program is designed to attract and retain talent. We continually assess and strive to enhance employee satisfaction and engagement, including by conducting an annual culture survey to engage employees and identify opportunities for improvement. Our employees, many of whom have a long tenure with the Company, frequently express satisfaction with management. Our employees are offered regular opportunities to participate in professional development programs, including tuition reimbursement, continuing education reimbursement, and leadership training. Our corporate headquarters office space is designed to create a better sense of place and pride and to cultivate a more collaborative work environment.
 The health and safety of our employees is a high priority, in particular during the COVID-19 pandemic. In protecting our employees’ safety, we have invested in creating safe work environments for our employees by taking additional measures such as additional work from home flexibility, increased cleaning protocols, mask wearing in our corporate office and at our properties and enhanced communication and engagement regarding Company responses to the pandemic. We also offer various wellness initiatives for our employees.
 Additionally, we are committed to sustainability and giving back to the communities in which we operate. In 2021, our properties supported several charitable organizations, hosting blood and food drives, among other community-facing initiatives. Our corporate giving program raised funds and awareness for various charitable and non-profit organizations.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic disruption, together with the preexisting economic challenges facing the retail industry, the Company implemented reductions-in-force and unpaid furloughs in 2020. In order to attempt to ease the effects of such actions, the Company extended health insurance to furloughed employees for certain periods and encouraged use of the Company’s existing wellness and mental health services through its employee assistance program. The Company has since brought furloughed employees back to full pay.
 None of our employees are unionized or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we consider our current employee relations to be good.
INSURANCE
 We have comprehensive liability, fire, flood, cyber liability, terrorism, extended coverage and rental loss insurance that we believe is adequate and consistent with the level of coverage that is standard in our industry. We cannot be assured, however, that our insurance coverage will be adequate to protect against a loss of our invested capital or anticipated profits, or that we will be able to obtain adequate coverage at a reasonable cost in the future.
STATUS AS A REIT
 We conduct our operations in a manner intended to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Generally, as a REIT, we will not be subject to federal or state income taxes on our net taxable income that we currently distribute to our shareholders. Our qualification and taxation as a REIT depend on our ability to meet various qualification tests (including dividend distribution, asset ownership and income tests) and certain share ownership requirements prescribed in the Internal Revenue Code.
CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS
 Our principal executive offices are currently located at One Commerce Square, 2005 Market Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103. In December 2018, we entered into a lease for this office space with Brandywine Realty Trust. A member of our Board of Trustees is also a trustee of Brandywine Realty Trust. The lease commenced in late December 2019 and our corporate office opened on January 2, 2020 at the One Commerce Square location.
SEASONALITY
 There is seasonality in the retail real estate industry. Retail property leases often provide for the payment of all or a portion of rent based on a percentage of a tenant’s sales revenue, or sales revenue over certain levels. Income from such rent is recorded only after the minimum sales levels have been met. The sales levels are often met in the fourth quarter, during the November and December holiday season. Also, many new and temporary leases are entered into later in the year in anticipation of the holiday season and a higher number of tenants vacate their space early in the year. As a result, our occupancy and cash flows are generally higher in the fourth quarter and lower in the first and second quarters. Our concentration in the retail sector increases our exposure to seasonality and has resulted, and is expected to continue to result, in a greater percentage of our cash flows being received in the fourth quarter.
AVAILABLE INFORMATION
 We maintain a website with the address www.preit.com. We are not including or incorporating by reference the information contained on our website into this report. We make available on our website, free of charge and as soon as practicable after filing with the SEC, copies of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K, all Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and all Current Reports on Form 8-K filed during each year, including all amendments to these reports, if any. Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports are also available on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov. In addition, copies of our corporate governance guidelines, codes of business conduct and ethics (which include the code of ethics applicable to our Chief Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer) and the governing charters for the audit, nominating and governance, and executive compensation and human resources committees of our Board of Trustees are available free of charge on our website, as well as in print to any shareholder upon request. We intend to comply with the requirements of Item 5.05 of Form 8-K regarding amendments to and waivers under the code of business conduct and ethics applicable to our Chief Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer by providing such information on our website within four days after effecting any amendment to, or granting any waiver under, that code, and we will maintain such information on our website for at least twelve months.
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND OUR PROPERTIES
 
The COVID-19 global pandemic and the public health and governmental response have adversely affected, and will likely continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, liquidity and operating results. The extent and duration of such effects are uncertain, continuously changing and difficult to predict. Additionally, the future outbreak of any other highly infectious or contagious diseases may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and operating results.
 

The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic that began in early 2020 has adversely impacted and continues to impact our operations, business, financial condition, liquidity and operating results, as well as our tenants’ businesses. The prolonged spread of COVID-19 has also led to unprecedented global economic disruption and volatility in financial markets. Some of our tenants’ financial health and business viability have been adversely impacted and their creditworthiness has deteriorated. We anticipate that our future business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, including our results for 2022 and potentially future periods, may continue to be materially impacted by the ongoing implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. Significant uncertainty remains with regard to the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its resulting impact on the economy and day-to-day life and business operations. In particular, the duration and impact of COVID-19 will depend on a variety of factors as conditions continue to fluctuate around the country, with vaccination rates, spikes in infections and restrictions on activities and recommended protocols continuing to vary and evolve. Given these factors, so long as the lingering effects of COVID-19 remain, the virus may continue to impact us or our tenants, or our ability or the ability of our tenants to resume more normal operations. Additionally, other future global health crises could result in significant effects on regional and global economies and on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.
 
While we have taken several responsive steps, potential further actions may be necessary to adapt our business and address the impacts of the pandemic, including if and to the extent business operations normalize in a manner that is different from past experience. The spread of COVID-19 and measures taken to reduce its spread subject us to a variety of risks and could result in the following impacts, many of which have already occurred and could continue and increase the longer it continues:
 •resumed property shutdowns or more onerous restrictions at any or all of our retail properties across the eight states in which we operate;
 •tenant failures to pay rent timely, resulting in revenue decreases from our properties and many requests from our tenants for rent relief or deferral and our decision to pursue litigation against several tenants;
 •our rights to enforce remedies available under our leases or ability to collect rents as a landlord may potentially be impacted by state, local or other efforts resulting in rent concessions for tenants or a delay in landlord’s ability to enforce evictions or pursue other remedies available under the leases;
 •an economic downturn generally, and a decrease in profitability for many of our tenants specifically, as a result of widespread business shutdowns or slowdowns;
 •additional tenant bankruptcies and, potentially, related store closures, including tenants that are substantial to our business in terms of size and quantity;
 •deterioration of financial markets and tightening of credit availability, leading to a potentially reduced ability to obtain financing for our tenants and us;
 •labor shortages and disruptions to supply-chain and distribution channels of our tenants, impacting retail product availability;
 •negative effects on our operations as a result of quarantines, social distancing measures, public safety concerns and limitations on the nature and scope of activities at our properties required by governmental authorities and uncertainty as to whether the current relaxation of restrictions will be maintained or whether we will voluntarily adopt restrictions and more stringent protocols, which could result in increased costs to comply with enhanced health, sanitation and social distancing measures and greater demands on our property management teams;
 •decreased operating performance from reductions in property revenue and cash flows;
 •potential reductions in the carrying value of our retail properties or other impairments of our assets;
 •our inability to meet the requirements of the covenants in our credit facilities or increases in our cost of capital that make obtaining additional capital more difficult or available only on terms less favorable to us;
 •potential negative impacts on the health of our personnel, particularly if a significant number of them are impacted, which may result in the deterioration in our ability to conduct operations to our normal standards during periods of disruption; 
 •negative effects on our liquidity position and the cost of and ability to access funds from financial institutions and capital markets;
 •delays to capital raise initiatives; and
 •creation of other risks that may impact us or exacerbation of existing risks, including the risks described in this section.
 
The significance of COVID-19 on our business will continue to depend on, among other things, the extent and duration of the pandemic, the severity of the disease and the number of people infected with the virus, and certain variants thereof, vaccination rates in regions in which our properties are located, further effects on the economy of the pandemic and of the measures taken by governmental authorities and other third parties restricting daily activities and the length of time that such measures remain in place or are renewed, implementation of governmental

programs to assist businesses and consumers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the effect of any changes to current restrictions or recommended protocols, all of which could vary by geographic region in which our properties are located. We continue to experience uncertainty as to whether government authorities will maintain the relaxation of current restrictions on businesses in the regions in which our properties are located, and whether government authorities will issue recommendations or impose requirements on landlords like us to further enhance health and safety protocols, or whether we will voluntarily adopt any of these requirements ourselves, which could result in increased operating costs and demands on our property management teams to ensure compliance with any of these requirements. While we have experienced and expect to continue to experience an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, we cannot estimate the extent to which COVID-19 will impact our future business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
 
We emerged from bankruptcy in 2020, which could adversely affect our business and relationships.
 
We emerged from bankruptcy at the end of 2020 and the final decree closing our bankruptcy case was entered by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware in March 2021. This recent bankruptcy filing and emergence from chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings could adversely affect our business and relationships with tenants, employees and other constituents. Due to uncertainties, many risks exist, including the following:
 •our ability to renew existing leases and compete for new business may be adversely affected;
 •our ability to attract, motivate and/or retain key executives and employees may be adversely affected;
 •employees may be distracted from performance of their duties or more easily attracted to other employment opportunities;
 •our ability to attract and retain tenants may be negatively impacted;
 •suppliers of our redevelopment and other projects could terminate their relationship or require financial assurances or enhanced performance; and
 •to the extent the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases constituted a cross-default under certain property-level debt facilities, ground leases, operating leases and other contractual and non-contractual obligations of our non-Debtor affiliates, such cross-defaults may have adverse effects on the affected facilities, leases and other contractual relationships.
 
The occurrence of one or more of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and reputation.
 
Store closings, leasing and construction delays, lease terminations, tenant financial difficulties and tenant bankruptcies have in the past and could in the future adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
 
We receive a substantial portion of our operating income as rent under leases with tenants. At any time, any tenant having space in one or more of our properties could experience a downturn in its business that might weaken its financial condition. There are also a number of tenants that are based outside the U.S., and these tenants are affected by economic conditions in the country where their headquarters are located and internationally. Any of such tenants might enter into or renew leases with relatively shorter terms. Such tenants might also defer or fail to make rental payments when due, delay or defer lease commencement, voluntarily vacate the premises or declare bankruptcy, which could result in the termination of the tenant’s lease, or preclude the collection of rent in connection with the space for a period of time, and could result in material losses to us and harm to our results of operations. Also, it might take time to terminate leases of underperforming or nonperforming tenants, and we might incur costs to remove such tenants. Some of our tenants occupy stores at multiple locations in our portfolio, therefore, as we have experienced in the past with tenants, the effect of any bankruptcy or store closing of those tenants might be more significant to us than the bankruptcy or store closings of other tenants. In addition, under some of our leases, our tenants pay rent based, in whole or in part, on a percentage of their sales. Accordingly, declines in these tenants’ sales, including due to factors such as tenants’ failure to innovate or change their business models at a pace sufficient to adapt to the evolving consumer landscape, could directly affect our results of operations, and in some cases allow these tenants to cancel their leases pursuant to a sales termination clause. Also, if tenants are unable to comply with the terms of our leases, or otherwise seek changes to the terms, including changes to the amount of rent, we might modify lease terms in ways that are less favorable to us.
 
If a tenant files for bankruptcy, the tenant might have the right to reject its leases, and we cannot be sure that it will assume its leases and continue to make rental payments in a timely manner. A bankruptcy filing by, or relating to, one of our tenants would bar all efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from that tenant, or from their property, unless we receive an order permitting us to do so from the bankruptcy court. In addition, we cannot evict a tenant solely because of its bankruptcy. If a lease is assumed by the tenant in bankruptcy, all pre-bankruptcy balances due under the lease must be paid to us in full. However, if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy, we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages in connection with such past-due balances in addition to the rejection damages, which amounts are likely to be less than the full amount owed to us for the rest of the lease term. If a bankrupt tenant vacates a space, it might not do so in a timely manner, and we might be unable to re-lease the vacated space during that time, at attractive rates, or at all. We may also need to incur significant expenses to re-let the space. In addition, such a scenario with one tenant could result in lease terminations or reductions in rent by other tenants of the same property whose leases have co-tenancy provisions. These other tenants might seek changes to the terms of their

leases, including changes to the amount of rent to be paid. Any unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt tenant might be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims, and there are restrictions under bankruptcy laws that limit the amount of the claim we can make if a lease is rejected. As a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In some instances, retailers that have sought protection from creditors under bankruptcy law have had difficulty in obtaining debtor-in-possession financing, which has decreased the likelihood that such retailers will emerge from bankruptcy protection and has limited their alternatives. In recent years, there has been an increased level of tenant bankruptcies and store closings by tenants that have been adversely affected by challenging economic conditions, which has been exacerbated by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations—Overview—Current Economic Conditions and Our Near Term Capital Needs” for information regarding tenants in bankruptcy. Tenant bankruptcies and liquidations have adversely affected, and are likely in the future to adversely affect, our financial condition and results of operations.
 
Changes in the retail industry, particularly among anchor tenant retailers, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
 
The income we generate depends in part on our anchor or other major tenants’ ability to attract customers to our properties and generate traffic, which affects the property’s ability to attract non-anchor tenants, and thus the revenue generated by the property. In recent years, in connection with economic conditions and other changes in the retail industry, including customers’ use of smartphones and websites, the continued expansion of e-commerce generally, and changes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken to reduce its spread, some anchor tenant retailers have experienced decreases in operating performance, and in response, they are contemplating strategic, operational and other changes. The strategic and operational changes being considered by anchor tenants include subleasing, combinations and other consolidation designed to increase scale, leverage with suppliers like landlords, and other efficiencies, which might result in the restructuring of these companies and which could involve withdrawal from certain geographic areas, such as secondary or tertiary trade areas, or the closure or sale of stores operated by them.][1] Further, our tenants may fail to innovate or change their business models at a pace sufficient to adapt to the evolving consumer landscape, which could result in an increase in store closings, tenant bankruptcies or requests for rent relief, particularly among anchor tenants. We have been affected by anchor store closings in the past and cannot assure you that there will not be additional store closings by any anchor or other tenant in the future, which could affect our results of operations and cash flows. Although we have adapted and continue to evolve our business to reduce reliance on traditional anchor department stores, closure of one or more anchor stores would have a negative effect on the affected properties, on our portfolio and on our results of operations. In addition, a lease termination by an anchor for any reason, a failure by an anchor to occupy the premises, or any other cessation of operations by an anchor could result in lease terminations or reductions in rent by other tenants of the same property whose leases permit cancellation or rent reduction (i.e., co-tenancy provisions) if an anchor’s lease is terminated or the anchor otherwise ceases occupancy or operations. In that event, we might be unable to re-lease the vacated space of the anchor or non-anchor stores in a timely manner, or at all. If a large number of anchor stores close in a particular region, competition to fill these vacancies could cause us to lease space at lower rates than we would otherwise seek, which could negatively affect our results of operations. In addition, the leases of some anchors might permit the anchor to transfer its lease, including any attendant approval rights, to another retailer. The transfer to a new anchor could cause customer traffic in the property to decrease or to be composed of different types of customers, which could reduce the income generated by that property. A transfer of a lease to a new anchor also could allow other tenants to make reduced rental payments or to terminate their leases at the property, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
 
Approximately 40% of our non-anchor leases expire in 2022 or 2023 or are in holdover status, and if we are unable to renew these leases or re-lease the space covered by these leases on equivalent terms, we might experience reduced occupancy and traffic at our properties and lower rental revenue, net operating income and cash flows.
 
The current conditions in the economy, including changes in the means and patterns of consumer behavior generally and particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, may affect employment growth and cause fluctuations and variations in retail sales, consumer confidence and consumer spending on retail goods. The weaker operating performance of certain retailers, combined in some circumstances with overleveraged retailer balance sheets in recent years has resulted in bankruptcies, store closings, consolidations of operations, and in delays or deferred decisions regarding the openings of new retail stores at some of our properties and affected renewals of both anchor and non-anchor leases. In recent years, partially because of the economic environment, we frequently renewed leases with terms of one year, two years or three years, rather than the more typical five years or ten years. These shorter term leases enabled both the tenant and us, before entering into a longer term lease, to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of a longer term lease at a later time in the economic cycle, at least in part with the expectation that there will be greater visibility into future conditions in the economy and future trends. As a result, we have a substantial number of such leases that are in holdover status or will expire in the next few years, including some leases with our top 20 tenants, and including both anchor and non-anchor leases. See “Item 2. Properties—Retail Lease Expiration Schedule” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Leasing Activity.” We might not be successful in renewing the leases for, or re-leasing, the space covered by leases that are in holdover status or that are expiring in 2022 or 2023, or obtaining positive rent renewal spreads, or even renewing the leases on terms comparable to those of the expiring leases. If we are not successful, we will be likely to experience reduced occupancy, traffic, rental revenue and net operating income, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.



We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner, and our stock price.
 
As further described in Part II, Item 9A of this report, in the course of completing our assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 (the “2021 Form 10-K”), our management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. These deficiencies related to (i) identifying and assessing risks of misstatement to ensure management review controls are designed, implemented, and operating at a level to effectively respond to those risks, (ii) monitoring the consistent operation of internal control over financial reporting and remediation of known control deficiencies, and (iii) evaluating the reliability of information used in management review controls.
 
Management developed and implemented its remediation plan during 2021, however, as further described in Part II, Item 9A of this report, the Company has not yet fully remediated its material weakness identified as of December 31, 2020, as the remediated steps were not in place for the full year 2021. Until our remediation plan is implemented for a full year and operating effectively, management will continue to devote time and attention to these efforts. Management has concluded that, because of the material weaknesses, our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2021. If our remediation plan is ineffective, there will be an increased risk that we will be unable to timely file future periodic reports with the SEC and that our future consolidated financial statements could contain errors that will be undetected. If we are unable to report our results in a timely and accurate manner, we may not be able to comply with the applicable covenants in our financing arrangements and may be required to seek amendments or waivers under these financing arrangements, which, if not agreed to, could adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition. Among other adverse consequences, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could lead to a decline in our stock price. In addition, we could be subjected to regulatory scrutiny, investigations by the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”), civil or criminal penalties or shareholder litigation, the defense of any of which could cause the diversion of management’s attention and resources. We could incur significant legal and other expenses, and we could be required to pay damages to settle such actions if any such actions were not resolved in our favor. There can be no assurance that we will not conclude in the future that the material weaknesses continue to exist or that we will not identify any significant deficiencies or other material weaknesses that will impair our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations accurately or on a timely basis.
 
The investments we have made in redeveloping older properties and developing new properties could be subject to delays or other risks and might not yield the returns we anticipate, which would harm our financial condition and operating results.
 
To the extent we continue current redevelopment projects or enter into new redevelopment or development projects in the longer term, they will be subject to a number of risks that could negatively affect our return on investment, financial condition and results of operations, including, among others:
 •higher than anticipated construction costs, including labor and material costs, the risk of which is currently elevated in the rising cost environment and due to materials shortages;
 •delayed ability or inability to reach projected occupancy, rental rates, profitability, and investment return;
 •timing delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain issues, weather, labor disruptions, zoning or other regulatory approvals, tenant decision delays, delays in anchor approvals of redevelopment plans, where required, acts of God (such as fires, significant storms, earthquakes or floods) and other factors outside our control, which might make a project less profitable or unprofitable, or delay profitability;
 •expenditure of money and time on projects that might be significantly delayed before stabilization;
 •inability to achieve financing on favorable terms, or at all;
 •failure to obtain zoning, occupancy and other governmental approvals or, to the extent required, approvals of other third parties;
 •the offer of inducements (including rent reduction, tenant allowance, and rent abatement) to tenants; and
 •the impact of co-tenancy requirements as a result of our inability to meet a projected timeline.
 
Further, any required zoning, occupancy or other government approvals or, to the extent required, other third-party approvals, may delay the sale by us of our properties or interests in our properties. Some of our retail properties were constructed or last renovated more than 10 years ago. Older, unrenovated properties tend to generate lower rent and might require significant expense for maintenance or renovations to maintain competitiveness, which, if incurred, could harm our results of operations. Subject to the terms and conditions of our Credit Agreements, as a key component of our growth strategy, we plan to continue to redevelop existing properties, and we might develop or

redevelop other projects as opportunities arise. These plans are subject to then-prevailing economic, capital market and retail industry conditions.
 
We might elect not to proceed with certain development projects after they have begun. In general, when we elect not to proceed with a project that has commenced, development costs for such a project will be expensed in the then-current period. The accelerated recognition of these expenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the period in which the expenses are recognized.
 
We might be unable to effectively manage any redevelopment and development projects involving a mix of uses, or other unique aspects, such as a project located in a city rather than a suburb, which could affect our financial condition and results of operations.
 
The complex nature of redevelopment and development projects calls for substantial management time, attention and skill. Some of our redevelopment and development projects currently, and in the future, are likely to involve mixed uses of the properties, including residential, office and other uses. We might not have all of the necessary or desirable skill sets to manage such projects. When a development or redevelopment project includes a non-retail use, we generally seek to sell the rights to that component to a third-party developer with experience in that use, or we seek to partner with such a developer. If we are not able to sell the rights to, or partner with, such a developer, or if we choose to develop the other component ourselves, we would be exposed not only to those risks typically associated with the development of commercial real estate generally, and of retail real estate, but also to specific risks associated with the development, ownership and property management of non-retail real estate, such as the demand for residential or office space of the types to be developed and the effects of general economic conditions on such property types, as opposed to the effects on retail real estate, with which we are more familiar. Also, if we pursue a redevelopment or development project with a different or unique aspect, such as a project in a dense city location like the redevelopment of [the Fashion District Philadelphia (“FDP”)], either in a partnership with another developer (like with Macerich for FDP) or ourselves, we would be, and are, exposed to the particular risks associated with the unique aspect such as, in the case of dense city projects, differences in the entitlements process, different types of responses by particular stakeholders and different involvement and priorities of local, state and federal government entities. In addition, even if we sell the rights to develop a specific component or elect to participate in the development through a partnership, we might be exposed to the risks associated with the failure of the other party to complete the development as expected. These include the risk that the other party would default on its obligations, necessitating that we complete the component ourselves (including providing any necessary financing). Additionally, in connection with our restructuring in 2020, Macerich now substantially controls the FDP joint venture’s operations and, subject to limited exceptions, controls major decisions. The lack of sufficient management resources, or of the necessary skill sets to execute our plans, or the failure of a partner in connection with a joint, mixed-use or other unique development such as FDP, could delay or prevent us from realizing our expectations with respect to any such projects and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
 
Expense reimbursements are relatively low and might continue to be relatively low. Also, operating expenses may increase in the future, reducing our cash flows.
 
Our leases have historically provided that the tenant is liable for a portion of common area maintenance (“CAM”) costs, real estate taxes and other operating expenses. If these expenses increase, then under such provisions, the tenant’s portion of such expenses also increases. Our new leases are continuing to incorporate terms providing for fixed CAM reimbursement or caps on the rate of annual increases in CAM reimbursement. In these cases, a tenant will pay a set or capped expense reimbursement amount, regardless of the actual amount of operating expenses. The tenant’s payment remains the same even if operating expenses increase, causing us to be responsible for the excess amount. To the extent that existing leases, new leases or renewals of leases do not require a pro rata contribution from tenants, and to the extent that any new fixed CAM reimbursement provision sets an amount below actual expense levels, we are liable for the cost of such expenses in excess of the portion paid by tenants, if any. This has affected and could, in the future, adversely affect our net effective rent and our results of operations. Further, if a property is not fully occupied, as it typically is not, we are required to pay the portion of the expenses allocable to the vacant space that is otherwise typically paid by tenants, which would adversely affect our results of operations.
 
Our properties are also subject to the risk of increases in CAM costs and other operating expenses, which typically include real estate taxes, energy and other utility costs, repairs, maintenance on and capital improvements to common areas, security, housekeeping, property and liability insurance and administrative costs. A significant portion of our operating expenses are managed through contracts with third-party vendors. Vendor consolidation could result in increased expense for such services. In addition, in recent years, municipalities have sought to raise real estate taxes paid by our property in their jurisdiction because of their strained budgets, our recent redevelopment of such property or for other reasons. In some cases, our mall might be the largest single taxpayer in a jurisdiction, which could make real estate tax increases significant to us. If operating expenses increase, the availability of other comparable retail space in the specific geographic markets where our properties are located might limit our ability to pass these increases through to tenants, or, if we do pass all or a part of these increases on, might lead tenants to seek retail space elsewhere, which, in either case, could adversely affect our results of operations.
 
The valuation and accounting treatment of certain long-lived assets, such as real estate, or of intangible assets, such as goodwill, could result in future asset impairments, which would be recorded as operating losses.
 
Real estate investments and related intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as a decrease in net operating income, the loss of an anchor tenant or an agreement of sale at a price below book value, indicate that the carrying amount of the property might not be recoverable. An operating property to be held and used is considered impaired under applicable accounting authority only if management’s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows to be generated by the property, undiscounted and without interest

charges, is less than the carrying value of the property. In addition, this estimate may consider a probability weighted cash flow estimation approach when alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long-lived asset are under consideration or when a range of possible values is estimated. This estimate takes into consideration factors such as expected future net operating income, trends and prospects, and upcoming lease maturities, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. We have set our estimates of future cash flows to be generated by our properties taking into account these factors, which might cause changes in our estimates in the future. If we find that the carrying value of real estate investments and related intangible assets has been impaired, as we did in recent years, we will recognize impairment with respect to such assets. Applicable accounting principles require that goodwill and certain intangible assets be tested for impairment annually or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances. If we find that the carrying value of goodwill or certain intangible assets exceeds estimated fair value, we will reduce the carrying value of the real estate investment or goodwill or intangible asset to the estimated fair value, and we will recognize impairment with respect to such investments or goodwill or intangible assets.
 
Impairment of long-lived assets is required to be recorded as a non-cash operating expense. In 2021, we recorded approximately $9.9 million in non-cash impairment charges. We did not record any noncash impairment charges on our long-lived assets in 2020. Any decline in the estimated fair values of our assets could result in impairment charges in the future. It is possible that such impairments, if required, could be material. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Asset Impairment.”
 
Conditions in the U.S. economy might adversely affect our cash flows from operations.
 
The U.S. economy has continued to experience fluctuating income growth distributed unevenly among the population, and is experiencing increased health care costs and inflation. Particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. economy experienced a downturn in economic activity in 2020 and significant supply chain and labor market disruptions into 2021 and early 2022. Changes in the patterns of consumer spending, consumer confidence and seasonal spending have led to decreased operating performance of and bankruptcy or similar filings by several retailer tenants, which has led to store closings, delays or deferred decisions regarding lease renewals and the openings of new retail stores at our properties, and has in some cases affected the ability of our current tenants to meet their obligations to us. This has affected our ability to generate cash flows, meet our debt service requirements, comply with the covenants under our Credit Agreements, make capital expenditures and make distributions to shareholders, and we expect these impacts to continue. These conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
 
Periods of economic disruption can result in volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets, and the resulting economic environment may be affected by increases in foreclosures and costs of living, all of which is likely to impact consumer spending. These circumstances could result in decreased revenues for our tenants and related decreases in the value of our properties. A sustained downward economic trend could impact our tenants’ ability to meet their lease obligations due to poor operating results, lack of liquidity or other reasons. Our ability to lease space may be impacted in this type of economic environment as could access to capital and credit markets, which may make it difficult to refinance our debt at maturity. Any of these events could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Our retail properties are concentrated in the Eastern United States, particularly in the Mid-Atlantic region, and adverse market conditions in that region might affect the ability of our tenants to make lease payments and the interest of prospective tenants to enter into leases, which might reduce the amount of revenue generated by our properties.
 
Our retail properties are concentrated in the Eastern United States, particularly in the Mid-Atlantic region, including a number of properties in the Philadelphia, and to a lesser extent, the Washington, D.C. metropolitan areas. To the extent adverse conditions affecting retail properties, such as economic conditions, population trends, changing demographics and urbanization, availability and costs of financing, construction costs, income, unemployment, declining real estate values, local real estate conditions, sales and property taxes and tax laws, and weather conditions are particularly adverse in these areas, our results of operations will be affected to a greater degree than companies that do not have concentrations in these regions. If the sales of stores operating at our properties were to decline significantly due to adverse regional conditions, the risk that our tenants, including anchors, will be unable to fulfill the terms of their leases to pay rent or will enter into bankruptcy might increase. Furthermore, such adverse regional conditions might affect the likelihood or timing of lease commitments by new tenants or lease renewals by existing tenants as such parties delay their leasing decisions in order to obtain the most current information about trends in their businesses or industries. If, as a result of prolonged adverse regional conditions, occupancy at our properties decreases or our properties do not generate sufficient revenue to meet our operating and other expenses, including debt service, our financial position, results of operations and cash flow would be adversely affected beyond the impairment charge already taken.
 
The benefits of our redevelopment of The Gallery at Market East into Fashion District Philadelphia may not be realized as expected and our financial results could be adversely affected.
 
We, along with our joint venture partner, The Macerich Company, undertook the significant redevelopment of FDP. FDP opened in 2019, but full occupancy has not yet been achieved, and stabilization is currently anticipated to be realized in 2022. Although FDP is expected to generate

a positive contribution and provide for future growth, operating FDP involves a number of risks, including those that are financial and operational in nature. For example, FDP may under-perform relative to our expectations or not perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable or it may place unanticipated demands on our resources, and in 2020, we recorded a non-cash impairment to our investment in FDP of $148.5 million. Additionally, in connection with our restructuring in 2020, Macerich now substantially controls the joint venture’s operations and, subject to limited exceptions, controls major decisions. If we are unable to realize the expected benefits of our investment in this joint venture, our financial results could be adversely affected.

We have invested and may in the future invest in partnerships with third parties to acquire, develop or redevelop properties, and we might not control the management, redevelopment or disposition of these properties, or we might be exposed to other risks.
 
We have invested and may in the future invest as a partner with third parties in the acquisition or ownership of existing properties or the development of new properties, in contrast to acquiring or owning properties or developing projects by ourselves. Entering into partnerships with third parties involves risks not present where we act alone, in that we might not have primary control over the acquisition, disposition, development, redevelopment, financing, leasing, management, budgeting and other aspects of the property or project. These limitations might adversely affect our ability to develop, redevelop or sell these properties at the most advantageous time for us, if at all. Also, there might be restrictive provisions and rights that apply to sales or transfers of interests in our partnership properties, which might require us to make decisions about buying or selling interests at a disadvantageous time.
 
Some of our retail properties are owned by partnerships for which major decisions, such as a sale, lease, refinancing, redevelopment, expansion or rehabilitation of a property, or a change of property manager, require the consent of all partners. Accordingly, because decisions must be unanimous, necessary actions might be delayed significantly and it might be difficult or even impossible to remove a partner that is serving as the property manager. We might not be able to resolve favorably any conflicts which arise with respect to such decisions, or we might be required to provide financial or other inducements to our partners to obtain a resolution. In cases where we are not the controlling partner or where we are only one of the general partners, there are many decisions that do not relate to fundamental matters that do not require our approval and that we do not control. Also, in cases in which we serve as managing general partner of the partnership that owns the property, we might have certain fiduciary responsibilities to the other partners in those partnerships.
 
Business disagreements with our third-party partners might arise. We might incur substantial expenses in resolving these disputes. Moreover, we cannot assure you that our resolution of a dispute with a third-party partner will be on terms that are favorable to us.
 
The profitability of each partnership we enter into with a third party that has short-term financing or debt requiring a balloon payment is dependent on the subsequent availability of long-term financing on satisfactory terms. If satisfactory long-term financing is not available, we might have to rely on other sources of short-term financing or equity contributions. Although these partnerships are not wholly-owned by us, if any obligations were recourse, we might be required to pay the full amount of any obligation of the partnership, or we might elect to pay all of the obligations of such a partnership to protect our equity interest in its properties and assets. This could cause us to utilize a substantial portion of our liquidity sources or operating funds and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
 
Other risks of investments in partnerships with third parties include:
 •partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions, which might inhibit our ability to make important decisions in a timely fashion or necessitate our funding their share to preserve our investment, which might be at a disadvantageous time or in a significant amount;
 •partners might undergo a change of control or a substantial change in management, which could similarly inhibit our ability to make important decisions in a timely fashion or otherwise affect our intentions with respect to a project;
 •partners might have or develop business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals;
 •partners might be in a position to take action contrary to our policies or objectives;
 •we might incur liability for the actions of our partners;
 •third-party managers might not be sensitive to publicly-traded company or REIT tax compliance matters; and
 •partners might suffer deterioration in their creditworthiness, making it difficult for the joint venture to obtain financing at favorable rates, or at all.
 
Our business could be harmed if members of our corporate management team terminate their employment with us or otherwise are unable to continue in their current capacity or we are unable to attract and retain talented employees.
 
Our future success depends, to a meaningful extent, upon the continued services of Joseph F. Coradino, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Mario C. Ventresca, Jr., our Chief Financial Officer, and the services of our corporate management team and, more broadly, our employees generally. Our executives have substantial experience in managing, developing and acquiring retail real estate. During 2021, in an effort to incentivize and retain our personnel, we extended retention bonuses to certain employees payable in installments in April and December 2022. We also entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with Joseph F. Coradino, our Chief Executive Officer, and an amendment to employment agreement with Mario C. Ventresca, Jr., our Chief Financial Officer. Each of these executives could elect to

terminate their respective agreements at any time. The loss of services of one or more members of our corporate management team, or our failure to attract and retain talented employees generally could harm our business and our prospects. Further, if we undertake certain cost-savings and restructuring initiatives in the future, they may be disruptive to our workforce and operations and adversely affect our financial results, because they may impact employee morale and may impair our ability to attract and retain talent.
 
If we suffer losses that are not covered by insurance or that are in excess of our insurance coverage limits, we could lose invested capital and anticipated profits.
 
There are some types of losses, including those of a catastrophic nature, such as losses due to wars, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, pollution, environmental matters, information technology system failures (including phishing, ransomware and cyber attacks) and lease and contract claims, that are generally uninsurable or not economically insurable, or might be subject to insurance coverage limitations, including large deductibles or co-payments or caps on coverage amounts. Under federal terrorism risk insurance legislation, the United States government provides reinsurance coverage to insurance companies following a declared terrorism event. There is a generally similar program relating to flood insurance. If either or both of these programs were no longer in effect, it might become prohibitively expensive, or impossible, to obtain insurance that covers damages or losses from those types of events. Tenants might also encounter difficulty obtaining coverage.

If one of these events occurred to, or caused the destruction of, one or more of our properties, we could lose both our invested capital and anticipated profits from that property. We also might remain obligated for any mortgage loan or other financial obligation related to the property. In addition, if we are unable to obtain insurance in the future at acceptable levels and at a reasonable cost, the possibility of losses in excess of our insurance coverage might increase and we might not be able to comply with covenants under our debt agreements, which could adversely affect our financial condition. If any of our properties were to experience a significant, uninsured loss, it could seriously disrupt our operations, delay our receipt of revenue and result in large expense to repair or rebuild the property. These types of events could adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations.
 
Inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
 
Inflation has become a growing concern. The 2021 annual rate of inflation in the U.S. is higher than at any point in recent years. Inflationary price increases could have an adverse effect on consumer spending, which could impact our tenants’ sales and, in turn, our tenants’ business operations. This could affect the amount of rent these tenants pay, including if their leases provide for percentage rent or percentage of sales rent, and their ability to pay rent. Also, inflation could cause increases in operating expenses, which could increase occupancy costs for tenants and, to the extent that we are unable to recover operating expenses from tenants, could increase operating expenses for us. In addition, if the rate of inflation exceeds the scheduled rent increases included in our leases, then our net operating income and our profitability would decrease. Inflation could also result in increases in market interest rates, which could not only negatively impact consumer spending and tenant investment decisions, but would also increase the borrowing costs associated with our existing or any future variable rate debt, to the extent such rates are not effectively hedged or fixed, or any future debt that we incur.
 
We face risks associated with, and have experienced, security breaches through cyber attacks. A significant privacy breach or IT system disruption could adversely affect our business and we might be required to increase our spending on data and system security, which could adversely affect our financial condition.
 
We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. In addition, our business relationships with our tenants and vendors involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data. Like many businesses today, we have experienced an increase in cyber-threats and attempted intrusions. Our systems are subject to a variety of forms of cyber attacks (including phishing and ransomware attacks) with the objective of gaining unauthorized access to our systems or data or disrupting our operations. Security breaches have, from time to time, occurred and may occur in the future. Due to the nature of these attacks, there is a risk that an attack or intrusion remains undetected for a period of time. Although the cyber attacks we have experienced have not had a material impact on our financial results to date, and we maintain cyber liability insurance coverage, there remains a risk that breaches in security could expose us, our tenants or our employees to a risk of loss, misappropriation of assets that cannot be recovered, or misuse of proprietary information and of sensitive or confidential data. In addition, our information technology systems, some of which are managed or hosted by third-parties, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages or hardware failures. Any of these occurrences could result in disruptions in our operations, the loss of existing or potential tenants or shoppers, damage to our brand and reputation, regulatory compliance efforts and costs, remediation costs, and litigation and potential liability. Even the most well-protected information remains potentially vulnerable, because the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber attacks and breaches of IT systems, as well as the sources of these attacks, change frequently and are often not recognized until they are launched and have been put in place for a period of time. Although we make substantial efforts to maintain the security of our networks and related systems, there can be no assurance that our security efforts will be effective or that attempted security breaches would not be successful or damaging. Our efforts include conducting periodic assessments of internal and external threats to and vulnerabilities of our information and technology systems, security controls and processes in place and the effectiveness of our management of cybersecurity risk. The results of these

assessments are used to create and implement strategies designed to prevent, detect and respond to cybersecurity threats, and we expect to continue to employ cybersecurity risk mitigation measures, as well as seek to improve and expand such measures. We expect to continue to dedicate resources to technology and mitigating related risks. We may incur increasing costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, to train employees and engage third-party experts and consultants, or to notify employees, suppliers or the general public as part of our notification obligations. The cost and operational consequences of implementing further data or system protection measures or remediation efforts could be significant. Our processes, procedures and controls to reduce these risks, our increased awareness of the risk of a cyber incident, and our insurance coverage, however, do not guarantee that our financial results would not be materially impacted by a cyber incident.
 
Our retailer tenants’ businesses also require the collection, transmission and retention of large volumes of shopper and employee data, including credit and debit card numbers and other personally identifiable information, in various information technology systems. The consequences of cyber attacks perpetrated against our retailer tenants, which may include the misappropriation of assets or sensitive information or an operational disruption, could diminish consumer confidence and spending, result in fines, legal claims or proceedings or other liability, as well as significant remediation costs, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on their financial condition and results of operations and business. This could, in turn, have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
 We might incur costs to comply with environmental laws, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
 
Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances, regulations and case law, an owner, former owner or operator of real estate might be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances present at, on, under, in or released from its property, regardless of whether the owner, operator or other responsible party knew of or was at fault for the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances. The responsible party also might be liable to the government or to third parties for substantial property damage and investigation and cleanup costs. Even if more than one person might have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws might be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs incurred. In addition, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs the government incurs in connection with the contamination. Contamination might adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or lease real estate or borrow with that real estate as collateral. In connection with our ownership, operation, management, development and redevelopment of properties, or any other properties we acquire in the future, we might be liable under these laws and might incur costs in responding to these liabilities.
 
We are aware of certain environmental matters at some of our properties. We have, in the past, investigated and, where appropriate, performed remediation of such environmental matters, but we might be required in the future to perform testing relating to these matters and further remediation might be required, or we might incur liability as a result of such environmental matters. Environmental matters at our properties include the following:
 
Asbestos. Asbestos-containing materials are present at a number of our properties, primarily in the form of floor tiles, mastics, roofing materials and adhesives. Fire-proofing material containing asbestos is present at some of our properties in limited concentrations or in limited areas. Under applicable laws and practices, asbestos-containing material in good, non-friable condition are allowed to be present, although removal might be required in certain circumstances. In particular, in the course of any redevelopment, renovation, construction or build out of tenant space, asbestos-containing materials are generally removed.
 
Underground and Above Ground Storage Tanks. Underground and above ground storage tanks are or were present at some of our properties. These tanks were used to store waste oils or other petroleum products primarily related to the operation of automobile service center establishments at those properties. In some cases, the underground storage tanks have been abandoned in place, filled in with inert materials or removed and replaced with above ground tanks. Some of these tanks might have leaked into the soil, leading to ground water and soil contamination. Where leakage has occurred, we might incur investigation, remediation and monitoring costs if responsible current or former tenants, or other responsible parties, are unavailable to pay such costs.
 
Ground Water and Soil Contamination. Ground water contamination has been found at some properties in which we currently or formerly had an interest. At some properties, dry cleaning operations, which might have used solvents, contributed to ground water and soil contamination.
 Each of our retail properties has been subjected to a Phase I or similar environmental audit (which involves a visual property inspection and a review of records, but not soil sampling or ground water analysis) by environmental consultants. These audits have not revealed, and we are not aware of, any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. It is possible, however, that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware. Also, we cannot assure you that future laws will not impose any material environmental liability, or that the current environmental condition of our properties will not be affected by the operations of our tenants, by the existing condition of the land, by operations in the vicinity of the properties (such as the presence of underground storage tanks) or by the activities of unrelated third parties.
 
We have environmental liability insurance coverage for the types of environmental liabilities described above, which currently covers liability for pollution and on-site remediation of up to $10.0 million per occurrence and $10.0 million in the aggregate over our two-year policy term.

We cannot assure you that this coverage will be adequate to cover future environmental liabilities. If this environmental coverage were inadequate, we would be obligated to fund those liabilities. We might be unable to continue to obtain insurance for environmental matters, at a reasonable cost or at all, in the future.
 
In addition to the costs of remediation, we might incur additional costs to comply with federal, state and local laws relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. There are also various federal, state and local fire, health, life-safety and similar regulations that might be applicable to our operations and that might subject us to liability in the form of fines or damages for noncompliance. The cost described above, individually or in the aggregate, could adversely affect our results of operations.
 
We face possible risks associated with climate change.
 
There is increasing evidence of global warming and, more generally, climate change as extreme weather events and associated damage is being experienced with increasing frequency and severity. To the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns, our properties in certain markets and regions could be impacted by increases in storm intensity and rising sea levels, any of which may cause damage and result in costly repairs or renovations to adapt our properties, and/or require extended closures of our properties. Over time, these conditions could result in volatile or decreased demand for retail space at certain of our properties or, in extreme cases, our inability to operate the properties at all. Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) insurance on favorable terms and increasing the cost of energy and snow removal at our properties. Moreover, compliance with new laws or regulations related to climate change, including compliance with “green” building codes, may require us to make improvements to our existing properties or increase taxes and fees assessed on us or our properties. At this time, there can be no assurance that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on us.
 
We might not be successful in identifying suitable acquisitions, completing acquisitions, or integrating any properties we acquire, which might adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
 
Acquisitions of retail properties were historically an important component of our growth strategy, although we have not completed any acquisitions in recent years and do not currently anticipate acquisition activity in the near term. Expanding by acquisitions requires us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet the criteria we apply, given economic, market or other circumstances, and that are compatible with our growth strategy. Our credit facilities substantially limit our right to pursue acquisitions, subject to certain exceptions. We might not be successful in identifying suitable properties or other assets in our existing geographic markets or in markets new to us that meet the acquisition criteria we apply, given economic, market or other circumstances, in financing such properties or other assets or in consummating acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms or we may not be able to compete effectively. Further, time constraints or other limitations in the scope of our diligence review might lead us to make acquisitions that might have additional or larger issues than we anticipated, which might reduce the returns on our investment and affect our financial condition and results of operations.

To the extent that we pursue and complete acquisitions of additional properties or portfolios of properties that meet the investment criteria we apply, given economic, market and other circumstances, we might not be able to adapt our management and operational systems to effectively manage any such acquired properties or portfolios, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
 RISKS RELATED TO THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY
 
Online shopping and other uses of technology could affect the business models and viability of retailers, which could, in turn, affect their demand for retail real estate.
 
Online retailing and shopping and the use of technology to aid purchase decisions have increased in recent years, and particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the shift to online shopping has been accelerated and significant. These changes to retail models are expected to continue to remain popular in the future. In certain categories, such as books, music, apparel and electronics, online retailing has become a significant proportion of total sales, and has affected retailers and consumers significantly. The information available online empowers consumers with knowledge about products and information about prices and other offers differently than information available in a single physical store with sales associates. Consumers are able to purchase products anytime and anywhere and are able to compare more products than are typically found in a single retail location, and they are able to read product reviews and to compare product features and pricing. In addition, customers of certain of our retailers use technology including smartphones to check competitors’ product offerings and prices while in stores evaluating merchandise. Some tenants utilize our shopping centers as showrooms or as part of an omni-channel strategy (allowing for customers to shop online or in stores and for order fulfillment and returns to take place in stores or via shipping). In this model, customers may make purchases during or immediately after visiting our malls, with such sales not currently being captured in our tenant sales figures or monetized in our minimum or percentage rents.
 

Online shopping and technology, such as smartphone applications, are affecting and might continue to affect the business models, sales and profitability of retailers, which would, in turn, affect the demand for retail real estate, occupancy at our properties and the amount of rent that we receive. Any resulting decreases in rental revenue could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
 
We are subject to risks that affect the retail real estate environment generally.
 
Our business focuses on retail real estate, predominantly malls. As such, we are subject to certain risks that can affect the ability of our retail properties to generate sufficient revenue to meet our operating and other expenses, including debt service, to make capital expenditures and to make future distributions to our shareholders. We face continuing challenges because of changing consumer preferences and because the conditions in the economy affect employment growth and cause fluctuations and variations in retail sales and in business and consumer confidence and consumer spending on retail goods. Although we have adapted our properties to rely less on traditional retail and include more community-centric mixed-uses, we remain subject to a number of factors that can negatively affect the income generated by a retail property or the value of a property, including: a downturn in the national, regional or local economy; a decrease in employment or consumer confidence or spending; increases in operating costs, such as CAM, real estate taxes, utility rates and insurance premiums; higher energy or fuel costs resulting from adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, geopolitical concerns, terrorist activities and other factors; changes in interest rate levels and the cost and availability of financing; a weakening of local real estate conditions, such as an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, retail space or retail goods, and the availability and creditworthiness of current and prospective tenants; trends in the retail industry; seasonality; changes in perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of a retail property; perceived changes in the convenience and quality of competing retail properties and other retailing options such as internet shopping or other strategies, such as using smartphones or other technologies to determine where to make and to assist in making purchases; tenants’ ability to innovate or change their business models at a pace sufficient to adapt to the evolving consumer landscape; the ability of our tenants to meet shoppers’ demands for quality, variety, and product availability, which may be impacted by supply chain disruptions; and changes in laws and regulations applicable to real property, including tax and zoning laws. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in travel restrictions and plant shutdowns, which impacted our tenants’ supply chains and, ultimately, retail product availability. Even as quarantine and other business restrictions have been relaxed, ongoing supply chain and labor force challenges have impacted product availability and ability to operate at full capacity. Continuing fears related to the continually evolving COVID-19 pandemic could impact shoppers’ willingness to visit our retail properties and the continued spread of the virus and emergence of numerous variants has led to operational changes in our mall environments to allow for social distancing and to provide enhanced health and safety measures. The extent and duration of the pandemic and its impact on our tenants and our operations is uncertain, but the longer the pandemic continues, the greater the risk is that its effects and various measures taken in response could continue to adversely affect us.

Changes in one or more of the aforementioned factors can lead to a decrease in the revenue or income generated by our properties and can have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Many of these factors could also specifically or disproportionately affect one or more of our tenants, which could lead to decreased operating performance, reduce property revenue and affect our results of operations. If the estimated future cash flows related to a particular property are significantly reduced, we may be required to reduce the carrying value of the property.
 
The retail real estate industry is highly competitive, and this competition could harm our ability to operate profitably.
 
Competition in the retail real estate market is intense. We compete with other public and private retail real estate companies, including companies that own or manage malls, power centers, strip centers, lifestyle centers, factory outlet centers, theme/festival centers and community centers, as well as other commercial real estate developers and real estate owners, particularly those with properties near our properties, on the basis of several factors, including location and rent charged. We compete with these companies to attract customers to our properties, as well as to attract anchor and non-anchor store and other tenants. Our malls and our other operating properties face competition from similar retail, destination dining and entertainment centers, including more recently developed or renovated centers that are near our retail properties. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources or have different investment criteria than we do, a competitive factor that could become even more relevant as competitors gain size and economies of scale as a result of merger and consolidation activity. We also face competition from a variety of different retail formats, including internet retailers, discount or value retailers, home shopping networks, mail order operators, catalogs, and telemarketers. Our tenants face competition from companies at the same and other properties and from other retail formats as well, including internet retailers. Further, the increased use of online retail shopping may lead to the closure of underperforming stores by retailers, which could impact our occupancy levels and the rates that tenants are willing to pay to lease our space. They also face competition for employees in the current highly constrained labor market, which could impact their operations and operating costs. This competition could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the amount of rent and expense reimbursements that we receive.
 
The existence or development of competing retail properties and the related increased competition for tenants might, subject to the terms and conditions of our Credit Agreements, require us to make capital improvements to properties that we would have deferred or would not have otherwise planned to make, and might also affect the total sales, occupancy and net operating income of such properties. Any such capital

improvements, undertaken individually or collectively, would involve costs and expenses that could adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, such costs and expenses could lead to greater earnings volatility than would be experienced by our larger competitors.
 Acts of violence or war or other terrorist activity, including at our properties, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
 Violent activities, terrorist or other attacks, threats of attacks or the increased frequency of such attacks or threats of attacks could directly affect the value of our properties as a result of casualties or through property damage, destruction or loss, or by making shoppers afraid to patronize such properties. The availability of insurance for such acts, or of insurance generally, might decrease, or cost more, which could increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Future acts of violence or terrorist attacks in the United States might result in declining economic activity, which could harm the demand for goods and services offered by our tenants and the value of our properties, and might adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. Such a decrease in retail demand could make it difficult for us to renew leases or enter into new leases at our properties at lease rates equal to or above historical rates. To the extent that our tenants are directly or indirectly affected by future attacks, their businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to meet obligations under their existing leases. Customers of the tenants at an affected property, and at other properties, might be less inclined to shop at an affected location or at a retail property generally. Such acts might erode business and consumer confidence and spending, and might result in increased volatility in national and international financial markets and economies. Any such acts could decrease demand for retail goods or real estate, decrease or delay the occupancy of our properties, and limit our access to capital or increase our cost of raising capital.
 Social unrest and acts of vandalism or violence could adversely affect our business operations.
 Our business may be adversely affected by social, political, and economic instability, unrest, or disruption, including protests, demonstrations, strikes, riots, civil disturbance, disobedience, insurrection and looting in geographic regions where our properties are located. Such events may result in property damage and destruction and in restrictions, curfews, or other governmental actions that could give rise to significant changes in economic conditions and cycles, which may adversely affect our financial condition and operations.
 In 2020 and 2021, there have been demonstrations and protests, some of which involved violence, looting, arson and property destruction, in cities throughout the United States. While the majority of protests have been peaceful, looting, vandalism and fires have taken place in certain places, which led to the imposition of mandatory curfews and, in some locations, deployment of the National Guard. Governmental actions taken to protect people and property, including curfews and restrictions on business operations, may disrupt operations, harm perceptions of personal well-being and increase the need for additional expenditures on security resources. The effect and frequency of the demonstrations, protests or other factors is uncertain, and we cannot assure there will not be further political or in the future or that there will not be other events that could lead to further social, political and economic instability. If such events or disruptions persist for a prolonged period of time, our overall business and results of operations may be adversely affected.
 The illiquidity of real estate investments might delay or prevent us from selling properties that we determine no longer meet the strategic and financial criteria we apply and could significantly affect our ability to respond in a timely manner to adverse changes in the performance of our properties and harm our financial condition.
 
Substantially all of our assets consist of investments in real properties. We review all of the assets in our portfolio regularly and we make determinations about which assets have growth potential and which properties do not meet the strategic or financial criteria we apply and should thus be divested. Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to quickly sell one or more properties in our portfolio in response to our evaluation or to changing economic and financial conditions is limited. The real estate market is affected by many factors that are beyond our control, such as general economic conditions, the availability of financing, interest rates, and the supply and demand for space. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. The number of prospective buyers interested in purchasing malls is limited. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. In addition, prospective buyers might experience increased costs of debt financing or other difficulties in obtaining debt financing (as the volatility in the credit markets may be reflected in lending on unfavorable terms to the retail industry), which might make it more difficult for us to sell properties or might adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell. In the recent past, we have sold various properties, including land parcels for development, and entered into agreements to sell others, and the sale process has taken an extended period, often subject to delays, in order to complete diligence and secure entitlements. Further, we have entered into agreements to sell properties that were delayed and then terminated because the purchaser was unable to raise sufficient financing for closing. There are also limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to REITs that could limit our ability to sell assets. In addition, because our properties are mortgaged to secure our debts, we may not be able to secure a release of a lien on a mortgaged property without payment of the associated debt and/or a substantial prepayment penalty, or transfer of a debt to a buyer, which restricts our ability to dispose of property, even though the sale might otherwise be desirable. Therefore, if we want to sell one or more of our properties, we might not be able to make such dispositions in the desired time period, or at all, and might

receive less consideration than we seek or than we originally invested in the property. Additionally, the terms of our Credit Agreements require us to apply a portion of the net cash proceeds of asset dispositions as prepayments under the Credit Agreements.

Before a property can be sold, we might be required to make expenditures to correct defects or to make improvements. We cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements, and if we cannot do so, we might not be able to sell the property, or might be required to sell the property on unfavorable terms. In acquiring a property, we might agree with the sellers or others to provisions that materially restrict us from selling that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions, such as limitations on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property. These factors and any others that would impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties could significantly harm our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, failure to sell the properties that we intend to sell could delay or negatively affect our strategy to obtain higher rental rates from retailers with multiple stores in our portfolios, including at these properties.
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS AND OUR FINANCING
 
We have substantial debt and preferred shares outstanding with substantial liquidation preference, which could adversely affect our overall financial health and our operating flexibility. We require significant cash flows to satisfy our debt service. These obligations may prevent us from using our cash flows for other purposes. If we are unable to satisfy these obligations, we might default on our debt and our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.
 
We use a substantial amount of debt and preferred shares outstanding to finance our business, including through indebtedness secured by mortgages and deeds of trust on our properties. As of December 31, 2021, we had an aggregate consolidated indebtedness of $1,872.7 million, substantially all of which is secured by our assets, including mortgages on our properties. These aggregate debt amounts do not include our proportionate share of indebtedness of our partnership properties, which was $381.0 million as of December 31, 2021. We also had outstanding as of December 31, 2021, in the aggregate, $95.8 million of 7.375% Series B Preferred Shares, $191.1 million of 7.20% Series C Preferred Shares and $137.9 million of 6.875% Series D Preferred Shares.
 
Our substantial indebtedness involves significant obligations for the payment of interest and principal. Our first and second lien Credit Agreements mature and come due in December 2022, subject to a one-year extension to December 2023 at our option, subject to minimum liquidity of $35.0 million, a minimum corporate debt yield of 8.0%, a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 105% as determined by an appraisal and no default or event of default existing. If we are unable to meet the conditions to extend the maturity date of our Credit Agreements, or if we do not have sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our payment obligations, we might be forced to sell assets to generate cash, which might be on unfavorable terms, if at all, or we might not be able to make all required payments of principal and interest on our debt, which could result in a default or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We are not currently paying dividends on our preferred shares due to, among other things, restrictions in our credit facilities. As a result, unpaid dividends are accruing and increasing the liquidation amount of our preferred shares. Because we have not paid dividends on the preferred shares for six quarters, the holders of the outstanding preferred shares, voting together as a single class, have the right to elect two additional trustees to our Board. On February 23, 2022, we received a notice from a holder of the outstanding preferred proposing to nominate two individuals to be elected to serve as two additional trustees to our Board at our upcoming 2022 annual meeting. As of December 31, 2021, the cumulative amount of unpaid dividends on the outstanding preferred shares totaled approximately $41.1 million. See “—We could face adverse consequences as a result of the actions of activist shareholders” for a description of risks related to the election of trustees by holders of our preferred shares.
 
Our substantial obligations arising from our indebtedness could also have other negative consequences to our shareholders, including the acceleration of a significant amount of our debt if we are not in compliance with the terms of such debt or, if such debt contains cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions (as our Credit Agreements do), other debt. If we fail to meet our obligations under our debt, we could lose assets due to foreclosure or sale on unfavorable terms, which could create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds, or such failure could harm our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions, redevelopment and development activities, execution of our business strategy or other general corporate purposes. Also, our indebtedness and mandated debt service might limit our ability to refinance existing debt or to do so at a reasonable cost, might make us more vulnerable to adverse economic and market conditions, might limit our ability to respond to competition or to take advantage of opportunities, and might discourage business partners from working with us or counterparties from entering into hedging transactions with us.
 
Furthermore, since a significant percentage of our assets are used to secure our debt, this reduces the amount of collateral available for future secured debt or credit support and reduces our flexibility in operating these secured assets. This relatively high level of debt and related security could also limit our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other purposes and could limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to service debt.

In addition to our current debt, we might incur additional debt in the future in the form of mortgage loans, unsecured borrowings, additional borrowing under our existing Credit Agreements, other term loan borrowings or other financing vehicles or arrangements. We might do so in order to finance development or redevelopment of properties, acquisitions or for other general corporate purposes, subject to the terms and conditions of our Credit Agreements, which could exacerbate the risks described above. These consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


The covenants in our Credit Agreements limit our ability to take certain actions, which could adversely affect our business and our ability to raise capital.
 The terms of our Credit Agreements place restrictions on, among other things, our ability to make certain restricted payments (including distributions to shareholders, subject to limited exceptions including to preserve REIT status), make certain types of investments and acquisitions, issue redeemable securities (subject to exceptions for shares that are redeemable solely in exchange for common shares or other equivalents), incur additional indebtedness, incur liens on our assets, enter into agreements with a negative pledge, make certain intercompany transfers, merge, consolidate, or sell our assets or the equity interests of our subsidiaries, amend our organizational documents or material contracts, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, or enter into derivatives contracts. These restrictions could limit our ability to respond to changes and competition and reduce our flexibility in conducting our operations, including by restricting our ability to manage our cash flows, pursue acquisitions and redevelopment and development projects, and raise capital through securities offerings. The terms of our Credit Agreements also restrict us, subject to certain exceptions, from entering into certain major leases, assigning leases, discounting rent under certain leases, collecting rent in advance, terminating or modifying certain leases, consenting to tenants’ assignment or subletting of certain leases, or subordinating leases.
Additionally, if we receive net cash proceeds from certain capital events (including equity issuances), we are required to prepay loans under our Credit Agreements. In addition, the Credit Agreements contain, and any future debt agreements may contain, cross-default provisions that trigger an event of default if we fail to make certain payments or otherwise fail to comply with our obligations with respect to certain of our other indebtedness. Our continued ability to borrow under the Credit Agreements and any other indebtedness that we have or may obtain will be subject to compliance with the covenants in the Credit Agreements or in the debt agreement governing such other indebtedness.
Furthermore, as a result of the existing cumulative unpaid dividends on our preferred shares and our bankruptcy filing, we are no longer able to register the offer and sale of securities on Form S-3. This creates limitations on our ability to raise capital in the capital markets, potentially increasing our costs of raising capital in the future.
 The restrictions on our business imposed by the terms of our Credit Agreements could adversely affect our business generally in addition to our ability to raise capital and our results of operations, cash flow and ability to make capital expenditures in the future.
 If we are unable to comply with the covenants in our Credit Agreements, we might be adversely affected.
 
As discussed in “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Identical covenants and common provisions contained in the Credit Agreements,” on December 10, 2020, we entered into agreements for secured credit facilities as part of our restructuring efforts upon emergence from bankruptcy and in accordance with the Plan. Our Credit Agreements require us to satisfy certain affirmative and negative covenants (including maintaining minimum liquidity of $25 million) and to meet certain financial tests, including tests relating to our corporate debt yield and senior debt yield. As of December 31, 2021, the maximum amount that was available to be borrowed by us under the First Lien Revolving Facility was $75.5 million, which is not reduced by any usage of the borrowing capacity to fulfill our unrestricted cash liquidity requirement of $25 million as described further in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.
 
As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all the financial covenants in our Credit Agreements, however, a material decline in future operating results could affect our ability to comply with these covenants. Particularly in light of recent property sales, reduction in our asset base and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, we are at increased risk of being unable to comply with these covenants or having reduced borrowing capacity in the future. We expect the current conditions in the economy and the retail industry, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting unprecedented global economic disruption (including disruptions to our and our tenants’ businesses and operations), to continue to materially affect our operating results. Furthermore, to determine our compliance with the Credit Agreements, including the covenants, we must apply our judgment to our facts, taking into account our past practice, and interpret the contractual provisions in the agreements. To the extent that our lenders interpret these differently than us, we may have disagreements or disputes, and if we are unable to resolve them, these disagreements may result in material limitations on our ability to access funding under the facility, protracted negotiations, and/or legal proceedings.

We regularly engage in discussions with lenders that participate in our credit facilities regarding our capital and liquidity resources and needs, including, as appropriate, to explore alternatives and ensure that we will remain in compliance with our financial covenants and have continued access to funding under the facilities, which alternatives may include waivers or amendments. There is no assurance that we could obtain such agreements, waivers or amendments, and even if obtained, we would likely incur additional costs. Our inability to comply with the terms of our credit agreements or to obtain any such agreement, waiver or amendment could result in a breach and a possible event of default under our Credit Agreements, which could allow the lenders to discontinue lending or issuing letters of credit, terminate any commitments they have made to provide us with additional funds, declare amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable, and/or take possession of the property or properties securing such debt. If a default were to occur, we might have to refinance the debt through secured or unsecured debt financing or private or public offerings of debt or equity securities. If we are unable to do so, we might have to liquidate assets, potentially on unfavorable terms. No assurance can be provided that we would be able to liquidate assets in a timely fashion or in satisfaction of our obligations.


Any of the factors described above could negatively affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flow and ability to make capital expenditures in the future.
 We have determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
 
In evaluating whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued, our management considered our current financial condition and liquidity sources, including current funds available, forecasted future cash flows and our conditional and unconditional obligations due over the next twelve months. Management specifically considered the FDP Loan Agreement, which includes a quarterly debt yield covenant and a loan balance of $194.6 million as of December 31, 2021 with a maturity date of January 2023 (unless extended by one year upon the borrowers’ satisfaction of certain conditions), and for which PREIT Associates, L.P. has guaranteed 50% of the borrowers’ obligations thereunder. As a result of the considerations articulated below, management concluded there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.
 
The FDP Loan Agreement has a balance of $194.6 million at December 31, 2021, maturing January 2023, with an option to extend maturity to January 2024. This agreement also contains a 10% quarterly debt yield covenant beginning on December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the FDP joint venture entity borrower, PM Gallery L.P., did not meet the minimum 10% debt yield covenant, which triggered the lender to sweep cash from the property. This is not an event of default. As of June 30, 2022, the debt yield covenant threshold is 9%, subsequent to which the joint venture would be required to pay down the term loan to achieve a 9% debt yield. Based on the joint venture’s current forecast, management projects that the joint venture will not be able to meet this covenant as the debt yield is projected to be under 9%. To the extent the term loan is not paid down by the joint venture, this term loan could become due and payable during the second half of 2022. The Company guarantees 50% of the joint venture’s obligations under the FDP Loan Agreement and management projects that the Company would not be able to satisfy its obligations if the FDP term loan would become due and payable in 2022. The Company plans to work with its joint venture partner to satisfy any obligations coming due under the FDP Loan Agreement should it become due and payable as a result of the joint venture not meeting the debt yield covenant. If, however, the administrative agent makes a demand of payment under our guarantee, there are circumstances, including the commencement of court proceedings under that guarantee, under which the default under the FDP Loan Agreement could give rise to an event of default under our Credit Agreements, which would permit our lenders to exercise remedies including to accelerate the payment obligations thereunder.
 
Although we plan to work with our joint venture partner to obtain the financial support necessary to satisfy any obligations coming due under the FDP Loan Agreement should it become due and payable as a result of not meeting the debt yield covenant, there are inherent risks, unknown results and significant uncertainties associated with this matter and a direct correlation to our ability to satisfy our financial obligations that may arise over the applicable twelve month period. Our ability to obtain relief from the FDP Loan Agreement lender involves performance by third parties and therefore cannot be considered probable of occurring.
 
The consolidated financial statements included in this report have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. Management is taking steps to mitigate the associated risks, but we can provide no assurance that cash generated from our operations together with cash received in the future from our various sources of funding will be sufficient to enable us to continue as a going concern.
 Secured indebtedness exposes us to the possibility of foreclosure, which could result in the loss of our investment in certain of our subsidiaries or in a property or group of properties or other assets subject to indebtedness.
 We have granted our lenders security interests in a portfolio of our assets, including equity interests in certain of our subsidiaries and in certain of our real property. Incurring secured indebtedness, including mortgage indebtedness, increases our risk of asset and property losses because defaults on indebtedness secured by our assets, including equity interests in certain of our subsidiaries and in certain of our real property, may result in foreclosure actions initiated by lenders and ultimately our loss of the property or other assets securing any loans for which we are in default.
 Any foreclosure on a mortgaged property or group of properties could have a material adverse effect on the overall value of our portfolio of properties and more generally on our business. For tax purposes, a foreclosure of any of our properties would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the indebtedness secured by the mortgage. If the outstanding balance of the indebtedness secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property, we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure, but would not

receive any cash proceeds, which could materially and adversely affect us. As a result, our substantial secured indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 We might not be able to refinance our existing obligations or obtain the capital required to finance our activities.
 The REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, generally require the distribution to shareholders of 90% of a REIT’s net taxable income, excluding net capital gains, which generally leaves insufficient funds to finance major initiatives internally. Due to these requirements, and subject to the terms of the Credit Agreements, we generally fund certain capital requirements, such as the capital for renovations, expansions, redevelopments, other non-recurring capital improvements, scheduled debt maturities, and acquisitions of properties or other assets, through secured and unsecured indebtedness and, when available and market conditions are favorable, the issuance of additional equity securities.
 
As of December 31, 2021, our mortgage loans are secured by nine of our consolidated properties and are due in installments over various terms extending to the year 2025. Also, we estimate that we will need $4.3 million of additional capital to complete our current redevelopment projects, including the completion of redevelopment at FDP, which opened on September 19, 2019. Our ability to finance growth from financing sources depends, in part, on our creditworthiness, the availability of credit to us from financing sources, or the market for our debt, equity or equity-related securities when we need capital, and on conditions in the capital markets generally. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” for information about our available sources of funds. There can be no assurances that we will continue to be able to obtain the financing we need for future growth or to meet our debt service as obligations mature, or that the financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. A lack of acceptable financing could delay or hinder our growth initiatives, or prevent us from implementing our initiatives on satisfactory terms.
 If our mortgage loans and other debts cannot be repaid in full, refinanced or extended at maturity on acceptable terms, or at all, a lender could foreclose upon the mortgaged property and receive an assignment of rent and leases or pursue other remedies, or we might be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties on unfavorable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and which might adversely affect our cash flow.
 Payments by our direct and indirect subsidiaries of dividends and distributions to us might be adversely affected by their obligations to make prior payments to the creditors of these subsidiaries.
 We own substantially all of our assets through our interest in PREIT Associates. PREIT Associates holds substantially all of its properties and assets through subsidiaries, including subsidiary partnerships and limited liability companies, and derives substantially all of its cash flow from cash distributions to it by its subsidiaries. We, in turn, derive substantially all of our cash flow from cash distributions to us by PREIT Associates. Our direct and indirect subsidiaries must make payments on their obligations to their creditors when due and payable before they may make distributions to us. Thus, PREIT Associates’ ability to make distributions to its partners, including us, depends on its subsidiaries’ ability first to satisfy their obligations to their creditors. Similarly, our ability to pay dividends to holders of our shares depends on PREIT Associates’ ability first to satisfy its obligations to its creditors before making distributions to us. If the subsidiaries were unable to make payments to their creditors when due and payable, or if the subsidiaries had insufficient funds both to make payments to creditors and distribute funds to PREIT Associates, we might not have sufficient cash to satisfy our obligations and/or make distributions to our shareholders. Furthermore, our credit facilities limit our ability to declare and pay dividends on our common and preferred shares, subject to certain exceptions. Even if permissible under our credit facilities, we do not anticipate paying dividends on our shares in the foreseeable future. See “—We do not anticipate paying dividends on our shares in the foreseeable future” for additional information on the limitations imposed by our credit facilities on our ability to make distributions to our shareholders.
 In addition, we will only have the right to participate in any distribution of the assets of any of our direct or indirect subsidiaries upon the liquidation, reorganization or insolvency of such subsidiary after the claims of the creditors, including mortgage lenders and trade creditors, of that subsidiary are satisfied. Our shareholders, in turn, will have the right to participate in any distribution of our assets upon our liquidation, reorganization or insolvency only after the claims of our creditors, including trade creditors, are satisfied.
 Some of our properties are owned or ground-leased by subsidiaries that we created solely to own or ground-lease those properties. The mortgaged properties and related assets are restricted solely for the payment of the related loans and are not available to pay our other debts, which could impair our ability to borrow, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
 We are subject to risks associated with increases in interest rates, including in connection with our variable interest rate debt.
 As of December 31, 2021, we had $1.2 billion of indebtedness with variable interest rates, although we have fixed the interest rates on an aggregate of $300.0 million of this variable rate debt by using derivative instruments. In addition, our unconsolidated partnerships have $121.8 million, at our proportionate share, of indebtedness with variable rates. We might incur additional variable rate debt in the future, and, if we do

so, the proportion of our debt with variable interest rates might increase. See “Part I. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”
 An increase in market interest rates applicable to the variable portion of the debt portfolio would increase the interest incurred and cash flows necessary to service such debt, subject to our hedging arrangements on such debt. This has and could, in the future, adversely affect our results of operations. Also, in coming years, as our current mortgage loans mature, if these mortgage loans are refinanced at higher interest rates than the rates in effect at the time of the prior loans, our interest expense in connection with debt secured by our properties will increase, and could adversely affect our results of operations.
 We may be adversely affected by the discontinuation of LIBOR.
 
In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) announced it would no longer compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. As a result, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized the Alternative Reference Rates Committee which identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as its preferred alternative to USD-LIBOR. The FCA no longer publishes one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rates and plans to cease publishing all other LIBOR tenors (overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and 12-month) on June 30, 2023. It is not presently known whether SOFR or any other alternative reference rates will attain broad market acceptance as replacements of LIBOR. There remains uncertainty as to how the financial services industry will address the discontinuance of LIBOR in financial instruments that are indexed to LIBOR. Further, various financial instruments indexed to LIBOR could experience different outcomes based on their contractual terms, ability to amend those terms, market or product type, legal or regulatory jurisdiction, and other factors. Alternative reference rates that replace LIBOR may not yield the same or similar economic results over the lives of the financial instruments, which could adversely affect the value of and return on these instruments.
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had borrowings under our Credit Agreements and mortgage loans of $1.4 billion with interest rates indexed to LIBOR. We are monitoring and evaluating the risks related to changes in LIBOR availability, which include potential changes in interest paid on debt and amounts received and paid on interest rate swaps and other derivative instruments. These risks arise in connection with transitioning contracts to a new alternative rate, including any resulting value transfer that may occur. The value of loans, securities, and derivative instruments tied to LIBOR could also be affected if LIBOR is limited or discontinued. For some instruments, the method of transitioning to an alternative rate may be challenging, as they may require negotiation with the respective counterparty.
    If a contract is not transitioned to an alternative rate and LIBOR is discontinued, the impact on our contracts is likely to vary by contract. If LIBOR is phased out and changes are implemented, interest rates on our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected.
 Our actual financial results after emergence from bankruptcy may not be comparable to our historical financial information as a result of the implementation of the Plan and the transactions contemplated thereby.
 In the Disclosure Statement Relating to the Joint Prepackaged Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization of Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust and Certain of Its Direct and Indirect Subsidiaries (including any exhibits, appendices, schedules, ballots and related documents thereto, the “Disclosure Statement”) that we filed pursuant to section 1125 of the Bankruptcy Code with the Bankruptcy Court during the Chapter 11 Cases, we included financial projections as required by the Bankruptcy Code to demonstrate to the bankruptcy court the feasibility of the Plan and establish that we will have sufficient liquidity and be able to meet our financial obligations under the Plan and in the ordinary course of our business upon emergence from bankruptcy. Those projections were prepared solely for the purpose of the bankruptcy proceedings and have not been, and will not be, updated on an ongoing basis and should not be relied upon by investors. At the time they were prepared, the projections included in the Disclosure Statement reflected numerous assumptions concerning our then-anticipated future performance and with respect to prevailing and anticipated market and economic conditions that were and remain beyond our control and that may not materialize. Projections are inherently subject to substantial and numerous uncertainties and to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks, including risks related to or deriving from the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences, and the assumptions underlying the projections and/or valuation estimates may ultimately prove to be inaccurate in material respects. There is no guarantee that the financial projections included in the Disclosure Statement will be realized, and actual results may vary significantly from those contemplated by the projections. As a result, investors should not consider the financial projections to be assurances or guarantees of future performance.
RISKS RELATING TO OUR ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE
 Our organizational documents contain provisions that might discourage a takeover of us and depress our share price.
 Our organizational documents contain, or might contain in the future, provisions that might have an anti-takeover effect and might inhibit a change in our management and the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our securities. These provisions currently include:


(1)There are ownership limits and restrictions on transferability in our trust agreement. In order to protect our status as a REIT, no more than 50% of the value of our outstanding shares (after taking into account options to acquire shares) may be owned, directly or constructively, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended), and the shares must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year. Moreover, if a person owns 10% or more of the value of our outstanding shares, rents paid by the person or certain related parties may not be treated as rental income for purposes of the 75% and 95% income tests that apply for REIT qualification. To assist us in satisfying these tests, subject to some exceptions, our trust agreement prohibits any shareholder from owning more than 9.9% of our outstanding shares of beneficial interest (exclusive of preferred shares) or more than 9.9% of any class or series of preferred shares. The trust agreement also prohibits transfers of shares that would cause a shareholder to exceed the 9.9% limit or cause our shares to be beneficially owned by fewer than 100 persons. Our Board of Trustees may exempt a person from the 9.9% ownership limit if it receives a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service or an opinion of counsel or tax accountants that exceeding the 9.9% ownership limit as to that person would not jeopardize our tax status as a REIT. In the past, our Board has granted such exemptions to Invesco Exchange-Traded Fund Trust II, Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc., Blackrock, Inc., CBRE Clarion Securities, Heitman Real Estate Securities, Security Capital Research and Management and Nuveen Assets Management LLC. Absent an exemption, this restriction might:
 
•discourage, delay or prevent a tender offer or other transaction or a change in control of management that might involve a premium price for our shares or otherwise be in the best interests of our shareholders; or
 •compel a shareholder who had acquired more than 9.9% of our shares to transfer the additional shares to a trust and, as a result, to forfeit the benefits of owning the additional shares.
 (2) Our Trust Agreement permits our Board of Trustees to issue preferred shares with terms that might discourage a third party from acquiring the Company. Our Trust Agreement permits our Board of Trustees to create and issue multiple classes and series of preferred shares, and classes and series of preferred shares having preferences to the existing shares on any matter, without a vote of shareholders, including preferences in rights in liquidation or to dividends and option rights, and other securities having conversion or option rights. Also, the Board might authorize the creation and issuance by our subsidiaries and affiliates of securities having conversion and option rights in respect of our shares. Our Trust Agreement further provides that the terms of such rights or other securities might provide for disparate treatment of certain holders or groups of holders of such rights or other securities. The issuance of such rights or other securities could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of us, even if a change in control were in our shareholders’ interest or would give the shareholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our securities.
 (3) Advance Notice Requirements for Shareholder Nominations of Trustees. The Company’s advance notice procedures with regard to shareholder proposals relating to the nomination of candidates for election as trustees, as provided in our amended and restated Trust Agreement, require, among other things, that advance written notice of any such proposals, containing prescribed information, be given to our Secretary at our principal executive offices not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the prior year’s meeting (or within 10 business days of the day notice is given of the annual meeting date, if the annual meeting date is not within 30 days of the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting).
 Limited partners of PREIT Associates may vote on certain fundamental changes we propose, which could inhibit a change in control that might otherwise result in a premium to our shareholders.
 Our assets generally are held through our interests in PREIT Associates. We currently hold a majority of the outstanding limited partnership interests (“OP Units”) in PREIT Associates. However, PREIT Associates might, from time to time, issue additional OP Units to third parties in exchange for contributions of property to PREIT Associates in amounts that could, individually or in the aggregate, be substantial. These issuances will dilute our percentage ownership of PREIT Associates. OP Units generally do not carry a right to vote on any matter voted on by our shareholders, although OP Units might, under certain circumstances, be redeemed for our shares. However, before the date on which at least half of the units issued on September 30, 1997 in connection with our acquisition of The Rubin Organization have been redeemed, the holders of units issued on September 30, 1997 are entitled to vote such units together with our shareholders, as a single class, on any proposal

to merge, consolidate or sell substantially all of our assets. Joseph F. Coradino, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is among the holders of these units.
These existing rights could inhibit a change in control that might otherwise result in a premium to our shareholders. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will not agree to extend comparable rights to other limited partners in PREIT Associates.
 We have, in the past, and might again, in the future, enter into tax protection agreements for the benefit of certain former property owners, including some limited partners of PREIT Associates, that might affect our ability to sell or refinance some of our properties that we might otherwise want to sell or refinance, which could harm our financial condition.
 As the general partner of PREIT Associates, we have previously agreed to indemnify certain former property owners against tax liabilities that they might incur if we sell a property in a taxable transaction or significantly reduce the debt secured by a property acquired from them within a certain number of years after we acquired it, and we might do so again in the future. In some cases, these agreements might make it uneconomical for us to sell or refinance these properties, even in circumstances in which it otherwise would be advantageous to do so, which could interfere with our ability to execute strategic dispositions, harm our ability to address liquidity needs in the future or otherwise harm our financial condition.
 RISKS RELATING TO OUR SECURITIES
 We could face adverse consequences as a result of the actions of activist shareholders.
 In recent years, proxy contests and other forms of shareholder activism have been directed against numerous public companies, including us. Shareholders may engage in proxy solicitations, advance shareholder proposals, or otherwise attempt to effect changes in or acquire control over us. Campaigns by shareholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase short-term shareholder value through actions such as financial restructuring, increased debt, special dividends, share repurchases, or sales of assets or the entire company. Shareholder activists may also seek to involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction and operations of the company.
 If a shareholder, by itself or in conjunction with other shareholders or as part of a group, engages in activist activities with respect to us, our business could be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, potentially disrupting operations and diverting the attention of our Board of Trustees, senior management and employees from the execution of business strategies. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction might result in the loss of potential business opportunities and harm our ability to attract new tenants, customers and investors. If individuals are elected to our Board of Trustees with a specific agenda, it might adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategies and initiatives and to retain and attract experienced executives and employees. Finally, we might experience a significant increase in legal fees and administrative and associated costs incurred in connection with responding to a proxy contest or related action. These actions could also negatively affect our share price.
 
Because we have not paid dividends on our outstanding preferred shares for six quarters, the holders of the outstanding preferred shares, voting together as a single class, have the right to elect two additional trustees to our Board. On February 23, 2022, we received a notice from a holder of the outstanding preferred proposing to nominate two individuals to be elected to serve as two additional trustees to our Board at our upcoming 2022 annual meeting. If the holders of our outstanding preferred shares elect additional trustees with a specific agenda (such as pursuing strategies to benefit holders of our preferred shares), the risks described above could be exacerbated.
 A few significant shareholders may influence or control the direction of our business, and, if the ownership of our common shares continues to be concentrated, or becomes more concentrated in the future, it could prevent our other shareholders from influencing significant corporate decisions.
 As of December 31, 2021, a small number of individual shareholders together own or control more than 10% of our outstanding common shares. Although these investors do not act as a group, they may be able to exercise influence over matters requiring shareholder approval,

including approval of significant corporate transactions that might affect the price of our shares. The concentration of ownership of our shares held by these investors may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without their support.
The interests of these investors may conflict with our interests or the interests of our other shareholders. For example, the concentration of ownership with these investors could allow them to influence our policies and strategies and could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or business combination from occurring that might otherwise be favorable to us and our other shareholders.
 Holders of our common shares might have their interest in us diluted by actions we take in the future.
 We continue to contemplate ways to reduce our leverage through a variety of means available to us, subject to the terms of the Credit Agreements. These means might include obtaining equity capital, including through the issuance of common or preferred equity or equity-related securities if market conditions are favorable. In addition, we might contemplate acquisitions of properties or portfolios, and we might issue equity, in the form of common shares, OP Units or other equity securities in consideration for such acquisitions, potentially in substantial amounts. Any issuance of equity securities might result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common shares held by our then existing shareholders, and the interest of our shareholders might be materially adversely affected. The market price of our common shares could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares in the market or the perception that such sales could occur. Additionally, future sales or issuances of substantial amounts of our common shares might be at prices below the then-current market price of our common shares and might adversely affect the market price of our common shares.
 Many factors, including changes in interest rates and the negative perceptions of the retail sector generally, can have an adverse effect on the market value of our securities.
 As is the case with other publicly traded companies, a number of factors might adversely affect the price of our securities, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:
 •Increases in market interest rates, which could cause certain prospective purchasers to invest elsewhere. Higher market interest rates would not, however, result in more funds being available for us to distribute to shareholders and, to the contrary, would likely increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution to our shareholders, if any. Thus, higher market interest rates could cause the market price of our shares to decrease;
 •A decline in the anticipated benefits of an investment in our securities as compared to an investment in securities of companies in other industries (including benefits associated with the tax treatment of any dividends and distributions);
 •Perception, by market professionals and participants, of REITs generally and REITs in the retail sector, and malls in particular. Our portfolio of properties consists almost entirely of retail properties and we expect to continue to focus primarily on retail properties in the future;
 •Perception by market participants of our potential for growth;
 •Levels and concentrations of institutional investor and research analyst interest in our securities;
 •Relatively low trading volumes in securities of REITs;
 •Our results of operations and financial condition; and
 •Investor confidence in the stock market or the real estate sector generally.
 We do not anticipate paying dividends on our shares in the foreseeable future.
 Our Credit Agreements limit our ability to declare and pay dividends on our common and preferred shares, subject to certain exceptions, and thus we have deferred payments on our preferred shares and suspended payments on our common shares. We do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends to holders of our common or preferred shares for the foreseeable future. Any future payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Trustees and will depend on numerous factors in addition to the terms and conditions of our Credit Agreements, including our cash flow, financial condition, capital requirements, annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, and other factors that our Board of Trustees deems relevant. We cannot assure you that we will be able to pay dividends on our shares in the future. Consequently, you should not rely on dividends to receive a return on your investment. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities.

Because we have not paid dividends on our outstanding preferred shares for six quarters, the holders of the outstanding preferred shares, voting together as a single class, have the right to elect two additional trustees to our Board. On February 23, 2022, we received a notice from a holder of the outstanding preferred proposing to nominate two individuals to be elected to serve as two additional trustees to our Board at our upcoming 2022 annual meeting. This could have an adverse impact on our governance and on the interests of our shareholders other than the holders of our preferred shares if additional trustees are elected and focus primarily on pursuing strategies to benefit holders of our preferred shares.


The dividend arrearage created by the suspension of dividends that continue to accrue on our outstanding preferred shares also will require that we not resume any payment of cash dividends on our common shares unless full cumulative dividends accrued with respect to our preferred shares for all past quarters have been paid (or funds have been set apart for payment of such dividends). We suspended our Distribution Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan (the “DRIP”) effective as of September 24, 2020 and, due in part to the fact that we are no longer able to register the offer and sale of securities on Form S-3, we have no present intention to reactivate the DRIP.
 Individual taxpayers might perceive REIT securities as less desirable relative to the securities of other corporations because of the lower tax rate on certain dividends from such corporations, to the extent we pay dividends in the future, which might have an adverse effect on the market value of our securities.
 Currently, the maximum federal income tax rate on dividends, excluding tax on net investment income, from most publicly traded corporations is 20%. Dividends from REITs, however, do not qualify for this favorable tax treatment, and the maximum federal income tax rate on dividends from REITs is 29.6% (which excludes tax on new investment income). It is possible also that tax legislation enacted in subsequent years might increase this rate differential. Our credit facilities limit our ability to pay dividends on our common and preferred shares, subject to certain exceptions, and thus we have deferred payments on our preferred shares and suspended payments on our common shares. To the extent we pay dividends in the future, the differing treatment of dividends received from REITs and other corporations might cause individual investors to view an investment in REITs as less attractive relative to other corporations, which might negatively affect the value of our shares.
 Our common shares could be delisted from the NYSE if we fail to meet applicable continued listing requirements, which could have materially adverse effects on our business.
 
Our common shares are listed on the NYSE and, as such, are subject to the exchange’s listing standards, including the requirement to maintain an average closing price of at least $1.00 per share. In 2020, we were notified by NYSE that we had failed to meet such requirement, but regained compliance as of December 31, 2020 after the closing price for our common shares on December 31, 2020 and the average closing price for our common shares during the 30 trading-day period ended December 31, 2020 both exceeded $1.00.

Although we have maintained compliance as of December 31, 2021, during 2021, the closing price for our common shares has ranged from a low of $0.88 per share to a high of $3.17 per share. Accordingly, there is a risk we may fail to continue to meet this listing standard and, if we fail to comply in the future, in accordance with Rule 802.01D of the NYSE’s Listed Company Manual, the NYSE may suspend and delist our common shares and preferred shares. On February 4, 2022, we received a notice from NYSE that we are no longer in compliance with the NYSE continued listing standard set forth in Section 802.01C of the NYSE's Listed Company Manual, and we have notified the NYSE that we intend to cure the deficiency. The threat of delisting and/or a delisting of our shares could have adverse effects by, among other things:
 •reducing the liquidity and market price of our common shares;
 •reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common shares; and
 •reducing our ability to retain, recruit and motivate our trustees, officers and employees.
 Any additional issuances of preferred shares in the future might adversely affect the earnings per share available to common shareholders and amounts available to common shareholders for any future payments of dividends.
 The market value of our common shares is based primarily upon the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings, net operating income, funds from operations, our liquidity and capital resources, and cash distributions. Consequently, our common shares might trade at prices that are higher or lower than our net asset value per common share. If our future earnings, net operating income, funds from operations or cash distributions are less than expected, it is likely that the market price of our common shares will decrease. These metrics might be adversely affected by the existence of preferred shares, including our existing preferred shares and any additional preferred shares that we might issue. Our Credit Agreements include certain restrictions on our ability to issue redeemable securities, subject to exceptions for shares that are redeemable solely in exchange for common shares or other equivalents, and further require us to make mandatory prepayments of loans upon receipt of certain threshold levels of net cash proceeds from equity issuances.
 TAX RISKS
 
If we were to fail to qualify as a REIT or otherwise to comply with tax requirements applicable to REITs, our shareholders would be adversely affected.
 
We believe that we have qualified as a REIT since our inception and intend to continue to qualify as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, however, we must comply with certain highly technical and complex requirements under the Internal Revenue Code, which is complicated in the case of a REIT such as ours that holds its assets primarily in partnership form. We cannot be certain we have complied with these requirements because there are very limited judicial and administrative interpretations of these provisions, and even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our REIT status. In addition, facts and circumstances that might be beyond our control might affect our ability to qualify as a REIT. We cannot assure you that new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not change the tax laws significantly with respect to our qualification as a REIT or with respect to the federal income tax consequences of qualification.
 

If we were to fail to qualify as a REIT, we would be subject to federal income tax, on our taxable income, if any, at regular corporate rates. Also, unless the Internal Revenue Service granted us relief under statutory provisions, we would remain disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we first failed to qualify. Any such additional tax incurred at regular corporate rates could significantly reduce the cash flow available for future distribution to shareholders and for debt service. In addition, we would no longer be required to make any distributions to shareholders and our securities could be delisted from the exchange on which they are listed. If there were a determination that we do not qualify as a REIT, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and there could be a material reduction in the value of our common shares.
 
Furthermore, as a REIT, we might be subject to a 100% “prohibited transactions” tax on the gain from dispositions of property if we are deemed to hold the property primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, unless the disposition qualifies under a safe harbor exception for properties that have been held for at least two years and with respect to which certain other requirements are met. The potential application of the prohibited transactions tax could cause us to forego or delay potential dispositions of property or other opportunities that might otherwise be attractive to us, or to undertake such dispositions or other opportunities through a taxable REIT subsidiary, which would generally result in income taxes being incurred. A failure to comply with applicable REIT requirements regarding the minimum percentages of our income that must be derived from real estate or investment income might also result in additional tax liabilities for us.
 We might be unable to comply with the strict income distribution requirements applicable to REITs, or compliance with such requirements could adversely affect our financial condition or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities.
 To obtain the favorable tax treatment associated with qualifying as a REIT, in general, we are required each year to distribute to our shareholders at least 90% of our net taxable income. In addition, we are subject to a tax on any undistributed portion of our income at regular corporate rates and might also be subject to a 4% excise tax on this undistributed income. We could be required to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a REIT, even if conditions are not favorable for borrowing, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, compliance with these REIT requirements might cause us to forgo opportunities we would otherwise pursue.
 There is a risk of changes in the tax law applicable to REITs or our tenants.
 Congress, the United States Treasury Department and the IRS frequently revise federal tax laws, regulations and other guidance. We cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be adopted.
 The federal tax legislation that was signed into law on December 22, 2017 (the ‘‘Act’’) made a large quantity of changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Among those changes were a significant reduction in the generally applicable corporate income tax rate (from a top corporate rate of 35% to a flat 21% rate), and a reduction in the rates of taxation on most ordinary REIT dividends to individuals and other noncorporate taxpayers (from a top marginal income tax rate of 39.6% to a top marginal income tax rate of 29.6%, plus, in each case, a 3.8% Medicare tax on net investment income) so as to be lower than the rate applicable to other ordinary income recognized by such taxpayers. The Act also imposes certain additional limitations on the deduction of net operating losses, which may in the future require us to make distributions that will be taxable to our stockholders to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits in order to comply with the annual REIT distribution requirements.
 We also cannot predict the impact that any future federal tax legislation may have on REITs or our tenants. Any such legislative action may prospectively or retroactively modify our tax treatment and, therefore, may adversely affect taxation of us and/or our shareholders. Any legislative action might also negatively affect our tenants and, in turn, affect their ability to pay rent, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
 We could face possible adverse federal, state and local tax audits and changes in state and local tax laws, which might result in an increase in our tax liability.
 In the normal course of business, certain subsidiaries through which we own real estate have undergone, are currently undergoing or may undergo tax audits. There can be no assurance that the ultimate outcomes of any such audits will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
 From time to time, changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which might result in an increase in our tax liability including potentially increases in the real estate taxes due on the properties we own. The shortfall in tax revenue for many states and municipalities in recent years might lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we might be required to pay additional taxes on our assets, including our properties, or income. We might be unable to effectively pass these increased costs onto our existing tenants and such increased costs may make our properties less appealing to renewing tenants and potential new tenants, which could negatively affect our occupancy rates. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
