ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Introduction
 
Mountain Crest Acquisition Corp. II (the “Company”) is a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 31, 2020. We were formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to herein as our “initial business combination.” Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular geographic region or industry, although it is our intention to pursue prospective targets that are in North America.
 
On January 12, 2021, the Company consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 5,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, $0.0001 par value (“Common Stock”), and one right (“Right”) to receive one-tenth (1/10) of a share of common stock upon the consummation of an initial business combination. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $50,000,000.
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) with Mountain Crest Capital LLC and Chardan Capital Markets, LLC of 185,000 units (the “Private Units”), generating total proceeds of $1,850,000. The Private Units are identical to the Units sold as part of the public Units in our initial public offering. Additionally, such initial purchasers agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Units or underlying securities (except in limited circumstances, as described in the Registration Statement) until the completion of the Company’s initial business combination. Such initial purchasers were granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the purchase of the Private Units.
 
On January 14, 2021, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option and the Company issued the over-allotment option Units to the underwriters. The total aggregate issuance by the Company of the over-allotment option Units at a price of $10.00 per unit resulted in total gross proceeds of $7,500,000. On January 14, 2021, simultaneously with the sale of the over-allotment option Units, the Company consummated the private sale of an additional 15,000 Private Units, generating gross proceeds of $150,000. The Private Units were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering.
 
A total of $57,500,000 of the net proceeds from the sale of Units in the initial public offering (including the over-allotment option Units) and the Private Placements on January 12, 2021 and January 14, 2021, were placed in a trust account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee, established for the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders. None of the funds held in trust will be released from the trust account, other than to pay our income or other tax obligations until the earlier of (i) the consummation of the Company’s initial business combination, and (ii) the Company’s liquidation due to its failure to consummate a business combination within 9 months from the closing of the Company’s initial public offering (or 12 or 15 months, as applicable).
 
Emerging Growth Company Status and Other Information
 
We are an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (which we refer to herein as the JOBS Act). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised, and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statement with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.

We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the date of the IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three year period.
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, the requirement that we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into the business combination, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights and the number of our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination.
Employees
 
We have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once a suitable target business to consummate our initial business combination with has been located, management will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time on our affairs) than had been spent prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote an average of approximately 10 hours per week to our business. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
