Our largest customers include a number of recognized national and regional utilities, industrial companies and engineering, procurement and construction firms located in North America. In addition, we sell our products through hundreds of electrical distributors served by our network of stocking locations throughout the U.S. and Canada. We intend to grow our business through internal product development, expansion of our sales force coverage and through acquisitions to increase the scope and relevance of highly-engineered solutions and technical service we offer our customers for their specific electrical applications.
 
Description of Business Segments
 
In 2016, we had two reportable segments: Transmission & Distribution Solutions (“T&D Solutions”) and Critical Power Solutions (“Critical Power”). 
 

● | Our T&D Solutions business provides equipment solutions that help customers effectively and efficiently manage their electrical power distribution systems to desired specifications. The reporting segment is comprised of two primary product categories: electrical transformers and switchgear. These solutions are marketed principally through our Pioneer Transformers Ltd. (“PTL”), Jefferson Electric, Inc. (“Jefferson”), Bemag Transformers, Inc. (“Bemag”), Pioneer Critical Power, Inc. (“PCPI”) and Pioneer Custom Electric Products, Inc. (“PCEP”) brand names. As a result of the restructuring plans implemented during calendar year 2015, the activities of our PCPI switchgear operations have been transferred from the Critical Power segment to the T&D Solutions segment as of January 1, 2016. For comparison purposes, prior periods presented have been adjusted to reflect this reclassification. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Our Critical Power business provides customers with sophisticated power generation equipment and an advanced data collection and monitoring platform, the combination of which is used to ensure smooth, uninterrupted power to operations during times of emergency. These solutions are marketed by our operations headquartered in Minnesota, currently doing business under the Titan Energy Systems Inc. (“Titan”) brand name. 

T&D Solutions Segment
 
We design, develop, manufacture and sell a wide range of electrical transmission and distribution equipment and our emphasis is to provide custom engineered, manufactured-to-order solutions, which we estimate currently represents over two-thirds of our T&D revenue. We believe that demand for our custom solutions is driven primarily by end user maintenance programs to repair, replace or retrofit aging equipment, as well as to upgrade or expand their electrical distribution systems to accommodate growth and other changes in their operations. In addition, a significant portion of our custom solutions revenue is derived from the production of magnetic subassemblies incorporated by original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) into the systems they sell, systems which in the case of our customers are principally being used for data center, elevator control and electric drive applications. The remainder of our T&D Solutions revenue is derived from our catalogue of standard transformer designs, models which are sold primarily through electrical distributors and to brand label customers. These products are manufactured to stock and are used in general purpose electrical applications, with demand being driven by the overall pace of new commercial construction.
 
We distinguish ourselves by producing a wide range of engineered-to-order and standard equipment, sold either directly to end users, through manufacturers’ representatives and engineering and construction firms or through electrical distributors. We serve customers in a variety of industries including electric utilities, industrial customers, OEMs, commercial firms, contractors and renewable energy producers.

Overview of Electrical Transformers
 
Our liquid-filled and dry-type power, distribution and specialty electrical transformers are magnetic products used in the control and conditioning of electrical current for critical processes. An electric transformer is used to increase or decrease the voltage of electricity traveling through a power line. This change in voltage is accomplished by transferring electric energy from one internal coil or winding to another coil through electromagnetic induction. Electric power generating plants use generator transformers to “step-up,” or increase, voltage that is transferred through power lines in order to transmit the electricity more efficiently over long distances. When high voltage electricity nears its final destination, a “step-down” transformer reduces its voltage. A distribution transformer makes a final step-down in voltage to a level usable in businesses and homes.
 
Transformers are integral to every electrical transmission and distribution system. Electric utilities use transformers for the construction and maintenance of their power networks. Industrial firms use transformers to supply factories with electricity and to distribute power to production machinery. The renewable energy industry uses transformers to connect new sources of electricity generation to the power grid. The construction industry uses transformers for the supply of electricity to new homes and buildings and original equipment manufacturers use custom transformers as a component part of the systems they make.
 
We manufacture liquid-filled transformers at our facility in Granby, Quebec. Liquid-filled transformers are typically used for applications handling utility or industrial-level electrical loads, such as in a substation, and are most commonly found in outdoor settings given the risk of leakage and the flammable properties of the liquid coolant, typically mineral oil. We manufacture these products in electrical power ranges from 25 kVA (kilovolt amperes) to 30 MVA (megavolt amperes) and at up to 69 kV (kilovolts) in voltage. In recent years, we have focused primarily on the small power market, generally considered to include transformers between 1 MVA and 10 MVA, as well as on specialty transformers such as network and submersible designs used by utilities to withstand harsh environments and ensure reliability of service. We sell these products to electrical utilities, independent power providers, electrical co-ops, industrial companies, commercial users and electric equipment wholesalers. All of our liquid-filled transformers are designed and manufactured specifically to a customer order.

We manufacture dry-type transformers and custom magnetics at our facilities in Farnham, Quebec and Reynosa, Mexico. The largest and longest-standing component of our dry-type transformer revenue consists of low voltage, standard distribution units sold from our catalogue of over 1,000 designs. These units are typically used indoors to handle general loads for powering commercial and industrial machinery and equipment requiring 50 VA (volt amperes) through 1 MVA of power transformation capacity in voltages at or below 600 V (volts). In recent years, we have focused primarily on custom-engineered solutions – including equipment for OEM applications, and transformers in the medium voltage and power-dry product classes where our range extends to 10 MVA and to 35 kV in voltage. Medium voltage and power-dry transformers are conventionally used for indoor applications and in metropolitan areas, and are increasingly being used outdoors and indoors for commercial, industrial, manufacturing and production process applications. They are engineered to meet the most onerous duty requirements and are well-suited to operate in harsh environmental conditions, a situation which occurs frequently when the transformer needs to be installed close to the area where the power will ultimately be used, such as in down-hole mining or on drilling rigs. 
 
We also offer a broad array of magnetically-driven solutions to ensure clean power and eliminate potential issues caused by harmonics and transients, including proprietary solutions that incorporate our patented technology through the use of power electronics. Our power quality solutions are for use in industrial, commercial and institutional settings where sensitive automation equipment is being used and clean, efficient power is required.
 
Overview of Switchgear
 
There are many different classes of switchgear, a generic term that encompasses the finished assembly of a system of devices utilizing electrical disconnects, fuses and circuit breakers, whose general function is to distribute, control and monitor the flow of electrical energy, while isolating and protecting critical equipment such as transformers, motors and other electrically powered machinery. 
 
We design and manufacture low voltage electric power distribution panel boards, low and medium voltage switchgear and switchboards manufactured at our facility in Southern California. This location specializes in quick-turn, manufactured-to-order circuit protection and control equipment, primarily serving electrical distributors in the region. In addition, it incorporates transformers manufactured at other Pioneer locations into specialty products, such as unit substations, and also serves to supply our PSG solutions with several classes of switchgear used in its customer projects.
 
Additional product categories include paralleling switchgear (PSG), automatic transfer switches (ATS) and provide other necessary equipment to create a reliable and dependable power generation system. The primary function of our PSG solutions is to reliably switch the power source to the load, protect and operate the power generation source(s), meter output and provide paralleling and load sharing capability between multiple on-site power sources and the utility grid. Our PSG solution specializes in customized equipment and controls for complex primary power applications, enabling on-site users to parallel multiple power sources with the utility power grid, in combined heat, power and cooling applications, and for peak shaving and demand/load side management of electrical power. PSG is an integral component to ensuring optimal power generation and electrical distribution system performance, both for primary and backup power installations. Installations requiring a PSG solution typically involve more complex and redundant power schemes, such as in data centers, hospitals, industrial facilities, remote locations not connected to the power grid and other sites where emergency backup power sources are a necessity to protect operations from the consequences of blackouts or brownouts. Our focus is on larger installations where a single engine generator, or “genset”, is not sufficient or where multiple gensets may be required to provide system resilience. We believe that our PSG solutions represent a scalable, cost-effective and intelligent automation option through their embedded programming and logic to synchronize multiple on-site power sources and the capability to operate them in concert with the utility feed(s).
 
Critical Power Segment
 
Our Critical Power segment is engaged in designing, manufacturing, selling, commissioning and aftermarket service of onsite power generation and control equipment. Our systems are used to maintain reliable emergency standby power at facilities where it is either required or where the potential consequences of a power outage make it necessary – such as at data centers, hospitals, communications facilities, factories, national retailers, military sites, office complexes and other critical operations. 
 
Depending on the needs of our customers, we offer our solutions on a complete equipment package basis, or as a standalone equipment or service solution that addresses one or more requirements of an overall power project. We believe that our value proposition to customers is differentiated by our use of advanced communications and automated data collection technologies to provide a highly-sophisticated remote monitoring, automated control and reporting platform to our customers.

Power Generation Equipment
 
We provide our industrial and commercial customers with a variety of power generation equipment and fuel options which, depending on their needs and applications, can range from several kilowatts to 2 MW of output per genset. Using the PSG capabilities of our switchgear business unit, we excel in projects requiring multiple gensets in side-by-side arrangements that are paralleled for synchronous operation. 
 
Our Critical Power business is the sole authorized distributor for the Industrial Power equipment and parts of Generac Power Systems Inc. (“Generac”) in the states of Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin and Nebraska, and one of only 32 such distributors throughout North America. Outside of these five Midwestern states, we sell power generation equipment made by all major manufacturers, including Generac. In order to more competitively serve our customers, we regularly provide Pioneer-manufactured power distribution equipment to each project, including switchgear and transformers. We also offer niche solutions such as GenMax® – our proprietary harmonic suppression technology that resolves power reliability and genset capacity issues frequently encountered when new gensets are introduced to a system of existing gensets, where the make, model and power output of the gensets within the system are different.
 
To fully meet the onsite power reliability needs of our customers, we realize a small portion of our revenue from the sale of uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems. UPS systems are used by data-intensive businesses to provide battery backup power to servers until the emergency backup genset(s) come online. Once the gensets are producing proper voltage and frequency, the UPS switches the load onto the gensets. For UPS system sales, we are an authorized dealer for GE and also represent Toshiba, Eaton-Powerware and other manufacturers.
 
Service
 
Power generation systems represent considerable investments that require proper maintenance and service in order to operate reliably during a time of emergency. Our power maintenance programs provide preventative maintenance, repair and support service for our customers’ power generation systems. To support our customers in managing their critical infrastructure, we maintain inventories of equipment and parts, a fleet of service vehicles and a staff of certified field service technicians in the Midwest and Florida. To complete our geographic coverage, we maintain a network of field service partners located in other regions, enabling us to provide quick-response, 24/7 service capability that can effectively service any make and model of back-up power equipment in any city of the United States. Our field service organization services more than 7,500 generators owned by more than 1,200 customers located throughout the United States, including for multi-site, multi-state customers such as Target Corporation and Verizon Corporation.
 
We recognize discrete revenue streams from service contracts, installation and maintenance services, and we offer service contracts to all owners of power generation and related equipment, whether or not the equipment was originally sold by us. Our service agreements have terms ranging from one to five years in duration, provide us with a recurring revenue stream, and generally yield higher margins as compared to genset equipment sales. These service contracts may also include remote monitoring services that allow owners to be informed of the condition and operations of their equipment at any time and from any place.

Remote Monitoring and Automated Control
 
We have dedicated considerable resources to developing and engineering our proprietary remote monitoring and automated control system for onsite power generation. We believe this system enables us to provide a technologically superior service program that benefits our customer from a cost and quality standpoint. In addition, we have developed specialized asset management and auditing tools to more efficiently and cost effectively provide our customers with detailed information about their onsite power systems.  We believe these tools provide us with an advantage over service companies that do not have these technologies, allowing us to compete for work more efficiently, maintain higher service levels and realize higher margins by using these tools.
 
Our monitoring and control system performs 24/7, capturing and monitoring data from up to 100 critical points and functions on the genset, PSG, ATS and UPS, from metering electrical output to emissions. This data is displayed in continuously updated, fully customizable, easy-to-read web-based reporting that provide a complete picture of our customers’ power generation system condition. By tracking and trending real-time performance indicators in combination with the ability to remotely test, start and stop onsite power systems, our network operations center is able to avert potential failures before they occur and immediately respond to emergency situations before a customer calls. Our monitoring and control system is instrumental to ensure that our servicing programs are being administered appropriately in order to optimize system reliability on behalf of our customers. In addition, because our system is completely scalable, we are able to monitor one to thousands of generators nationwide, a solution which is ideally-suited to service our national account customers.
 
Our customers use our monitoring and control system for access to our monitoring dashboard, to view generator performance in real-time, to receive alerts and notifications, track work orders and submit support requests. These capabilities have been combined with automated electronic audit and inventory reporting to form a comprehensive asset management program for our customers, enabling them to quickly and efficiently record, categorize and retrieve vital information about their power generation assets across their facilities. We believe the advantage of these reporting systems is that they help us and our customers to better protect their equipment, while increasing system reliability in times of need and reducing ongoing operating costs for service and repairs through preventative maintenance.
 
Business Strategy
 
We believe we have established a stable platform from which to develop and grow our business lines, revenues, net income and shareholder value. We intend to expand rapidly over the next several years through a two-pronged strategy. First, we are focused on internal growth through operating efficiencies, new product development, customer focus and our continued migration towards more highly-engineered products and specialized services. We intend to significantly increase the percentage of our sales derived from engineered-to-order products and differentiated services and believe this can be accomplished by targeting market segments, such as data centers and independent power producers, which have growth characteristics exceeding the norm in our industry. The second element of our growth strategy is to pursue strategic acquisitions that provide us with complementary product and service offerings, new sales channels, end-markets and scalable operations.
 
Over the last five years, through internal development and acquisitions, we believe we have broadened the array and sophistication of our product and service offerings. Our strategy is to continue to expand the portfolio of solutions we offer in order to address more elements of every electrical infrastructure project. We believe this approach makes us more relevant to our customers, allows us to compete more effectively and increases the number of sales opportunities for our products and solutions.
 
We intend to build our revenue and net income at rates exceeding industry norms through internal growth initiatives and complementary acquisitions. Accomplishing these financial goals will be dependent on a number of factors including our ability to execute the following strategies and actions:
 

● | Evolving from a product-oriented to a customer and market-centric, solutions-oriented organization; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

T&D Solutions Segment
 
We intend to accomplish our growth objectives within our T&D Solutions business by emphasizing our capabilities in the following areas:
 

● | OEM Equipment Solutions ‒ Continue to invest in engineering resources and product development to increase our pipeline of recurring order customers that integrate our magnetic subassemblies and/or components into the products they sell. Our key focus areas for this solution category include providers of motor control/drive systems, factory automation equipment, power distribution units and UPS systems for data centers, HVAC systems, and power quality and conditioning equipment. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Medium Voltage Dry-type Transformers ‒ We acquired this competence in 2011. Growth in this product class will be predicated on expanding our market penetration, particularly in the U.S. where in 2013 we began adding dedicated medium voltage and liquid-filled transformer sales personnel and new independent sales representatives. 
● | Liquid-filled Transformers ‒ Sales of more network, subsurface, small and medium power transformers to new and existing utility and industrial customers, particularly in the U.S. In 2012 we completed a facility expansion in order to increase our production capacity for these higher voltage and more complex solutions. 
● | Paralleling Switchgear (PSG) ‒ Increase our product range to include traditional low voltage and medium voltage, metal clad and metal enclosed switchgear, to be used both in conventional electrical distribution applications, in unitized substations, as well as for supply to our Critical Power business. We believe we excel at large projects for mission critical facilities that require sophisticated standby and primary power redundancy schemes. These projects generally demand higher engineering content due to the necessary customization of the switchgear and related controls, which we believe provides us a stronger basis upon which to compete than in more straight-forward applications. We intend to grow our sales in this product line by adding to our staff of professional sales persons and growing our network of independent manufacturers’ representatives who specialize in critical power. 

Critical Power Segment
 
Within our Critical Power business, we intend to accomplish our growth objectives by implementing the following business initiatives:
 

● | National Service Accounts ‒ We intend to increase the number of national account customers we have by leveraging our scalable, nationwide network of partners which allows us to service standby power systems anywhere in the United States. We are actively marketing our preventive maintenance and technology-enabled monitoring and control services to new national accounts including: major national retailers, telecommunications companies, data centers, banks, hospitals and health care facilities, educational institutions and property management companies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Power generation equipment ‒ Increase our sales of power generation and associated equipment in our existing and new market territories by recruiting qualified, professional sales people, and by broadening the range of ancillary equipment options they have available for sale, including related equipment solutions manufactured by us. We believe that these sales will also create opportunities for us to secure long-term service contracts and deploy our monitoring technologies, programs that generate recurring revenue at attractive profit margins. 

Acquisitions 
 
We believe a disciplined acquisition program is a key component to accelerating our growth and we intend to acquire businesses that broaden the range of customer solutions we provide, increase our market share or expand our geographic reach. In addition to switchgear and transformer manufacturers, we also intend to acquire manufacturing and service businesses focused on other technically-advanced, customized, ancillary or complementary products that address market segments where we seek further penetration, such as in data centers, backup power equipment and service, traction power, renewable energy and natural resources. We operate in a highly fragmented industry that is served by a few global diversified electrical equipment manufacturers and numerous small manufacturing companies that provide niche products and services to various sub-segments of the power transmission and distribution market. We favor candidates that have competencies and business characteristics similar to our own, and those that we expect will benefit from some of the major trends affecting our industry. Our acquisitions since 2010 are examples of the implementation of our acquisition strategy.
Our Industry
 
The market for our largest business segment, electrical T&D equipment, is substantial and has grown over the last several decades. According to a February 2015 study by The Freedonia Group, a market research firm, total U.S. demand for electric T&D equipment was $25.5 billion in 2014 and was distributed by product category as follows: switchgear (54%), transformers (33%), meters (7%) and pole/transmission line hardware (6%). The Freedonia Group forecasts demand for switchgear and for transformers to climb 6.1% and 4.5% annually to $28.9 billion collectively in 2019, as compared to 5.5% and 2.0% annual growth for these categories between 2009 and 2014, driven by rising utilization of renewable energy sources and increasing demand from the industrial and non-utility generator markets.

7
-


Most of our business today consists of manufacturing power, distribution and non-utility transformers, although we have become increasingly engaged in producing conventional and certain specialty categories of electrical switchgear. Utilities, industrial and commercial firms purchase transformers to replace old equipment, maintain system reliability, achieve efficiency improvements and for substation or grid expansion. Demand is also sensitive to overall economic conditions, particularly with respect to the level of industrial production and investment in commercial and residential construction. Other market demand factors include voltage conversion, voltage unit upgrades, electrical equipment failures, higher energy costs, stricter environmental regulations and investment in sources of renewable and distributed energy generation.
 
The market for switchgear and related equipment is significantly larger and more complex given the number and classes of solutions available. Within our Critical Power segment, we believe that our PSG and ATS switchgear offerings, together with our service programs for power generation and ancillary equipment, addresses annual U.S. demand exceeding $2.0 billion.
 
 The market for T&D equipment and Critical Power solutions is very fragmented due to the range of equipment types, electrical and mechanical properties, technological standards and service parameters required by different categories of end users for their specific applications. Many orders are custom-engineered and tend to be time-sensitive since other critical work is frequently being coordinated around the customer’s electrical equipment installation. The vast majority of North American demand for the types of solutions we provide is satisfied by thousands of producers and service companies in the U.S. and Canada.
 
We believe several of the key industry trends supporting future growth in our industry are as follows:
 

● | Aging and Overburdened North American Power Grid — The aging and overburdened North American power grid is expected to require significant capital expenditures to upgrade the existing infrastructure over the next several years to maintain adequate levels of reliability and efficiency. Significant capital investment will be required to relieve congestion, meet growing demand, achieve targets for efficiency, emissions and use of renewable sources, and to replace components of the U.S. power grid operating at, near or past their planned service lives. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Increasing Long-Term Demand for Electricity and Reliable Power — The Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration, or EIA, forecasts that total electricity use in the U.S. will increase by approximately 28% from 2011 to 2040. This increase is driven by anticipated population growth, economic expansion, increasing dependence on computing power throughout the economy and the increased use of electrical devices in the home. In order to meet growing demand for electricity in North America, substantial investment in increased electrical grid capacity and efficiency will be required, as well as the addition of specialized equipment to help ensure the reliability and quality of electricity for critical applications. In response to these challenges, there is an increasing trend among commercial and industrial companies to invest in on-site power sources, both for standby purposes in the event of a catastrophic power outage, or to reduce the amount of electricity they draw from the utility grid during peak periods. 
● | Growth in Critical Power Applications and the Data Center Market — The number of mission-critical facilities, sites where a power disturbance or outage could cause failure of business operations, safety concerns or regulatory non-compliance, continues to grow exponentially worldwide. In the U.S., the single largest driver for demand in critical power applications is the data center market, followed by the health care industry. The amount of information managed by data centers is expected to grow, fueled by increasing needs for data storage (for corporate data, content delivery, social networking, handheld devices, online retail and gaming) and the information technology evolution (cloud computing and outsourced hosting). Coinciding with demand for mission-critical facilities is the need for efficient, reliable primary power to support their essential applications, and for backup generator plants in case the utility feed becomes unavailable. Electricity is the highest operating cost of a data center, a factor supporting investment in on-site alternative energy systems to reduce peak-demand expenses. These systems require paralleling switchgear, such as we provide, operated by hardware embedded with sophisticated programming and logic to synchronize multiple power sources reliably and efficiently.

Customers
 
For the year ended December 31, 2016 approximately 27% of our sales were to Canadian customers, including many of Canada’s electrical utilities, municipal power systems, large industrial companies, engineering and construction firms and a number of electrical distributors. Another 72% of our sales in 2016 were to U.S. customers, represented in large part by companies involved in commercial construction. Less than 1% of our sales were to export customers primarily serving the Central and Latin American markets. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold our electrical equipment and services to over 2,200 individual customers and our twenty largest customers represented approximately 51% of our consolidated revenue.

-


Approximately 15% and 10% of our sales in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were made to Siemens and its affiliated companies. Our pricing agreement with Siemens does not obligate Siemens to purchase transformers from us in quantities consistent with the past or at all.
 
While the loss of a significant number of customers would have a material adverse effect on our business, aside from Siemens, we do not believe that the loss of any specific customer would have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Marketing, Sales and Distribution
 
A substantial portion of the transformers manufactured by us, and most of the switchgear products we offer, are sold directly to customers by our 18 full-time marketing and sales personnel and 6 members of our executive management team operating from our office locations in the U.S. and Canada. Our products are also sold through our network of more than 64 independent sales agencies throughout North America that sell primarily to full-line electrical distributors and to maintenance, repair and overhaul organizations. Our direct sales force markets to end users and to third parties, such as original equipment manufacturers and engineering firms that prescribe the specifications and parameters that control the applications of our products.
Sales Backlog
 
Backlog reflects the amount of revenue we expect to realize upon the shipment of customer orders for our products that are not yet complete or for which work has not yet begun. Our sales backlog as of December 31, 2016 was approximately $38.6 million, as compared to $28.7 million as of December 31, 2015. We anticipate that most of our current backlog will be delivered during 2017. Orders included in our sales backlog are represented by customer purchase orders and contracts that we believe to be firm.
Competition
 
We experience intense competition from a large number of electrical equipment manufacturers and from distributors and servicers of such equipment. The number and size of our competitors varies considerably by product line and service category, with many of our competitors tending to be small, highly specialized or focused on a certain geographic market area or customer. However, several of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources than us, including some of the world’s largest electrical products and industrial equipment manufacturing companies. A representative list of our competitors in our T&D Solutions segment includes ABB Ltd., Carte International, Inc., Eaton Corporation plc, General Electric Company, Schneider Electric SA, Hammond Power Solutions Inc., Howard Industries, Inc. and Partner Technologies, Inc. In the sale of onsite power systems and service, our Critical Power segment competes with larger, more established regional companies that represent Caterpillar, Cummins, Kohler and other generator manufacturers.
 
We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of technical support and application expertise, engineering, manufacturing and service capabilities, equipment rating, quality, scheduling and price. In all our businesses, our objective is to focus our efforts on more specialized, challenging and complex applications. Accordingly, a critical element to the success of our business is responsiveness and flexibility in providing custom-engineered solutions to satisfy customer needs. We believe that our strongest product niches are in the manufacture and design of small power and distribution electrical transformers, custom-manufactured panel board and switchboard products and in paralleling switchgear solutions for on-site power applications serving data centers, hospitals and other businesses with critical power needs. As a result of our long-time presence in the industry, we possess a number of special designs and libraries of programming code for our equipment that were engineered and developed specifically for our customers. We believe these factors give us a competitive advantage and that they are a major contributor to our frequency of repeat customer orders and the longevity of our customer relationships.
 
Raw Materials and Suppliers
 
The principal raw materials purchased by us are core steel, copper wire, aluminum strip, insulating materials including transformer oil and sheet metal. We also purchase certain electrical components from a variety of suppliers including bushings, switches, fuses, protectors and circuit breakers. These raw materials and components are available from and supplied by numerous sources at competitive prices, although there are more limited sources of supply for electrical core steel and transformer oil. Unanticipated increases in raw material prices or disruptions in supply could increase production costs and adversely affect our profitability. We attempt to minimize the effect on our profit margins of unanticipated changes in the prices of raw materials by including index clauses in our customer contracts that allow us to increase or reduce our prices if the costs of raw materials unexpectedly rise or decrease. Approximately 31% of our annual sales are made pursuant to contracts that contain such index clauses, which, subject to various formulae and limitations, permit us to adjust the final prices we charge. We do not anticipate any significant difficulty in satisfying our raw material requirements on reasonable terms and have not experienced any such difficulty in the past several years. Our largest suppliers during the year ended December 31, 2016 included Sumitomo Corporation, Generac, Essex Group, Metelec Ltée and Rea Magnet Wire Co. Inc. and our distribution transformer supplier from a low cost production location in Asia.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 415 employees consisting of 129 salaried staff and 286 hourly workers. Our hourly employees located at our plant in Farnham, Quebec, Canada are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with a provincial labor union that expires in March 2017. This agreement will not be renewed as we are planning to relocate our production from this facility to our lower cost facility in Reynosa Mexico. Our hourly employees located at our plant in Granby, Quebec, Canada are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the United Steel Workers of America Local 9414 that expires in May 2020. The hourly employees located at our manufacturing facility in Reynosa, Mexico are also covered by a collective bargaining agreement with a local labor union that has an indefinite term, subject to annual review and negotiation of key provisions. In addition, certain of our hourly employees located at our manufacturing facility in Santa Fe Springs, California are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Local Union 1710 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, AFL-CIO that expires in June 2019.
Environmental
 
We are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other areas, air emissions, discharges into waterways and the generation, handling, storing, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. These laws and regulations are constantly changing and it is impossible to predict with accuracy the effect they may have on us in the future. Like many other industrial enterprises, our manufacturing operations entail the risk of noncompliance, which may result in fines, penalties and remediation costs, and there can be no assurance that such costs will be insignificant. To our knowledge, we are in substantial compliance with all federal, state, provincial and local environmental protection provisions, and believe that the future compliance cost should not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, net income or competitive position. However, legal and regulatory requirements in these areas have been increasing and there can be no assurance that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the future due to regulatory noncompliance.
