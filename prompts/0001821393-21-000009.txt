ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the "Company," "our Company", "The Aaron's Company," "Aaron's," "we," "us," "our" and similar expressions are references to The Aaron’s Company, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, which holds, directly or indirectly, the assets and liabilities historically associated with the historical Aaron’s Business segment (the "Aaron’s Business") prior to the separation of the Aaron's Business segment from the Progressive Leasing and Vive segments further described below. 
Our Company
The Aaron's Company, Inc. is a leading, technology-enabled, omni-channel provider of lease-to-own ("LTO") and purchase solutions generally focused on serving the large, credit-challenged segment of the population. Through our portfolio of approximately 1,300 stores and our Aarons.com e-commerce platform, we provide consumers with LTO and purchase solutions for the products they need and want, including furniture, appliances, electronics, computers and a variety of other products and accessories. We focus on providing our customers with unparalleled customer service and an attractive value proposition, including competitive monthly payments and total cost of ownership, as compared to other LTO providers, high approval rates and lease term flexibility. In addition, we offer a wide product selection, free prompt delivery, product setup, service and returns, and the ability to pause, cancel or resume lease contracts at any time with no additional costs to the customer.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 1,092 Company-operated stores in 43 states and Canada, and 248 independently-owned franchised stores in 35 states and Canada.
Description of Spin-off Transaction
On October 16, 2020, management of Aaron’s, Inc. finalized the formation of a new holding company structure in anticipation of the separation and distribution transaction described below. Under the holding company structure, Aaron’s, Inc. became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of a newly formed company, Aaron’s Holdings Company, Inc. Aaron's, Inc. thereafter was converted to a limited liability company ("Aaron’s, LLC"). Upon completion of the holding company formation, Aaron’s Holdings Company, Inc. became the publicly traded parent company of the Progressive Leasing, Aaron’s Business, and Vive segments.
On November 30, 2020 (the "separation and distribution date"), Aaron's Holdings Company, Inc. completed the previously announced separation of the Aaron's Business segment from its Progressive Leasing and Vive segments and changed its name to PROG Holdings, Inc. (referred to herein as "PROG Holdings" or "Former Parent"). The separation of the Aaron's Business segment was effected through a distribution (the "separation", the "separation and distribution", or the "spin-off transaction") of all outstanding shares of common stock of a newly formed company called The Aaron's Company, Inc. ("Aaron's", "The Aaron's Company" or the "Company"), a Georgia corporation, to the PROG Holdings shareholders of record as of November 27, 2020. Upon the separation and distribution, Aaron's, LLC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Aaron's Company. Shareholders of PROG Holdings received one share of The Aaron's Company for every two shares of PROG Holdings common stock. Upon completion of the separation and distribution transaction, The Aaron's Company became an independent, publicly traded company under the ticker "AAN" on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"). References to PROG Holdings may refer to Aaron's, Inc. or Aaron's Holdings Company, Inc. for transactions, events, and obligations prior to the separation and distribution date or PROG Holdings, Inc. for transactions, events, and obligations of PROG Holdings at or subsequent to the separation and distribution date.
Strategic Plan
Our management team is committed to executing against the following core set of strategic priorities to further transform and grow the business:
•Promote our Value Proposition to Attract New Customers to our Brand – We continue to develop innovative marketing campaigns that better illustrate our value proposition to new, existing and previous Aaron’s customers. We utilize traditional and digital marketing communications aimed at educating our target customer about our key competitive advantages. Those advantages include competitive monthly payments and total cost of ownership, as compared to other LTO providers, high in-store approval rates and unparalleled customer service. In addition, we offer a wide product selection, free prompt delivery, product setup, service and returns, and the ability to pause, cancel or resume lease contracts at any time with no additional costs to the customer. We believe this value proposition, supported by our advanced omni-channel capabilities and existing store and supply chain infrastructure, differentiates us from competitors and will drive new customers to both our e-commerce and in-store channels.
•Enhance the Customer Experience Through Technology – We continue to provide an enhanced customer experience by developing and maintaining technologies that give the customer more control over the lease transaction. These technologies include data-enabled lease decisioning, fully transactional, on-line shopping, delivery management services and payment platforms that increase flexibility and customization for the customer. These initiatives are designed to provide our customers with the ability to transact, schedule deliveries, request service, and manage the payment process though their digital devices. We expect these initiatives to increase repeat business, reduce our customer acquisition cost, and improve the performance of our customer lease portfolio.
•Align our Store Footprint to our Customer Opportunity – We intend to reduce our 1,092 company-operated stores in existing markets by approximately 300 stores over the next 3 to 4 years. Through a strategic review of our real estate portfolio, we expect that we can increase profitability and continue to successfully serve our markets through a combination of (a) repositioning, remodeling and consolidating our existing stores and (b) utilizing our growing Aarons.com shopping and servicing platform. We expect that this strategy, together with our increased use of technology to better serve our customers, will enable us to reduce store count while retaining a significant portion of our existing customer relationships, as well as attracting new customers. Further, we believe there are opportunities to expand to new markets in the future. As part of the optimization of our store portfolio, we have successfully tested a new store concept, which features larger showrooms and/or re-engineered store layouts, increased product selection, technology-enabled shopping and checkout, and a refined operating model. 
•Maintain a Well-Capitalized Balance Sheet – As of December 31, 2020 we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $76.1 million with additional liquidity available through a $250.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility from which no amounts have been drawn. We expect to utilize a flexible capital structure and our low-leverage balance sheet to execute our strategies and deliver sustainable, long-term growth. In addition to balance sheet flexibility, we expect to generate strong excess cash flow that will allow the Company to fund its operations, pursue strategic acquisitions or other strategic relationships, and return capital to shareholders.
Competitive Assets
We have a unique set of physical and intangible assets developed over decades in the LTO business, which are difficult, expensive, and time consuming to replicate. We have developed a comprehensive strategy to leverage these assets including the following:
•Our brand and physical presence in approximately 700 markets – With over 65 years in business, the Company is recognized nationwide as a leader in the LTO marketplace. This brand recognition has led to an approximate 66% repeat customer rate for the new leases we enter into, and as of December 31, 2020, our company-operated and franchised stores had approximately 1.1 million customers with active leases. The versatility of our business model enables us to successfully serve diverse markets including rural, suburban and urban markets, helping mitigate the impact of local economic disruptions resulting from specific industry economic cycles, weather, and other disruptive events.
•Industry leading technology and analytics – The Company has invested in technology to improve the customer experience and its operational execution. These investments include platforms for enhanced data analytics, algorithm-led lease approval decisioning, digital customer onboarding, centralized payment processing and an e-commerce website that allows the customer to review and select merchandise where the customer desires to do so, complete the lease application and, if approved, complete the LTO agreement and make the first lease payment on-line. Our technology-enabled platforms simplify the transaction and provide customers with enhanced transparency and flexibility throughout their lease, and provide management with information needed to optimize the financial performance of the business.
•Management teams with deep industry experience and customer relationships – The Company's stores are managed by a group of tenured managers and multi-unit leaders who have deep knowledge of the LTO transaction and operations, as well as experience with our credit challenged customer base. Our high levels of customer service are enhanced by years of relationship building and LTO industry experience that is hard to replicate. Our average management tenure is as follows: 8 years for store managers; 10 years for regional managers; 15 years for divisional vice presidents; and 22 years for our Chief Store Operations Officer.
•Last-mile, reverse logistics and refurbishment capabilities – We have approximately 2,200 delivery trucks located throughout our network enabling us to provide last-mile and reverse logistics capabilities in our markets. All Aaron’s stores have a dedicated logistics team and infrastructure that enable us to offer our customers complimentary, prompt delivery, in-home set-up, product repair or replacement services, and reverse logistics for the products our customers obtain from us. Our stores also include refurbishment operations for returned merchandise, allowing us to provide pre-leased products for lease or sales in our stores and maximize inventory utilization.
•In-house upholstered furniture and bedding manufacturing – Under our Woodhaven Furniture Industries ("Woodhaven") manufacturing division, we have the capacity to manufacture approximately 1.5 million units per year of furniture and bedding, utilizing over 800,000 square feet of manufacturing capacity in two primary furniture facilities and seven mattress locations. In-house manufacturing provides control over quality and construction, fast response to changing customer tastes and market trends, reduced inventory fulfillment lead times, and mitigation of inventory supply disruptions.
Operating Segments
As of December 31, 2020, the Company has one operating and reportable segment ("Aaron's"), which is consistent with the current organizational structure and how the chief operating decision maker regularly reviews results to analyze performance and allocate resources. 
The operating results of our reportable segment may be found in (i) Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and (ii) Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
The Lease-to-Own Business Model
The LTO model offers customers an attractive alternative to traditional methods of purchasing home furnishings, electronics, appliances, computers and other consumer goods and accessories. In a standard LTO transaction, the customer has the option to acquire ownership of merchandise over a fixed term, usually 12 to 24 months, typically by making weekly, semi-monthly, or monthly lease payments. The customer also has the option to cancel the agreement at any time without penalty by returning the merchandise to the lessor and only making payments required for the accrued lease period. If the customer leases the item through the completion of the fixed term, they then obtain ownership of the item. In addition, LTO transactions typically include early ownership options, free delivery and in-home set-up of the merchandise, free repairs when needed, and other benefits.
An LTO agreement provides flexibility, an attractive upfront payment and no long-term commitment, and is available to all customers who qualify, including those who are credit challenged. Other consumers who find the LTO model appealing are those who have a temporary need for merchandise, those who want to try a product at home before committing to the full cost of ownership, and those who, despite access to credit, do not wish to incur additional debt. We believe the LTO value proposition results in high customer loyalty and repeat purchase behavior, which reduces customer acquisition costs and improves customer lifetime value.
LTO businesses benefit from relatively stable, recurring revenues and predictable cash flows provided by pools of lease agreements originated in prior periods. Our recurring revenue streams help insulate the business in times of macro-economic disruption and reduce reliance on current period sales and customer traffic for cash flows as compared to other retailing models. During the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 88% of the Company's total revenue was generated from recurring revenue streams related to our contracted lease payments.
Our Market Opportunity
Our core customer base is principally comprised of consumers in the United States and Canada with limited access to traditional credit sources. According to Fair Isaacs Corporation, more than 100 million people in the United States either have no credit score or have a score below 650. Historically, during economic downturns, our customer base expands due to tightened credit underwriting by banks and credit card issuers, as well as employment-related factors which may impact customers’ ability to otherwise purchase products from traditional retailers using cash or traditional financing sources. We have stores strategically located in approximately 700 markets across the United States and are within five miles of 38% of households. We have stores strategically located in 24 markets across Canada and are within five miles of 11% of households. Our stores are designed and merchandised to appeal to customers across different types of markets, including urban, suburban and rural markets.
Operations
Aaron's Store-based and Omni-channel Operations
As of December 31, 2020, we have stores located in 47 states and Canada, and our portfolio is comprised of 1,092 company-operated locations and 248 franchised locations, which are owned and operated by independent franchisees on a licensed basis. We have developed a distinctive store concept including specific merchandising standards, store designs, and flexible pricing terms, all designed to appeal to our customer base. Our typical store layout is a combination of showroom, customer service and warehouse space, generally comprising 6,000 to 15,000 square feet. Most stores have at least two trucks for prompt last-mile delivery, service and return of product.
We have developed an LTO industry-leading, omni-channel platform that allows Aaron’s to engage customers in ways that are convenient and preferable for them, including digitally streamlined shopping, servicing and payment options. One component of that omni-channel platform, our e-commerce website, Aarons.com, allows customers to seamlessly browse for merchandise, qualify for a lease, and complete the lease transaction. As a result of our technology-enabled omni-channel strategy, we are attracting more new and younger customers to our brand, with over half of the Aarons.com transactions throughout the year ended December 31, 2020 coming from individuals who previously had not shopped at Aaron’s.
We are committed to providing our customers with an exceptional in-store and on-line shopping experience. By leveraging our investments in technology, including Aarons.com, data-enabled lease decisioning, and our omni-channel customer service and payment platforms, we believe that we can serve our existing markets through a more efficient store portfolio while continuing to provide the high level of service our customers expect. We have identified a number of markets where we believe overall store counts can be meaningfully reduced and market economics improved. Concurrent with that optimization strategy, we have begun to roll-out a new store concept, which features larger showrooms and/or re-engineered and remodeled store layouts, an increased merchandise selection, technology-enabled shopping and checkout, and a refined operating model. 
With decades of customer lease performance data and recent advancements in analytics, we have developed a proprietary lease approval process with respect to our U.S. company-operated store customers. This process includes an algorithm-enabled, centralized digital decisioning platform, which is designed to improve our customer experience by streamlining and standardizing the lease decisioning process and shortening transaction times. Customers receive lease approval amounts either on-line or in our stores through a quick, convenient process that enables them to shop on Aarons.com or at one of our company-operated retail locations. We have partnered with our franchisees to begin implementing that centralized decisioning platform in our franchised stores as well. We expect the benefits of our enhanced lease decisioning process to result in better lease performance with fewer delinquencies or defaults.
Merchandising
We employ a merchandising strategy that spans three primary key product categories: furniture, home appliances and electronics. We have long-term relationships with many well-known and aspirational brands, including Samsung®, GE®, HP®, JBL®, Simmons®, Lane® and Ashley®. We purchase merchandise directly from manufacturers and local distributors at competitive prices. One of our largest suppliers is our own Woodhaven Furniture Industries manufacturing division, which supplies the majority of the bedding and a significant portion of the upholstered furniture we lease or sell. In recent years, we have strategically focused on growing the revenue contribution of furniture and appliances to align with macro-economic expansion in these categories and attract new customers. In addition, we have increased our product offerings through expanded aisle capabilities on Aarons.com and our in-store digital shopping platforms. 
The following table shows the percentage of our revenues attributable to different merchandise categories:

 | Year Ended December 31,
Aaron's Merchandise Category | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018
Furniture | 44 | % | | 44 | % | 44 | %
Home appliances | 29 | % | | 27 | % | 25 | %
Electronics | 24 | % | | 26 | % | 28 | %
Other | 3 | % | | 3 | % | 3 | %

Franchising
As of December 31, 2020, we had 72 franchisees, who operate a total of 248 franchised store locations. We have existing agreements with our current franchisees to govern the operations of franchised stores. Our standard agreement is for a term of ten years, with one ten-year renewal option, and requires our franchisees to operate in compliance with our policies and procedures. In collaboration with our franchisees, we are able to refine, further develop and test operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies that we believe will ultimately benefit our company-operated stores. Franchisees are obligated to remit to us royalty payments of 6% of the weekly cash revenue collections from their stores.
From time to time, we may enter into franchise agreements with new franchisees or purchase store locations from our franchisees. We have purchased 295 store locations from our franchisees since January 1, 2017. We have not entered into a franchise agreement with a new franchisee in more than five years. We will continue to assess opportunities to both acquire existing franchise locations and franchise new markets that we wish to develop.
Some qualifying franchisees took part in a financing arrangement we established with several financial institutions to assist our existing franchisees in establishing and operating their store(s). Under that arrangement, which was originally established in 1994, we provide guarantees to the financial institutions that provide the loan facilities for amounts outstanding under this franchise financing program. At December 31, 2020, the maximum amount that the Company would be obligated to repay in the event franchisees defaulted was $17.5 million, all of which would be due within the next two years. However, due to franchisee borrowing limits, we believe any losses associated with defaults would be substantially mitigated through recovery of lease merchandise and other assets. Since the inception of the franchise loan program in 1994, the Company's losses associated with the program have been immaterial. The Company believes that any future amounts to be funded by the Company in connection with these guarantees will be immaterial.
Manufacturing
Woodhaven Furniture Industries, our domestic manufacturing division, was established in 1982. Woodhaven consists of two furniture and seven bedding manufacturing facilities totaling approximately 800,000 square feet of manufacturing space. Our in-house manufacturing capabilities help to ensure that during periods of supply chain volatility, we are better positioned to provide our stores with suitable inventory to meet customer demand. Substantially all the items Woodhaven produces continue to be leased or sold through our stores, including franchised stores. However, we also manufacture and sell furniture products to other retailers.
Woodhaven produces upholstered living-room furniture (including contemporary sofas, chairs and modular sofa and ottoman collections in a variety of natural and synthetic fabrics) and bedding (including standard sizes of mattresses and box springs). The furniture produced by our integrated manufacturing operations incorporates features that we believe result in enhanced durability and improved shipping processes, as compared to furniture we would otherwise purchase from third parties. These features include (a) standardized components, (b) reduced number of parts and features susceptible to wear or damage, (c) more resilient foam, (d) durable fabrics and sturdy frames that translate to longer life and higher residual value, and (e) devices that allow sofas to stand on end for easier and more efficient transport. The division also provides replacement covers for all styles and fabrics of its upholstered furniture, as well as other parts, for use in reconditioning leased furniture that has been returned, so that our stores can continue to offer that furniture to our customers at a relatively lower price point. Furthermore, Woodhaven is also able to generate ancillary income and right-size production by selling furniture to third parties, including large, national retailers. During each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, approximately 16%, 8%, and 6%, respectively, of total non-retail sales, which we define as sales of new merchandise to our franchisees and to third-party retailers, were generated by Woodhaven from sales to third-party retailers.
Store Operations
We have various levels of leadership that oversee our business operations, including divisional vice presidents, area directors and regional managers. At the individual store level, the store manager is primarily responsible for managing and supervising all aspects of store operations, including (a) customer relations and account management, (b) deliveries and pickups, (c) warehouse and inventory management, (d) merchandise selection, (e) employment decisions, including hiring, training and terminating store employees, and (f) certain marketing initiatives. Store managers also administer the process of returning merchandise including making determinations with respect to inspection, product repair or replacement, sales, reconditioning and subsequent re-leasing.
Our business philosophy emphasizes the safeguarding of our assets, strict cost containment and financial controls. All personnel are expected to monitor expenses to contain costs. All material invoices are approved and paid utilizing our centralized corporate accounts payable process to enhance financial accountability. We believe that careful monitoring of lease merchandise as well as operational expenses enables us to maintain financial stability.
We use management information systems to facilitate customer orders, collections, merchandise returns and inventory monitoring. Each of our stores is network-linked directly to corporate headquarters enabling us to monitor single store performance on a daily basis. This network system assists the store manager in (a) tracking merchandise on the showroom floor and warehouse, (b) minimizing delivery times, (c) assisting with product purchasing, and (d) matching customer needs with available inventory.
Lease Agreement Approval, Renewal and Collection 
We have a proprietary lease approval process with respect to our U.S. company-operated store customers through our algorithm-enabled, centralized digital decisioning platform, which is designed to improve our customer experience by streamlining and standardizing the lease decisioning process and shortening transaction times. We have started implementing this centralized decisioning platform in our franchised stores as well. In addition to utilizing this decisioning platform, our stores may occasionally complete the lease approval process by verifying the applicant’s employment, or other reliable sources of income, and using personal references, which was the approval method used by our stores prior to the implementation of our centralized digital decisioning platform. Generally, our in-store and e-commerce lease agreements require payments in advance, and the merchandise normally is returned if a payment is significantly in arrears, and we have been unable to reach an alternative payment arrangement with the customer.
One of the factors in the success of our operations is timely collections, which are monitored by store managers and employees and our call center associates. Customers who miss payments are contacted within a few days after their lease payment renewal dates to discuss working with them to find a way to keep their agreement current. When we have been unable to reach the customer by telephone, we may visit those customers at their residences to encourage them to keep their agreement current and potentially return the lease merchandise. Careful attention to collections is particularly important in LTO operations, where the customer has the option to cancel the agreement at any time by returning the product covered by the agreement, and each contractually due payment is considered a renewal of the agreement. Approximately 86% of the payments that we collect are via a payment card, which reduces our transaction costs and increases our efficiency. We continue to encourage customers to take advantage of the convenience of enrolling in our automatic payment program, as approximately 46% of our customers had done as of December 31, 2020. In addition, we continue to emphasize collections-related compliance training, monitoring, and improvement initiatives, to ensure compliance with federal and state laws and regulations and our internal policies.
The provision for lease merchandise write-offs as a percentage of consolidated lease revenues was 4.2%, 6.2% and 4.6% in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We believe that our collection and recovery policies comply with applicable laws, and we discipline any employee we determine to have deviated from such policies.
Customer Service
We believe our strong focus on customer satisfaction generates repeat business and long-lasting relationships with our customers. Our customers receive multiple complimentary service benefits. These benefits vary according to applicable state law but generally include early purchase options, free relocation of product to a new address within a specified geographic area, reinstatement options, product repair or replacement, and other discounts and benefits. To increase leasing transactions, we foster relationships with our existing customers to attract recurring business, and many new agreements are attributable to repeat customers. During the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 66% of the new lease agreements we entered into were with repeat customers. 
Our store-based operations offer customers the option to obtain a membership in the Aaron’s Club Program (the "Club Program"). The benefits to customers of the Club Program are separated into three general categories: (a) product protection benefits; (b) health & wellness discounts; and (c) dining, shopping and consumer savings.
The product protection benefits provide Club Program members with lease payment waivers for up to four months or a maximum of $1,000 on active customer lease agreements if the customer becomes unemployed or ill; replacement of the product if the product is stolen or damaged by an act of God; waiver of remaining lease payments on lease agreements where any member named on the lease agreement dies; and/or product repair or replacement for an extended period after the customer takes ownership. 
Our emphasis on customer service at our store-based operations requires that we develop skilled, effective employees who value our customers and who possess and project a genuine desire to serve our customers’ needs. To meet this requirement, we have created and implemented a comprehensive associate development program for both new and tenured associates.
Our associate development program is designed to train our associates to provide a compliant, consistent and enhanced customer service experience, which is described in further detail within the "Human Capital Management" section below. 
Distribution for our Store-based Operations
Our store-based operations utilize our 16 fulfillment centers to control merchandise and offer our customers a wide product assortment. These centers average approximately 124,000 square feet, giving us approximately 2.0 million square feet of logistics capacity outside of our network of stores.
We believe that our network of fulfillment centers provide a strategic advantage over our competitors. Our distribution system allows us to deliver merchandise promptly to our stores to quickly meet customer demand and effectively manage inventory levels. Most of our contiguous U.S. stores are within a 250-mile radius of a fulfillment center, facilitating timely shipment of products to the stores and fast delivery of orders to customers.
We realize freight savings from bulk discounts and more efficient distribution of merchandise by using fulfillment centers. We use our own tractor-trailers, local delivery trucks and various contract carriers to make weekly deliveries to individual stores.
Marketing and Advertising
Our marketing efforts target potential new customers, as well as current and previous customers, through a variety of traditional and digital media channels including on-line search, TV, radio, digital video, and direct mail, with a combination of brand and promotional messaging. We continue to test new ways to engage potential customers and identify audience segments that find the LTO solution appealing.
With our fast-growing e-commerce business, we focus heavily on digital marketing including search, display, and social media to help drive traffic to both stores and our e-commerce website. Our e-commerce marketing is dynamically managed on a daily basis and is growing as a share of spend relative to traditional marketing channels.
We continue to refine and expand our overall contact strategy to grow our customer base. We test various types of advertising and marketing campaigns and strategies, analyze the results of those tests and, based on our learnings, refine those campaigns and strategies to attempt to maximize their effectiveness with current and potential customers. By understanding optimal offers and products to promote to current and former customers, along with potential prospects, we look to continue improvements in marketing return on investment. With respect to existing customers, direct mail and email serve as the primary tools we utilize in our marketing strategies. With respect to marketing to potential customers, our primary tools currently include digital, direct mail, and traditional broadcasting and search advertising.
Human Capital Management
At December 31, 2020, we had approximately 9,400 full-time and part time team members, the majority of which were full time team members. Approximately 7,800 of our team members are store or divisional/regional staff, with the remainder being part of store support, fulfillment center, service center and Woodhaven employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our relations with employees are good.
Diversity and Inclusivity
We believe in being an inclusive workplace for all of our employees and are committed to having a diverse workforce that is representative of the customers that choose to shop with us in-store or online and the communities in which we operate our businesses. A variety of perspectives enriches our culture, leads to innovative solutions for our business and enables us to better meet the needs of a diverse customer base and reflects the communities we serve. Our aim is to develop inclusive leaders and an inclusive culture, while also recruiting, developing, mentoring, training, and retaining a diverse workforce, including a diverse group of management-level employees. Our diversity and inclusion initiatives include:
•Providing executive, monetary and other support to our Employee Business Resource Groups ("EBRG") which provide educational and motivational events and mentorship experiences for our employees and support the Company’s objectives related to developing associates and creating diversity awareness, which include the Aaron’s Black Leadership Exchange, Aaron’s Women’s Leadership Network, Inspiring Growth and Unity at Aaron's for Latinos/Hispanics, and Pride Alliance;
•Establishing the Aaron’s Diversity and Inclusion Council to provide management support and oversight to our EBRGs, which includes leaders from multiple functional areas, including human resources, talent acquisition and onboarding, learning and development, total rewards (i.e., compensation and benefits), procurement, legal, store and executive leadership;
•Developing unconscious bias training for employees across the Company; and
•Implementing a talent review process designed to utilize a multi-factor approach to understanding the talents of our employees and the potential they have to be future Company leaders.
Development
We believe in offering career opportunities, resources, programs and tools to help employees grow and develop, as well as competitive wages and benefits. Our efforts in these areas include:
•Offering platforms, including our learning and development portal and other on-line and in-person professional growth and development training, to help employees develop their skills and grow their careers at the Company, including a third-party learning platform that offers over 16,000 courses to all management and store support center team members;
•Providing management development training to all of our management-level employees in 2020, including compliance, ethics and leadership training;
•Providing employees with recurring training on critical issues such as safety and security, compliance, ethics and integrity, and information security;
•Gathering engagement feedback from our employees on a regular basis and responding to that feedback in a variety of ways, including personal, one-on-one interactions, team meetings, leadership communications, and senior executive-led town hall meetings with employees;
•Offering a tuition reimbursement program that provides eligible employees up to $1,500 per year for courses related to current or future roles at the Company;
•Offering health benefits for all eligible employees, including our eligible hourly call-center, store-based and fulfillment center employees; 
•Providing confidential counseling for employees through our employee assistance program;
•Providing paid parental leave – maternity, paternity and adoption;
•Providing paid time off; and
•Matching employees’ 401(k) plan contributions on up to 5% of eligible pay after one year of service; and offering an employee stock purchase program for eligible employees.
Health and Safety
Aaron’s takes the safety of our team members and our customers seriously. Aaron’s policies and training programs support our health and safety practices. Throughout the year, team members complete compliance training relevant to their role. Completion of required compliance training is closely managed to ensure that team members have the required skills and knowledge to perform ethically and safely. Additional protocols were implemented in 2020 designed to protect the health and safety of our team members and customers, in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic related to the novel coronavirus disease ("COVID-19"), including protocols and policies for wearing personal protective equipment such as masks, social distancing, enhanced cleaning and sanitation, and managing the flow of traffic within our stores and other facilities. Additionally, beginning in mid-March 2020, we transitioned associates whose job duties allow them to do so to work remotely from home for the foreseeable future.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive market with competition from national, regional and local operators of direct-to-consumer LTO stores and websites, virtual LTO companies, traditional and e-commerce retailers (including many that offer layaway programs, point of sale financing, and title or installment lending), traditional and on-line sellers of used merchandise, and various types of consumer finance companies that may enable our customers to shop at traditional or on-line retailers, as well as with rental stores that do not offer their customers a purchase option. We also compete with retail stores for customers desiring to purchase merchandise for cash or on credit. Competition is based primarily on product selection and availability, customer service, payment amounts, store location and terms, as well as total cost of merchandise ownership, the number and frequency of lease payments, and other factors.
Working Capital
Our LTO model results in us remaining the owner of merchandise on lease; therefore, our most significant working capital asset is merchandise inventory on lease. Our store-based and e-commerce operations also require us to maintain significant levels of merchandise inventory available for lease to provide the service levels demanded by our customers and to ensure timely delivery of our products. Consistent and dependable sources of liquidity are required to maintain such merchandise levels. We believe our cash on hand, operating cash flows, and availability under our credit agreement is adequate to meet our normal liquidity requirements.
Raw Materials
The principal raw materials we use in furniture manufacturing at Woodhaven are fabric, foam, fiber, wire-innerspring assemblies, plywood, oriented strand board and hardwood. All of these materials are purchased in the open market from unaffiliated sources. We have a diverse base of suppliers; therefore, we are not dependent on any single supplier. The sourcing of raw materials from our suppliers is not overly dependent on any particular country. While we have not had any material interruptions in our manufacturing operations due to COVID-19 pandemic-related shortages of raw materials, there can be no assurances that disruptions to our supply of raw materials will not become more significant going forward due to the adverse impacts of the pandemic.
Seasonality
Our revenue mix is moderately seasonal. Adjusting for growth, the first quarter of each year generally has higher revenues than any other quarter. This is primarily due to realizing the full benefit of business that historically gradually increases in the fourth quarter as a result of the holiday season, as well as the receipt by our customers in the first quarter of federal and state income tax refunds. Our customers will more frequently exercise the early purchase option on their existing lease agreements or purchase merchandise off the showroom floor during the first quarter of the year. We expect these trends to continue in future periods.
Due to the seasonality of our business and the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during the year ended December 31, 2020, including the impacts of current and/or future governmental assistance or stimulus, results for any quarter or period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.
Government Regulation
Our operations are extensively regulated by and subject to the requirements of various federal, state and local laws and regulations, and are subject to oversight by various government agencies. In general, such laws regulate applications for leases, pricing, late charges and other fees, lease disclosures, the content of advertising materials, and certain collection procedures.
Violations of certain provisions of these laws may result in material penalties. We are unable to predict the nature or effect on our operations or earnings of unknown future legislation, regulations and judicial decisions or future interpretations of existing and future legislation or regulations relating to our operations, and there can be no assurance that future laws, decisions or interpretations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
At the present time, no federal law specifically regulates the LTO transaction. Federal legislation to regulate the transaction has been proposed from time to time. In addition, certain elements of the business including matters such as collections activity, marketing disclosures to customers and customer contact may be subject to federal laws and regulation.
There has been increased legislative and regulatory attention in the United States, at both the federal and state levels, on financial services products offered to near-prime and subprime consumers in general, which may result in an increase in legislative regulatory efforts directed at the LTO industry. We cannot predict whether any such legislation or regulations will be enacted and what the impact would be on us.
Additional regulations are being developed, as the attention placed on financial services products and consumer debt transactions, including consumer debt collection practices, has grown significantly. We believe we are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Although we are unable to predict the results of any regulatory initiatives, we do not believe that existing and currently proposed regulations will have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
Federal regulatory authorities are increasingly focused on the subprime financial marketplace in which the LTO industry operates, and any of these agencies may propose and adopt new regulations, or interpret existing regulations, in a manner that could result in significant adverse changes in the regulatory landscape for businesses such as ours. In addition, with increasing frequency, federal and state regulators are holding businesses like ours to higher standards of training, monitoring and compliance.
From time to time, federal regulatory agencies and state attorneys general have directed investigations or regulatory initiatives toward our industry, or toward certain companies within the industry.
In addition to federal regulatory oversight, currently, nearly every state and most provinces in Canada specifically regulate LTO transactions via state or provincial statutes, including states in which we currently operate our stores. Most state LTO laws require LTO companies to disclose to their customers the total number of payments, total amount and timing of all payments to acquire ownership of any item, any other charges that may be imposed and miscellaneous other items. The more restrictive state LTO laws limit the retail price for an item, the total amount that a customer may be charged for an item, or regulate the "cost-of-rental" amount that LTO companies may charge on LTO transactions, generally defining "cost-of-rental" as lease fees paid in excess of the "retail" price of the goods. Our long-established policy in all states is to disclose the terms of our LTO transactions as a matter of good business ethics and customer service. We believe we are in material compliance with the various state LTO laws.
Supply Chain Diligence and Transparency
Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act was adopted to further the humanitarian goal of ending the violent conflict and human rights abuses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries ("DRC"). This conflict has been partially financed by the exploitation and trade of tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold, often referred to as conflict minerals, which originate from mines or smelters in the region. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act require reporting companies to disclose annually, among other things, whether any such minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products they manufactured during the prior calendar year originated in the DRC and, if so, whether the related revenues were used to support the conflict and/or abuses. 
Some of the products manufactured by Woodhaven Furniture Industries, our manufacturing division, may contain tantalum, tin, tungsten and/or gold. Consequently, in compliance with SEC rules, we have adopted a policy on conflict minerals, which can be found on our website at investor.aarons.com. We have also implemented a supply chain due diligence and risk mitigation process with reference to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, or the OECD, guidance approved by the SEC to assess and report annually whether our products are conflict free.
We expect our suppliers to comply with the OECD guidance and industry standards and to ensure that their supply chains conform to our policy and the OECD guidance. We plan to mitigate identified risks by working with our suppliers and may alter our sources of supply or modify our product design if circumstances require.
