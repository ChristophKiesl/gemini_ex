Item 1.  Business
The Company

Graybar is a leading North American distributor of electrical and communications and data networking products and is a provider of related supply chain management and logistics services. We primarily serve customers in the construction, commercial, institutional and government ("CIG"), and industrial & utility vertical markets ("vertical" or "verticals"), with products and services that support new construction, infrastructure updates, building renovation, facility maintenance, repair and operations ("MRO"), and original equipment manufacturers ("OEM").

Through a network of 292 locations across the United States and Canada, we serve approximately 146,000 customers. Our business is primarily based in the United States ("U.S."). We also have subsidiary operations with distribution facilities in Canada and Puerto Rico.

We distribute over one million products purchased from approximately 4,200 manufacturers and suppliers. We purchase all of the products we sell from others, and we neither manufacture nor contract to manufacture any products we sell.

We generally finance our inventory through the collection of trade receivables and trade accounts payable terms with our suppliers.  We use short-term borrowing facilities to finance inventory purchases and other operating expenses when necessary, and we have not historically used long-term borrowings for this purpose.




In addition to our extensive product offering, we provide a wide range of supply chain management services that when combined with our network of locations are designed to deliver convenience, cost savings and improved efficiency for our customers.

We were incorporated in 1925 under the laws of the State of New York. Our active and retired employees own 100% of our common stock. There is no public trading market for our common stock.

Competition

Our industry is comprised of thousands of local and regional distributors, along with several large national and global distributors. Graybar is among the largest distributors of electrical and communications and data networking products to the construction, CIG, and industrial & utility verticals in North America. Our industry is highly competitive, and we estimate that the top five distributors account for approximately 35% of the total U.S. market. Some of our largest competitors have greater global geographic scope, which may provide them an advantage, particularly with certain multi-national customers.

Our industry is influenced by economic and regulatory factors that impact rates of new construction, as well as customers' or end users' decisions to invest in renovation and expansion of facilities and infrastructure. The industry is also affected by changes in technology, both in the products that are typically sold through distribution and in the ways customers choose to transact business with distributors. Driven by customers' omnichannel buying preferences and their desire to increase efficiency and productivity, digitalization is becoming increasingly important to both manufacturers and distributors in our industry.

Our pricing reflects the value associated with the products and services that we provide. We consider our prices to be generally competitive. We believe that, while price is an important customer consideration, the services we provide distinguish us from many of our competitors, whether they are distributors or manufacturers selling directly to our customer base.  We view our ability to quickly supply our customers with a broad range of products through conveniently located distribution facilities as a competitive advantage that customers value.  However, if a customer is not looking for one distributor to provide a wide range of products and does not require prompt delivery or other services, a competitor that does not provide this level of service may be in a position to offer lower prices.

Markets Served

Graybar serves a wide range of customers within certain primary verticals. The largest of these verticals is construction, which accounted for more than half of our sales in 2020. Customers within this vertical include various types of contractors and installers that perform new construction and renovation of commercial and industrial facilities and utility infrastructure.

The other verticals we serve are CIG and industrial & utility. The CIG vertical includes a broad range of commercial office, warehouse, and retail facilities, federal, state, and local governmental agencies, and the education and health care sectors. The industrial & utility vertical includes customers and products for MRO, OEM, broadband utility and electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure. 

Products and Suppliers

We distribute over one million products purchased from approximately 4,200 manufacturers and suppliers. Approximately 110,000 of these products are stocked in our warehouses, allowing us in most cases to provide customers with convenient, local access to the items they need every day. When the specialized nature or size of a particular shipment warrants, we arrange to ship products directly from our suppliers; otherwise, orders are filled from our own on-hand inventory. On a dollar volume basis, we filled approximately 60% of customer orders from this on-hand inventory in 2020 and 2019.

 


Approximately 50% of the products we sold during 2020 were purchased from our top 25 suppliers.  However, we generally have the ability to purchase from more than one supplier for any product type, which allows us to offer alternative sources of comparable products for nearly all products. The products we distribute can be generally identified as follows:



• Building and Industrial Wire and Cable | • Fittings 
• LED Fixtures | • Fluorescent Lighting 
• Distribution Equipment | • Wiring Devices 
• Telecommunications Material | • Fasteners 
• Communication Wire and Cable | • Enclosures 
• Conduit and Tray | • LED, Incandescent and Fluorescent Lamps 
• Data Connectivity | • Electronic Equipment 
• Automation and Controls | • Miscellaneous MRO Products 
• Data Cables and Data Cords | 


These products may be sold into any of the verticals we target, depending on a customer's or end user's needs. Our salesforce is empowered to sell any of these products or related services to any customer, in some cases with the support of specialists who are trained in specific industries and/or new technologies.

Maintaining strong relationships with our suppliers is important to our business, and we enjoy longstanding relationships with several of our suppliers (or their predecessors). However, most of our supplier agreements are nonexclusive national or regional distributorships, terminable upon 30 to 90 days' notice by either party.

Sales and Distribution

We sell products and services manufactured or provided by others primarily through a network of sales offices and distribution facilities located throughout the U.S. We operate multiple distribution facilities in each district, each of which carries an inventory of products and operates as a wholesale distributor for the territory in which it is located.  Some districts have sales offices that do not carry inventory. In addition, we have twenty regional distribution centers containing inventories of both standard and specialized products.  The regional distribution centers replenish inventories carried at our other U.S. distribution facilities and make shipments directly to customers.  We also have subsidiary operations with distribution facilities located in the U.S. and Canada and a single distribution facility in Puerto Rico.
Human Capital

At December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 8,200 people on a full-time basis, of which approximately 4,100 people were in sales capacities. Approximately 1% of our employees were covered by union contracts.  We have not had a material work stoppage and consider our relations with our employees to be good.
