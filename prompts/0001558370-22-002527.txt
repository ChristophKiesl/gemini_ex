ITEM 1.              BUSINESS
Our Business
We are one of the largest asset-based truckload carriers in the United States by revenue, generating over $1.9 billion in total operating revenue in 2021. We provide services primarily throughout the United States, with a focus in the densely populated and economically diverse eastern half of the United States. We offer customers a broad portfolio of services using our own truckload fleet and third-party carriers through our non-asset-based truck brokerage network. As of December 31, 2021, our fleet consisted of approximately 6,400 tractors and approximately 13,600 trailers, including approximately 1,200 tractors provided by independent contractors. Our terminal network is established and capable of handling significantly larger volumes without meaningful additional investment. 

For much of our history, we focused primarily on scaling our fleet and expanding our service offerings to support sustainable, multi-faceted relationships with customers. More recently, we have focused on our core service offerings and refined our network to focus on shorter, more profitable lanes with more density, which we believe are more attractive to drivers. We believe we have the strategy, management team, revenue base, modern fleet, and capital structure that position us very well to execute upon our initiatives, drive further operational gains, and deliver long term value for our stockholders. 
We are currently focused on three main priorities. The first is optimizing our Truckload network and resulting average revenue per tractor per week through repositioning equipment and allocating capacity to our Dedicated service offering and Variant, our digital fleet, from certain portions of our Over-the-Road (“OTR”) service offering. The second is improving the experience of our professional truck drivers, including their safety and security. The third is advancing our technology initiatives centered on digitization of our loads and business, automated load acceptance and prioritization. During 2021, we continued to see tangible, financial benefits of our strategic initiatives focused on utilizing technology to improve our processes, accelerate the velocity of our business, reduce the number of our preventable accidents, improve our customers’ and drivers’ satisfaction, and lower our costs.
We intend to continue successfully developing and implementing these digital initiatives that we believe are re-engineering our Company to be a market leader in growth and profitability over the next decade. We believe the result of these initiatives will provide for a more scalable model with significantly lower costs.
Our Service Offerings
We organize our service offerings into two reportable segments, Truckload and Brokerage. The Truckload segment offers asset-based truckload services, including the OTR and dedicated contract services described below. Our Brokerage segment is principally engaged in non-asset-based freight brokerage services. We believe many customers seek truckload operators that offer both asset-based and non-asset-based services to help ensure capacity will be available as needed. We believe that each of our service offerings, on a stand-alone revenue basis, would represent one of the largest participants in its respective market.

----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We primarily operate in the eastern half of the United States. We also have business to and from Mexico via a more variable cost model using third party carriers. The revenue from such model is generated in the United States. During 2021 and 2020, all of our operating revenue was generated in the United States. 
Customer Relationships
We maintain a diverse, long-standing customer base that includes many Fortune 500 companies, including Dollar General, Dollar Tree, FedEx, Home Depot, Kroger, Procter & Gamble, Target, Tractor Supply and Walmart. Our customers fall within a broad spectrum of geographies and end markets, including retail, food and beverage, e-commerce and packages, manufacturing, consumer products and third-party logistics. No other category comprised more than five percent of the end markets we served at December 31, 2021. Relationships with our top ten customers exceed ten years on average. For 

Page 5




the year ended December 31, 2021, our largest customer accounted for approximately 11% of our revenue, excluding fuel surcharge.
Tractor and Trailer Fleets
We operate a modern fleet of approximately 5,200 company-owned tractors and approximately 13,600 trailers, and we also contract for additional tractor capacity through approximately 1,200 independent contractors, who provide both the tractor and a driver and, except for the trailer, which we generally provide, bear the operating expenses of each load. Our company tractor fleet continues to include the most advanced technology in today’s market including electronic logging devices (“ELDs”), electronic speed limiters, electronic roll stability, improved aerodynamics and fuel efficiency technologies, enhanced tractor connectivity with remote updating capabilities, improved automatic transmissions, lane departure and collision warning / avoidance systems, upgraded braking systems and event recorders. Each of our company tractors is also equipped with onboard communication units that offer real time freight positioning to our customers and instant communication between our drivers and us.
Tractors and trailers represent our most substantial capital investments. In general, we expect to operate a tractor for approximately 475,000 to 575,000 miles, which when averaged across our fleet as of December 31, 2021 equates to approximately 4.5 years of operation and a trailer for up to 10 years or more of operation. We depreciate or finance our equipment over their useful lives and down to salvage values that we expect to represent fair market value at the expected time of sale. Our ongoing capital expenditures are significant, and our annual depreciation expense is expected to be approximately equal to maintenance capital expenditures, net of proceeds of dispositions, assuming a constant percentage of leased versus owned equipment and a constant trade cycle. In practice, we vary our trade cycle and financing based on the market for new and used tractors, the quality, dependability and cost per mile to operate the equipment, our capital budget, expected tax benefits and other factors. Based on the volumes we purchase, we believe that we have a cost advantage in the procurement of new tractors and trailers compared to the prices paid by small trucking companies.
Our company tractors had an average age of approximately 1.7 years at December 31, 2021. 
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following competitive strengths provide us with a strong foundation to continue to improve our profitability and stockholder value:
Industry leading truckload operator with significant scale
We are one of the largest asset-based truckload carriers in the United States in 2021 by total operating revenue and we believe our large scale provides us with significant benefits. These benefits include economies of scale on major expenditures such as tractors, trailers and fuel, as well as our overall infrastructure. Additionally, we can offer an enhanced value proposition for large customers who seek efficiency in sourcing capacity from a limited number of carriers and flexible capacity to accommodate seasonal surge volumes. Our established and well-maintained terminal network is capable of handling meaningfully larger volumes without meaningful additional investment.
Complementary mix of services to afford flexibility and stability throughout economic cycles
Our service offerings have unique characteristics and are subject to differing market forces, which we believe allows us to respond effectively through economic cycles.
OTR
OTR business involves short-term customer contracts without pricing or volume guarantees that allow us to benefit from periods of supply and demand imbalance and price volatility. This is the largest part of our business and the overall truckload market.
Dedicated
Dedicated business features committed rates, lanes and volumes under contracts that generally afford us greater revenue predictability over the contract period and help smooth the impact of market cycles. Additionally, our dedicated contract 

Page 6




service offering generally has higher driver retention rates than our OTR service offering, which we believe is because our professional drivers prefer the more predictable time at home that dedicated routes offer. In addition, this increased visibility allows us to commit and invest fleet resources with a more predictable return profile. We intend to grow this portion of our business as a percentage of our average tractors.
Brokerage
Brokerage capacity allows us to aggregate volume and to flex the amount allocated to our own fleet with freight cycles. Typically, we allocate more loads to our OTR fleet during slow freight demand to keep our assets productive, and more loads to third-party carriers during higher freight demand to maintain control over customer freight and make a margin on outsourcing the moves. By retaining control over significantly more freight than we are able to serve with our own assets, and allocating the available loads first to our own tractors, we have more choices for optimizing the utilization and pricing of our fleet every day and throughout market cycles. 
Technology
We are focused on continual development and implementation of the digital initiatives that we believe are re-engineering our company to be a market leader in growth and profitability over the next decade. Within our Truckload reportable segment, Variant represents an entirely new paradigm for operating trucks in an Over-the-Road environment utilizing artificial intelligence and digital platforms to recruit, plan, dispatch and manage its fleet. The division’s operating model, powered by cutting edge technology, has generated improvement in utilization while significantly reducing driver turnover, and preventable accidents per million miles, all as compared to our legacy OTR fleet. During the second half of 2021, Variant’s turnover, utilization, and revenue per tractor per week began to deteriorate and those trends accelerated in the fourth quarter. In December 2021, the Variant team began to transition its focus from idea generation to execution and scale the product that was developed. Since December 2021, the operational changes that we have made have translated to improvements in utilization, revenue per truck and overhead per truck. 
​
During 2020, we purchased a small business with a technology platform and an experienced and talented team. Their approach to the brokerage business is to utilize a digital framework for handling transactions which we expect to be scalable. Importantly, we believe this platform will enable our team to continue scaling the business and drive a high level of growth in the years to come. Our team processed 76.7% of our Brokerage transactions digitally in 2021. As we drive more volume over our digital platform, we believe our Brokerage segment will become much more scalable and allow us to profitably drive growth as we look to the years ahead.
​
Long-standing, diverse and resilient customer base
We maintain a long-standing customer base that includes many Fortune 500 companies with national footprints, including Dollar General, Dollar Tree, FedEx, Home Depot, Kroger, Procter & Gamble, Target, Tractor Supply and Walmart. As of December 31, 2021, relationships with our top ten customers exceeded ten years on average. Our portfolio of blue-chip customers allows us to benefit from the less cyclical and more-stable demand from grocery and dollar stores in addition to increasing demand due to secular growth trends in end-markets such as e-commerce. We also benefit from significant cross-selling opportunities among large key customers, as all of our top ten customers use at least two of our three service offerings, which allows us to have multiple points of contact with our customers and take advantage of varying bid cycles.
Modern fleet and maintenance system designed to optimize life cycle investment and minimize operating costs
Our fleet represents our largest capital investment, a visible representation of our brand for customers and drivers and a large portion of our controllable costs. We select, maintain and dispose of our fleet based on rigorous analysis of our investments and operating costs.
Our modern and well-maintained fleet consisted of approximately 5,200 company tractors with an average age of approximately 1.7 years and approximately 13,600 trailers at December 31, 2021. We also contracted for approximately 1,200 tractors provided by independent contractors at December 31, 2021. We equip our tractors with carefully selected components based on initial cost, maintenance requirements, warranty coverage, safety and efficiency advantages, driver preference and resale value. Our company tractor fleet is technologically advanced and equipped with safety and efficiency features, including using electronic logs since 2012, electronic speed limiters, automatic transmissions, lane departure and 

Page 7




collision warning systems, air disc brakes and high performance wide brake drums, electronic roll stability and event recorders. 
Over the past several years, we have developed a disciplined and effective in-house maintenance program designed to actively manage these assets based on customized timetables for preventive maintenance and replacement of parts. We believe this approach, coupled with our in-house maintenance facilities and in-house technicians dedicated to fleet maintenance, helps us effectively manage our maintenance cost per mile, keeps drivers on the road efficiently and creates an attractive asset and record for resale.
Motivated management team focused on tactical execution and leadership in the truckload market
Our management and operations team has been carefully assembled to obtain a mix of industry veterans from successful competitors and high-performing internal candidates, all of whom are motivated to perform in our transparent, metric-driven environment. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, Eric Fuller, has over 20 years of experience at U.S. Xpress and has been responsible for developing the team and spearheading our transformation program over the last several years. Our management team’s compensation and ownership of our common stock provide further incentive to improve business performance and profitability. In addition, with active positions in industry associations, such as the American Trucking Associations, Inc. (“ATA”), our management team provides us with a key role in the discussions that we believe are shaping the future of the industry. We believe our leadership team is well-positioned to execute our strategy and remains a key driver of our financial and operational success.
Our Strategies

Independent Contractors
In addition to the company drivers that we employ, we enter into contracts with independent contractors. Independent contractors operate their own tractors (although some employ drivers they hire) and provide their services to us under contractual arrangements. Except for generally providing independent contractors with the use of our trailers, they are responsible for the ownership and operating expenses and are compensated by us primarily on a rate per mile basis. By operating safely and productively, independent contractors can improve their own profitability and ours. We believe that the fleet of independent contractors we engage provides significant advantages that primarily arise from the motivation of business ownership. Independent contractors tend to produce more miles per tractor per week. As of December 31, 2021, the approximately 1,200 independent contractors we engage comprised approximately 17% of our available capacity, as measured by tractor count.
Services offered to independent contractors include insurance, maintenance and fuel. Through our wholly owned insurance captive subsidiary, Xpress Assurance, Inc. (“Xpress Assurance”), independent contractors can purchase occupational accident, physical damage and other types of insurance. Independent contractors also are able to procure at their expense fuel and maintenance services at our truckload service centers.
Human Capital Resources
General
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 8,689 employees, of whom approximately 5,952 were drivers, approximately 321 were maintenance technicians and approximately 2,416 were office employees, including operations staff, sales and marketing, recruiting, safety and other support personnel. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 
To attract and retain the best-qualified talent, we offer competitive benefits, including market-competitive compensation, healthcare, paid time off, 401(k), employee stock purchase, tuition assistance, employee skills development and leadership development. 
​
Professional truck drivers are the backbone of our success and the heart of the Company. Responsibility for driver retention flows throughout our organization and every office and maintenance employee is expected to take the necessary steps to keep our drivers satisfied and productive. Keeping our drivers satisfied and safe is the guiding principle behind our modern fleet, training programs and driver compensation. We continue to focus on driver centric initiatives such as increased miles and modern equipment, to both retain the professional drivers who have chosen to partner with us and attract new professional drivers to our team. 
Corporate Culture & Diversity
​
We recruit, develop, and retain diverse talent.  This strategy is paying huge dividends – not only for the organization, but for our employees. To foster their and our joint success, we seek to create an environment where people can do their best 

Page 9




work—a place where they can proudly be their authentic selves, and where they know their needs can be met. Over the past several years we have committed to providing increased transparency on our inclusion and diversity commitments and are making progress in applying and advancing inclusiveness and diversity practices across our workplace.
Workforce culture is key to successfully achieving our operational objectives. In an industry that changes rapidly and as part of our intentional efforts to lead digital transformation throughout the organization, we understand ongoing training and development is needed for all employees. To address these evolving needs, we fill skill gaps through talent acquisition and through numerous training programs for our employees such as Leadership Excellence at the Peak, Leadership Excellence Fundamentals for new managers, Leadership Excellence Relationomics, Digital Communities of Practice, Digital Upskilling, access to over 4,000 courses through our learning management system. For our drivers we have re-envisioned our driver training program and developed and launched our new Professional Driver Onboarding Program in 2021.
We aspire to the highest standards of inclusiveness, diversity and equity. During 2021, we continued to focus on inclusion as we partnered with Wade Hinton as our Chief Inclusion Partner to conduct a detailed assessment of our inclusion and diversity efforts and develop a best-in-class strategy focused on culture of place and inclusion for the future.  We launched our self-identify survey to assist in making decisions from an inclusion and diversity standpoint.  We launched three Employee Resource Groups (“ERG”), Women’s ERG, Multi-Cultural ERG and Veteran’s ERG with great participation from our employees.  We have a strong commitment to creating a culture where everyone is included and respected. We are committed to diverse representation across all levels of the workforce while working to find the most qualified candidate for every position. We believe our differences make us stronger as a team, and it is through creating an environment that maximizes each individual’s contributions, intentional focus on our cultural goals, and continuous training and development that we and our employees succeed. 
Safety
We are committed to pursue safety as one of our core cultural values. Our drivers are subject to certain hiring guidelines related to driving history, accident and safety history, physical standards and drug and alcohol testing. Upon meeting certain criteria, applicants are invited to attend an orientation at one of our service centers. The on-site orientation is focused on introducing a driver to the concepts and training necessary to be a successful, professional driver, including training related to safety, life on the road, our operations and equipment and electronic log operation. The on-site orientation also includes a road test. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have leveraged our new driver training program as well as created a virtual orientation program that allows new drivers to complete work remotely and, therefore, avoiding a majority of classroom work.
​
In addition to our hiring criteria, our tractors are equipped with electronic speed limiters, automatic transmissions, lane departure and collision warning systems, air disc brakes and high performance wide brake drums, electronic roll stability and, more recently, forward-facing cameras. 
COVID-19 Update
​
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we moved quickly to enable our office employees to work remotely starting March 2020. Since then, non-remote personnel have largely been limited to employees working on-site at customer locations and shop technicians working in our facilities, all of whom are following strict protocols to ensure their safety and the safety of our customers.
​
We have instituted policies to facilitate effective communication in this environment. For non-driving employees, we ensure multiple daily contacts with direct reports and have developed key performance indicators, facilitated by our digital capabilities, to measure our operational effectiveness. We have also implemented a hotline and support staff to ensure employees have access to necessary medical services as well as ensuring an adequate supply of safety equipment, including masks and gloves, for our workers who are on the frontlines, and providing regular cleaning and disinfecting of our facilities. U.S. Xpress’ employees are playing an essential role in the country’s fight against COVID-19 as they work to keep critical supplies moving and store shelves stocked. We are working daily with our drivers to keep them informed and safe in this rapidly changing environment.

Insurance
We retain high deductibles on a significant portion of our claims exposure and related expenses associated with third party bodily injury and property damage, employee medical expenses, workers’ compensation, physical damage to our equipment and cargo loss. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” We currently carry the following material types of insurance, which generally have the retention amounts, maximum benefits per claim and other limitations noted:
● commercial automobile liability excess coverage: approximately $75.0 million of coverage per occurrence effective September 1, 2020, subject to a $3.0 million retention per occurrence with annual aggregate limits within the $3.0 to $10.0 million layer of $14.0 million and a three-year policy aggregate of $28.0 million;
● general liability, business auto liability and excess employer’s liability coverage: approximately $75.0 million of coverage per occurrence subject to a $25,000 deductible per occurrence for general liability claims, $50,000 deductible per occurrence for business auto claims and $500,000 deductible for excess employer’s liability:
● cargo damage and loss: $2.0 million limit per tractor or trailer subject to a $250,000 retention per occurrence;
● workers’ compensation/employers’ liability: statutory coverage limits subject to a $500,000 retention for each accident or disease;
● employment practices and wage and hour liability: $25.0 million aggregate limit in coverage subject to a $1.0 million retention for employment practices and $2.5 million retention for wage and hour for either a single claim or a class action;
● directors’ and officers’ insurance: $75.0 million aggregate limit of coverage subject to a $1.0 million retention with various sub-limits;
● fiduciary liability policy: $10.0 million aggregate limit of coverage subject to a $10,000 retention;
● employee healthcare: we retain each employee health care claim and maintain stop loss insurance of $1.0 million;
● crime insurance: $5.0 million of coverage subject to a $250,000 retention; and
● underground storage tank liability: $5.0 million in coverage with deductibles ranging from $25,000 to $75,000.
Regulation
Transportation Regulations
Our operations are regulated and licensed by various government agencies, including the Department of Transportation (“DOT”), Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the Department of Homeland security (“DHS”). These and other federal and state agencies also regulate our equipment, operations, drivers and third-party carriers.
The DOT, through the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”), imposes safety and fitness regulations on us and our drivers, including rules that restrict driver hours-of-service. Changes to such hours-of-service rules can negatively impact our productivity and affect our operations and profitability by reducing the number of hours per day or week our drivers may operate and/or disrupting our network. However, in August 2019, the FMCSA issued a proposal to make changes to its hours-of-service rules that would allow truck drivers more flexibility with their 30-minute rest break and with dividing their time in the sleeper berth. It also would extend by two hours the duty time for drivers encountering adverse weather, and extend the shorthaul exemption by lengthening the drivers’ maximum on-duty period from 12 hours to 14 hours. In June 2020 the FMCSA adopted a final rule substantially as proposed, which became effective in September 2020. Certain industry groups have challenged these rules in court, and it remains unclear what, if anything, will come from such challenges. Any future changes to hours-of-service rules could materially adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.

Page 11




There are two methods of evaluating the safety and fitness of carriers. The first method is the application of a safety rating that is based on an onsite investigation and affects a carrier’s ability to operate in interstate commerce. We currently have a satisfactory DOT safety rating for our U.S. operations under this method, which is the highest available rating under the current safety rating scale. If we were to receive a conditional or unsatisfactory DOT safety rating, it could materially adversely affect our business, as some of our existing customer contracts require a satisfactory DOT safety rating. In January 2016, the FMCSA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking outlining a revised safety rating measurement system, which would replace the current methodology. Under the proposed rule, the current three safety ratings of “satisfactory,” “conditional” and “unsatisfactory” would be replaced with a single safety rating of “unfit,” and a carrier would be deemed fit when no rating was assigned. Moreover, the proposed rules would use roadside inspection data in addition to investigations and onsite reviews to determine a carrier’s safety fitness on a monthly basis. Under the current rules, a safety rating can only be given upon completion of a comprehensive onsite audit or review. Under the proposed rules, a carrier would be evaluated each month and could be given an “unfit” rating if the data collected from roadside inspections, investigations and onsite reviews did not meet certain standards. The proposed rule underwent a public comment period extending into May 2016 and several industry groups and lawmakers have expressed their disagreement with the proposed rule, arguing that it violates the requirements of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (the “FAST Act”), and that the FMCSA must first finalize its review of the Compliance, Safety, Accountability program (“CSA”) scoring system, described in further detail below. Based on this feedback and other concerns raised by industry stakeholders, in March 2017, the FMCSA withdrew the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking related to the new safety rating system. In its notice of withdrawal, the FMCSA noted that a new rulemaking related to a similar process may be initiated in the future. Therefore, it is uncertain if, when or under what form any such rule could be implemented. The FMCSA has also indicated that it is in the early phases of a new study on the causation of crashes. Although it remains unclear whether such study will ultimately be completed, the results of such study could spur further proposed and/or final rules in regard to safety and fitness.
In addition to the safety rating system, the FMCSA has adopted the CSA program as an additional safety enforcement and compliance model that evaluates and ranks fleets on certain safety-related standards. The CSA program analyzes data from roadside inspections, moving violations, crash reports from the last two years and investigation results. The data is organized into seven categories. Carriers are grouped by category with other carriers that have a similar number of safety events (e.g., crashes, inspections or violations) and carriers are ranked and assigned a rating percentile to prioritize them for interventions if they are above a certain threshold. Currently, these scores do not have a direct impact on a carrier’s safety rating. However, the occurrence of unfavorable scores in one or more categories may (i) affect driver recruiting and retention by causing high-quality drivers to seek employment with other carriers, (ii) cause our customers to direct their business away from us and to carriers with higher fleet rankings, (iii) subject us to an increase in compliance reviews and roadside inspections, (iv) cause us to incur greater than expected expenses in our attempts to improve unfavorable scores or (v) increase our insurance expenses, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.
Under the CSA, these scores were initially made available to the public in five of the seven categories. However, pursuant to the FAST Act which was signed into law in December 2015, the FMCSA was required to remove from public view the previously available CSA scores while it reviews the reliability of the scoring system. During this period of review by the FMCSA, we will continue to have access to our own scores and will still be subject to intervention by the FMCSA when such scores are above the intervention thresholds. A study was conducted and delivered to the FMCSA in June 2017 with several recommendations to make the CSA program more fair, accurate, and reliable. In late June 2018, the FMCSA provided a report to Congress outlining the changes it may make to the CSA program in response to the study. Such changes include the testing and possible adoption of a revised risk modeling theory, potential collection and dissemination of additional carrier data and revised measures for intervention thresholds. The adoption of such changes is contingent on the results of the new modeling theory and additional public feedback. Therefore, it is unclear if, when and to what extent such changes to the CSA program will occur. However, any changes that increase the likelihood of us receiving unfavorable scores could materially adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.
In May 2020 the FMCSA announced that effective immediately it is making permanent a pilot program that will not count a crash in which a motor carrier was not at fault when calculating the carrier’s safety measurement profile, called the Crash Preventability Demonstration Program (“CPDP”). The CPDP will expand the types of eligible crashes, modify the Safety Measurement System to exclude crashes with not preventable determinations from the prioritization algorithm and note the not preventable determinations in the Pre-Employment Screening Program. Under the program, carriers with eligible crashes that occurred on or after August 2019, may submit a Request for Data Review with the required police accident report and other supporting documents, photos or videos through the FMCSA’s DataQs website. If the FMCSA determines the crash was not preventable, it will be listed on the Safety Measurement System but not included when calculating a 

Page 12




carrier’s Crash Indicator Behavior Analysis and Safety Improvement Category measure in SMS. Additionally, the not preventable determinations will be noted on a driver’s Pre-Employment Screening Program report.
The final rule requiring the use of ELDs was published in December 2015. This rule required drivers of commercial motor vehicles that are required to keep logs to be ELD-compliant by December 2017. Use of automatic onboard recording devices was permitted until December 2019, at which time use of ELDs became required. We were fully converted to ELDs by the December 2019 deadline. We believe that more effective hours-of-service enforcement under this rule may improve our competitive position by causing all carriers to adhere more closely to hours-of-service requirements.
In December 2016, the FMCSA issued a final rule establishing a national clearinghouse for drug and alcohol testing results and requiring motor carriers and medical review officers to provide records of violations by commercial drivers of FMCSA drug and alcohol testing requirements. Motor carriers are required to query the clearinghouse to ensure drivers and driver applicants do not have violations of federal drug and alcohol testing regulations that prohibit them from operating commercial motor vehicles. The final rule became effective in January 2017, with a compliance date in January 2020. In December 2019, however, the FMCSA announced a final rule extending by three years the date for state driver’s licensing agencies to comply with certain Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse requirements. The December 2016 commercial driver’s license rule required states to request information from the Clearinghouse about individuals prior to issuing, renewing, upgrading or transferring a CDL. This new action will allow states’ compliance with the requirement, which was set to begin January 2020, to be delayed until January 2023. That being said, the FMCSA has indicated it will allow states the option to voluntarily query Clearinghouse information beginning January 2020. The compliance date of January 2020 remained in place for all other requirements set forth in the Clearinghouse final rule, however. Upon implementation, the rule may reduce the number of available drivers in an already constrained driver market. Pursuant to a new rule finalized by the FMCSA, effective November 2021, states are required to query the Clearinghouse when issuing, renewing, transferring, or upgrading a commercial driver’s license and must revoke a driver’s commercial driving privileges if such driver is prohibited from driving a motor vehicle for one or more drug or alcohol violations.
In September 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”) announced proposed mandatory guidelines to allow employers to drug test truck drivers and other federal workers for pre-employment and random testing using hair specimens. However, the proposal also requires a second sample using either urine or an oral swab test if a hair test is positive, if a donor is unable to provide a sufficient amount of hair for faith-based or medical reasons, or due to an insufficient amount or length of hair. The proposal specifically requires that the second test be done simultaneously at the collection event or when directed by the medical review officer after review and verification of laboratory-reported results for the hair specimen. DHHS indicated the two-test approach is intended to protect federal workers from issues that have been identified as limitations of hair testing, and related legal deficiencies identified in two prior court cases. The American Trucking Associations (“ATA”) has voiced concerns with the new guidelines, characterizing them as “weak” and “misguided,” and specially taking issue with the second sample requirement, which the ATA feels diminishes the value of hair testing. It is unclear if, and when, a final rule may be put in place. Any final rule may reduce the number of available drivers. We currently perform hair follicle testing and will continue monitor any developments in this area to ensure compliance.
Other rules have been recently proposed or made final by the FMCSA, including (i) a rule requiring the use of speed limiting devices on heavy duty tractors to restrict maximum speeds, which was proposed in 2016, and (ii) a rule setting forth minimum driver-training standards for new drivers applying for commercial driver’s licenses for the first time and to experienced drivers upgrading their licenses or seeking a hazardous materials endorsement, which was made final in December 2016, with a compliance date in February 2020. However, in May 2020, the FMCSA approved an interim rule delaying implementation of the final rule by two years which extended the compliance date to February 2022. In July 2017, the DOT announced that it would no longer pursue a speed limiter rule, but left open the possibility that it could resume such a pursuit in the future. In May 2021, however, the Cullum Owings Large Truck Safe Operating Speed Act was reintroduced into the U.S. House of Representatives and would require commercial motor vehicles with a gross weight of more than 26,000 pounds to be equipped with a speed limiter that would limit the vehicle’s speed to no more than 65 M.P.H. The effect of these rules, to the extent they become effective, could result in a decrease in fleet production and driver availability, either of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (“IIJA”), signed into law by President Biden in November 2021, created an apprenticeship program for drivers younger than 21 to eventually qualify to drive commercial trucks in interstate commerce. The provision drew certain mechanics from the bills introduced in Congress in 2019 related to lowering the 

Page 13




age requirements for interstate commercial driving. The FMCSA announced the establishment of this apprenticeship program in January 2022 in an effort to help the industry’s ongoing driver shortage. The program is open to 18 to 20-year-old drivers who already hold intrastate commercial driver’s licenses and sets a strict training regimen for participating drivers and carriers to comply with. Motor carriers interested in participating must complete an application for participation and submit monthly data on an apprentice’s driver activity, safety outcomes, and additional supporting information. It remains unclear whether any regulatory changes will stem from the apprenticeship program. 
In December 2018, the FMCSA granted a petition filed by the ATA and in doing so determined that federal law does preempt California’s wage and hour laws, and interstate truck drivers are not subject to such laws. The FMCSA’s decision has been appealed by labor groups, and multiple lawsuits have been filed in federal courts seeking to overturn the decision. In January 2021, the Ninth Circuit upheld the FMCSA’s determination that federal law does preempt California’s meal and rest break laws, as applied to drivers of property-carrying commercial motor vehicles. Other current and future state and local wage and hour laws, including laws related to employee meal breaks and rest periods, may also vary significantly from federal law. Further, driver piece rate compensation, which is an industry standard, has been attacked as non-compliant with state minimum wage laws and lawsuits have recently been filed and/or adjudicated against carriers demanding compensation for sleeper berth time, layovers, rest breaks and pre-trip and post-trip inspections, the outcome of which could have major implications for the treatment of time that drivers spend off-duty (whether in a truck’s sleeper berth or otherwise) under applicable wage laws. Both of these issues are adversely impacting the Corporation and the industry as a whole, with respect to the practical application of the laws, thereby resulting in additional cost. As a result, we, along with other companies in our industry, are subject to an uneven patchwork of wage and hour laws throughout the United States. In the past, certain legislators have proposed federal legislation to preempt state and local wage and hour laws; however, passage of such legislation is uncertain. If federal legislation is not passed, we will either need to comply with the most restrictive state and local laws across our entire fleet, or revise our management systems to comply with varying state and local laws. Either solution could result in increased compliance and labor costs, driver turnover, decreased efficiency, and amplified legal exposure.
Tax and other regulatory authorities, as well as independent contractors themselves, have increasingly asserted that independent contractor drivers in the trucking industry are employees rather than independent contractors and our classification of independent contractors has been the subject of audits by such authorities from time to time. Federal legislation has been introduced in the past that would make it easier for tax and other authorities to reclassify independent contractors as employees, including legislation to increase the recordkeeping requirements for those that engage independent contractor drivers and to increase the penalties for companies who misclassify their employees and are found to have violated employees’ overtime and/or wage requirements. The most recent example being the Protecting the Rights to Organize (“PRO”) Act, which was passed by the House of Representatives and received by the Senate in March 2021 and remains with the Senate’s Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. The PRO Act proposes to apply the “ABC Test” for classifying workers under Federal Fair Labor Standards Act claims. It is unknown whether any of the proposed legislation will become law or whether any industry-based exemptions from any resulting law will be granted. Additionally, federal legislators have sought to abolish the current safe harbor allowing taxpayers meeting certain criteria to treat individuals as independent contractors if they are following a long-standing, recognized practice, extend the Fair Labor Standards Act to independent contractors and impose notice requirements based on employment or independent contractor status and fines for failure to comply. Some states have put initiatives in place to increase their revenue from items such as unemployment, workers’ compensation and income taxes and a reclassification of independent contractors as employees would help states with this initiative.
Recently, courts in certain states have issued decisions that could result in a greater likelihood that independent contractors would be judicially classified as employees in such states. In September 2019, California enacted A.B. 5 (“AB5”), a new law that changed the landscape of the state’s treatment of employees and independent contractors. AB5 provides that the three-pronged “ABC Test” must be used to determine worker classification in wage-order claims. Under the ABC Test, a worker is presumed to be an employee—and the burden to demonstrate their independent contractor status is on the hiring company through satisfying all 3 of the following criteria:

● | the worker is free from control and direction in the performance of services; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the worker is performing work outside the usual course of the business of the hiring company; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
How AB5 will be enforced is still to be determined. In January 2021, however, the California Supreme Court ruled that the ABC Test could apply retroactively to all cases not yet final as of the date the original decision was rendered, April 

Page 14




30, 2018. While AB5 was set to go into effect in January 2020, a federal judge in California issued a preliminary injunction barring the enforcement of AB5 on the trucking industry while the California Trucking Association (“CTA”) moves forward with its suit seeking to invalidate AB5. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the reasoning behind the injunction in April 2021, ruling that AB5 is not pre-empted by federal law, but granted a stay of the AB5 mandate in June 2021 (preventing its application and temporarily continuing the injunction) while the CTA petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court (the “Supreme Court”) to review the decision. In November 2021, the Supreme Court requested that the U.S. solicitor general weigh in on the case. The injunction will remain in place until the Supreme Court makes a decision on whether to proceed in hearing the case. While the stay of the AB5 mandate provides temporary relief to the enforcement of AB5, it remains unclear how long such relief will last, and whether the CTA will ultimately be successful in invalidating the law. It is also possible AB5 will spur similar legislation in states other than California, which could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability. 
Further, class actions and other lawsuits have been filed against certain members of our industry seeking to reclassify independent contractors as employees for a variety of purposes, including workers’ compensation and health care coverage. Taxing and other regulatory authorities and courts apply a variety of standards in their determination of independent contractor status. If independent contractors we contract with are determined to be employees, we would incur additional exposure under federal and state tax, workers’ compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings.
Environmental Regulations
From time to time we engage in the transportation of hazardous substances. Additionally, some of our tractor terminals are located in areas where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination could occur. Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage, and hazardous waste disposal, among others. Certain of our facilities have wash facilities, waste oil or fuel storage tanks and fueling islands. If we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances, if there are releases of hazardous substances we transport, if soil or groundwater contamination is found at our facilities or results from our operations, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to cleanup costs and liabilities, including substantial fines or penalties or civil and criminal liability, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In August 2011, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (the “NHTSA”) and the EPA adopted a new rule that established the first-ever fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards for medium and heavy-duty vehicles, including the tractors we employ (the “Phase 1 Standards”). The Phase 1 Standards apply to tractor model years 2014 to 2018 and require the achievement of an approximate 20 percent reduction in fuel consumption by the 2018 model year, which equates to approximately four gallons of fuel for every 100 miles traveled. In addition, in February 2014, President Obama announced that his administration would begin developing the next phase of tighter fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas standards for medium-and heavy-duty tractors and trailers (the “Phase 2 Standards”). In October 2016, the EPA and NHTSA published the final rule mandating that the Phase 2 Standards will apply to trailers beginning with model year 2018 and tractors beginning with model year 2021. The Phase 2 Standards require nine percent and 25 percent reductions in emissions and fuel consumption for trailers and tractors, respectively, by 2027. The final rule was effective in December 2016, but has since faced challenges and delays. In October 2017, the EPA announced a proposal to repeal the Phase 2 Standards as they relate to gliders (which mix refurbished older components, including transmissions and pre-emission-rule engines, with a new frame, cab, steer axle, wheels, and other standard equipment). The outcome of such proposal is still undetermined. Additionally, implementation of the Phase 2 Standards as they relate to trailers has been challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. In November 2021, a panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of the association challenging the standards and vacated all portions of the Phase 2 Standards that applied to trailers, and consequently, the Phase 2 Standards will only require reductions in emissions and fuel consumption for tractors. The Company’s new tractor purchases in 2021 complied with the emission and fuel consumption reductions required by the Phase 2 Standards. Even though the trailer provisions of the Phase 2 standards have been removed, we will still need to ensure the majority of our fleet is compliant with the California Phase 2 standards.
In January 2020, the EPA announced it is seeking input on reducing emissions of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants from heavy-duty trucks. The EPA anticipates taking final action on the new plan, commonly referred to as the “Cleaner Trucks Initiative,” as soon as 2022. The EPA is targeting 2027 for these new standards to take effect and is also working on enacting more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards (beginning with model year 2030 vehicles) by the end of 2024. 

Page 15




The California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) also adopted emission control regulations that will be applicable to all heavy-duty tractors that pull 53-foot or longer box-type trailers within the State of California. The tractors and trailers subject to these CARB regulations must be either EPA SmartWay certified or equipped with low-rolling resistance tires and retrofitted with SmartWay-approved aerodynamic technologies. Enforcement of these CARB regulations for 2011 model year equipment began in January 2010 and have been phased in over several years for older equipment. In order to comply with the CARB regulations, we submitted a large fleet compliance plan to CARB in June 2010. In addition, in February 2017 CARB proposed California Phase 2 standards that would generally align with the federal Phase 2 Standards, with some minor additional requirements, and as proposed would stay in place even if the federal Phase 2 Standards are affected. In February 2019, the California Phase 2 standards became final. Thus, even though the trailer provisions of the Phase 2 Standards were removed, we will still need to ensure the majority of our fleet is compliant with the California Phase 2 standards, which may result in increased equipment costs and could adversely affect our operating results and profitability. CARB has also recently announced intentions to adopt regulations ensuring that 100% of tractors operating in California are operating with battery or fuel cell-electric engines in the future. Whether these regulations will ultimately be adopted remains unclear. We will continue monitoring our compliance with the CARB regulations. Federal and state lawmakers also have proposed potential limits on carbon emissions under a variety of climate-change proposals. Compliance with such regulations has increased the cost of our new tractors, may increase the cost of any new trailers that will operate in California, may require us to retrofit certain of our pre-2011 model year trailers that operate in California and could impair equipment productivity and increase our operating expenses. These adverse effects, combined with the uncertainty as to the reliability of the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values of these vehicles, could materially increase our costs or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In June 2020 CARB also passed the Advanced Clean Trucks (“ACT”) regulation, which became effective in March 2021 and generally requires original equipment manufacturers to begin shifting towards greater production of zero-emission heavy duty tractors starting in 2024. Under ACT, by 2045, every new tractor sold in California will need to be zero-emission. While ACT does not apply to those simply operating tractors in California, it could affect the cost and/or supply of traditional diesel tractors and may lead to similar legislation in other states or at the federal level. 
In order to reduce exhaust emissions, some states and municipalities have begun to restrict the locations and amount of time where diesel-powered tractors may idle. These restrictions could force us to purchase on-board power units that do not require the engine to idle or to alter its drivers’ behavior, which could result in increased costs.
In addition to the foregoing laws and regulations, our operations are subject to other federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, many of which are implemented by the EPA and similar state agencies. Such laws and regulations generally govern the management and handling of hazardous materials, discharge of pollutants into the air, surface water and other environmental media, and groundwater preservation and disposal of certain various substances. We do not believe that our compliance with these statutory and regulatory measures has had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Food Safety Regulations
In April 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) published a final rule establishing requirements for shippers, loaders, carriers by motor vehicle and rail vehicle and receivers engaged in the transportation of food, to use sanitary transportation practices to ensure the safety of the food they transport as part of the Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”). This rule sets forth requirements related to (i) the design and maintenance of equipment used to transport food, (ii) the measures taken during food transportation to ensure food safety, (iii) the training of carrier personnel in sanitary food transportation practices and (iv) maintenance and retention of records of written procedures, agreements and training related to the foregoing items. These requirements took effect for larger carriers such as us in April 2017. The FSMA is applicable to us not only as a carrier, but we are also considered a shipper when acting in the role of broker. We believe we have been in compliance with the FSMA since the compliance date. However, if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations related to the FSMA or if we transport food or goods that are contaminated or are found to cause illness and/or death, we could be subject to substantial fines, lawsuits, penalties and/or criminal and civil liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
As the FDA continues its efforts to modernize food safety, it is likely additional food safety regulations will take effect in the future. In July 2020, the FDA released its “New Era of Smarter Food Safety” blueprint, which creates a ten year roadmap to create a more digital, traceable and safer food system. This blueprint builds on the work done under the FSMA, and while it is still unclear what, if any, changes to the current governing framework may ultimately take effect, further 

Page 16




regulation in this area could negatively affect our business by increasing our compliance obligations and related expenses going forward. 
Executive and Legislative Climate
It is still to be determined how President Biden’s leadership will impact our industry. That being said, President Biden has indicated his intent to make a green infrastructure package a top priority for his administration. Any measure in furtherance thereof could draw from the Build Back Better Act (the “BBB”), which passed the U.S. House of Representatives, but is facing resistance in the U.S. Senate. As currently proposed, the BBB would impact transportation by allocating funds to address various industry related issues such as port congestion and traffic safety enforcement. The bill also promotes a myriad of low-emission programs, transit services and clean energy projects, as well as funding for climate change research. It is unclear whether these legislative initiatives will be signed into law and what changes they may undergo. However, adoption and implementation could negatively impact our business by increasing our compliance obligations and related expenses. 
President Biden also has indicated an intention to make substantial changes to the current U.S. tax laws during his administration, including changes to the way capital gains are treated. Any changes to U.S. tax laws may have an adverse impact on our business and profitability.
The United States Mexico Canada Agreement (“USMCA”) was entered into effect in July 2020. The USMCA is designed to modernize food and agriculture trade, advance rules of origin for automobiles and trucks, and enhance intellectual property protections, among other matters, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. It is difficult to predict at this stage what could be the impact of the USMCA on the economy, including the transportation industry. However, given the amount of North American trade that moves by truck, it could have a significant impact on supply and demand in the transportation industry, and could adversely impact the amount, movement and patterns of freight we transport.
The IIJA was signed into law by President Biden in November 2021. The roughly $1.2 trillion bill contains an estimated $550 billion in new spending, which will impact transportation. In particular, it dedicates more than $100 billion for surface transportation networks and roughly $66 billion for freight and passenger rail operations. Among provisions in the law specific to trucking is the aforementioned apprenticeship program for drivers younger than 21 to eventually qualify to drive commercial trucks in interstate commerce. It remains unclear how the IIJA will be implemented into and effect our industry. The IIJA may result in increased compliance and implementation related expenses, which could have a negative impact on our operations. 
Given COVID-19’s considerable effect on our industry, the FMCSA issued and/or extended various temporary responsive measures throughout the year. Although, to date, these measures have largely been enacted in order to assist industry participants in operating under adverse circumstances, any further responsive measures remain unclear and could have a negative impact on our operations.
In November 2021, the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) published an emergency temporary standard (the “Emergency Rule”) requiring all employers with at least 100 employees to ensure that their employees are fully vaccinated or require any employees who remain unvaccinated to produce a negative COVID-19 test result on at least a weekly basis before coming to work. The Emergency Rule has been blocked by the Supreme Court. Effective January 2022, the U.S. is prohibiting unvaccinated foreigners from crossing the U.S.-Mexico border and U.S.-Canada border. Furthermore, effective January 2022, Canada is prohibiting unvaccinated foreigners, including U.S. citizens, from crossing their border. These border requirements, as well as any future vaccination, testing or mask mandates that are allowed to go into effect, could, among other things, (i) cause our unvaccinated employees to go to smaller employers, if such employers are not subject to future mandates, or leave us or the trucking industry, especially our unvaccinated drivers, (ii) result in logistical issues, increased expenses, and operational issues from arranging for weekly tests of our unvaccinated employees, especially our unvaccinated drivers, (iii) result in increased costs for recruiting and retention of drivers, as well as the cost of weekly testing, and (iv) result in decreased revenue if we are unable to recruit and retain drivers. Any vaccination, testing or mask mandates that are interpreted as applying to drivers would significantly reduce the pool of drivers available to us and our industry, which would further impact the extreme shortage of available drivers. Accordingly, any vaccination, testing or mask mandates, if allowed to go into effect, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
For further discussion regarding these laws and regulations, please see the section entitled “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Seasonality
In the trucking industry, revenue has historically decreased as customers reduce shipments following the winter holiday season and as inclement weather impedes operations. At the same time, operating expenses have generally increased, with fuel efficiency declining because of engine idling and weather, causing more physical damage equipment repairs and insurance claims and costs. For the reasons stated, first quarter results historically have been lower than results in each of the other three quarters of the year. Over the past several years, we have seen increases in demand at varying times, including surges between Thanksgiving and the year-end holiday season.
