Item 1. Business
Description of Business
South Jersey Industries, Inc. (SJI or the Company), a New Jersey corporation, was formed in 1969 for the purpose of owning and holding all of the outstanding common stock of South Jersey Gas Company, a public utility, and acquiring and developing non-utility lines of business.

SJI provides a variety of energy-related products and services, primarily through the following wholly-owned subsidiaries:
•SJIU is a holding company that owns SJG, ETG and ELK.
▪SJG is a regulated natural gas utility which distributes natural gas in the seven southernmost counties of New Jersey.
•ETG is a regulated natural gas utility which distributes natural gas in seven counties in northern and central New Jersey.
•ELK is a regulated natural gas utility which distributes natural gas in northern Maryland. In December 2019, the Company announced it had entered into an agreement to sell ELK to a third-party buyer, pending MPSC approval (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).
•SJE acquires and markets electricity to retail end users. In November 2018, the Company sold SJE's retail gas business.
•SJRG markets natural gas storage, commodity and transportation assets along with fuel management services on a wholesale basis in the mid-Atlantic, Appalachian and southern states.
•SJEX owns oil, gas and mineral rights in the Marcellus Shale region of Pennsylvania.
•Marina develops and operates on-site energy-related projects. Included in Marina is MTF, which, in February 2020, was sold to a third party buyer (see "Agreement to Sell MTF & ACB" below). Also included in Marina are three solar projects which are held for sale. The significant wholly-owned subsidiaries of Marina include:
•ACB, which owns and operates a natural gas fueled combined heating, cooling and power facility located in Atlantic City, New Jersey. ACB is included in the sale to a third party buyer (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).
•ACLE, BCLE, SCLE and SXLE, which owns and operates landfill gas-to-energy production facilities in Atlantic, Burlington, Salem and Sussex Counties in New Jersey.
•MCS, NBS and SBS, which owned and operated solar-generation sites located in New Jersey. These entities were sold in October 2018.
•SJESP receives commissions on service contracts from a third party. 
•Midstream invests in infrastructure and other midstream projects, including PennEast. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.
•SJEI provides energy procurement and cost reduction services. AEP, an aggregator, broker and consultant in the retail energy markets, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SJEI after completion of the AEP acquisition in August 2019.

Acquisitions:
On July 1, 2018, SJI, through its wholly-owned subsidiary SJIU, acquired the assets of ETG and ELK from Pivotal Utility Holdings, Inc., a subsidiary of Southern Company Gas (collectively, the "Acquisition"), for total consideration of $1.72 billion after the settlement of working capital. 
South Jersey Industries, Inc.
Part I

On August 31, 2019, SJI, through its wholly-owned subsidiary SJEI, completed its acquisition of AEP for $4.0 million in total consideration. 
See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
Divestitures:
In December 2019, the Company announced it had entered into an agreement to sell MTF and ACB to a third-party buyer for an initial sales price of $100.0 million, which includes working capital. This sale closed on February 18, 2020 for a final sales price of $97.0 million, with the initial sales price being reduced by the amount of cash flows generated by MTF and ACB from October 1, 2019 through the date of closing (see Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements). 
In December 2019, the Company announced it had entered into an agreement to sell ELK to a third-party buyer for approximately $15.0 million, less any indebtedness at the time of closing, pending MPSC approval. This transaction is expected to close in the middle of 2020. 
On June 27, 2018, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Marina, entered into a series of agreements whereby Marina agreed to sell its portfolio of solar energy assets (the “Transaction”) to a third-party buyer. As part of the Transaction, Marina agreed to sell its distributed solar energy projects across New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts and Vermont (the “Projects”), along with the assets comprising the Projects. Also in connection with the Transaction, Marina is leasing back from the buyer certain of the Projects that have not yet passed the fifth anniversary of their placed-in-service dates for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The leaseback will run from the date each such project was acquired by the buyer until the later of the first anniversary of the applicable acquisition date and the fifth anniversary of the applicable placed-in-service date of the project. In July 2018, as part of the Transaction, Marina received a cash payment of $62.5 million for the sale of certain SRECs. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company closed on the majority of these Projects, including the wholly-owned subsidiaries MCS, NBS and SBS, with each project sold having met all conditions to satisfy closing. Total consideration received in the fourth quarter 2018 related to these sales was $228.1 million. During 2019, seven Projects were sold for total consideration of $24.3 million. The Company has three projects that are not part of the Transaction but are expected to be sold in 2020. The value of these unsold assets is $27.2 million. 
On November 30, 2018, SJI sold the retail gas business of SJE for total consideration of $15.0 million. As a result, SJE no longer acquires, transports or markets natural gas for retail markets.
See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.

Part I

ETG has direct connections to the interstate pipeline systems of Transco, Columbia, Tetco and Tennessee. ETG secures other long-term services from several inter-state pipelines, Dominion, National Fuel and Gulf South that are not directly connected to ETG and are upstream of the Transco and Tetco systems. Services provided by Dominion are utilized to deliver gas into either the Transco or Tetco systems for ultimate delivery to ETG. Services provided by National Fuel and Gulf South are utilized to deliver gas into the Transco system for ultimate delivery to ETG. ETG also secures third-party storage services from Stagecoach Gas Services and Stagecoach Pipeline & Storage Company. 
Total transportation under contract at SJG and ETG are 421,980 dts/d and 248,523 dts/d, respectively. These contracts have terms with various ending dates, ranging from October 31, 2022 through November 30, 2034.

The Company's intentions are to renew or extend these service agreements before they expire.
ELK has direct connections to the interstate pipeline systems of Eastern Shore Natural Gas, along with firm transportation agreements with Transco and Columbia Gas. The activities of ELK utility operations are not material.
Services provided by all of the above-mentioned pipelines are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC.  
Gas Supplies
SJG has two separate AMA's with gas marketers that extend through March 31, 2020. SJG released to the marketers its firm transportation rights, and in return the marketers manage this capacity and provide SJG with firm deliverability each day. The marketer's intents are to optimize the capacity released to SJG under these AMA's and pay SJG an asset management fee.
SJG has committed to a purchase of a minimum of 15,000 dts/d and up to 70,000 dts/d, from a supplier for a term of ten years at index-based prices. Also, in 2019 SJG entered into a 2-year purchase agreement with a producer delivering 5,000 dts/day at SJG’s Leidy Line for certified responsible gas from November 1, 2019 through October 31, 2021.
On July 1, 2018, ETG and ELK entered into an AMA with SJRG which extends through March 31, 2022. Under this agreement ETG and ELK released to SJRG and/or designated SJRG as agent for all firm transportation and storage contracts. SJRG is obligated to provide natural gas supply to meet demand requirements and optimize ETG’s and ELK's portfolio of natural gas transportation and storage contracts. SJRG pays a fixed fee and shares net margin generated through portfolio optimization.
As part of the gas purchasing strategy, the Utilities use financial contracts to hedge against forward price risk. These contracts are recoverable through the BGSS/PGA Clause, subject to BPU/MPSC approval. 
Supplemental Gas Supplies
SJG operates peaking facilities, located in McKee City, NJ, where it liquefies, stores and vaporizes LNG for injection into its distribution system. SJG's LNG facility has a storage capacity equivalent to 434,300 dts of natural gas and has an installed capacity to vaporize up to 118,250 dts of LNG per day for injection into its distribution system.
ETG operates a peaking facility, located in Elizabeth, NJ, where it stores and vaporizes LNG for injection into its distribution system. ETG's LNG facility has a storage capacity equivalent to 145,000 dts of natural gas and has an installed capacity to vaporize up to 25,000 dts of LNG per day for injection into its distribution system.

Peak-Day Supply

SJG plans for a winter season peak-day demand on the basis of an average daily temperature of 2 degrees F or 63 Heating Degree Days, while ETG's plans on an average daily temperature of 0 degrees F or 65 Heating Degree Days. Gas demand on such a design day for the 2019-2020 winter season is estimated to be 572,856 dts for SJG and 432,983 dts for ETG (excluding industrial customers). SJG and ETG project to have adequate supplies and interstate pipeline entitlements to meet design day requirements. SJG and ETG both experienced their highest peak-day demand for calendar year 2019 on January 21st.

Transportation and Storage Agreements
SJRG holds various firm transportation agreements with National Fuel, Transco, Dominion, Columbia, Tennessee and Tetco. Total transportation under contract is 503,291 dts/d. These contracts have terms with various ending dates, ranging from March 31, 2020 through March 31, 2043. SJRG's intentions are to renew or extend these service agreements before they expire.

The National Fuel contract, which expires March 31, 2020, will not be renewed. The remaining contracts have terms with various ending dates, ranging from June 30, 2020 through March 31, 2023, for which SJRG's intentions are to renew or extend these service agreements before they expire.
Gas Supplies

SJRG has entered into several long-term natural gas supply agreements to purchase 772,500 dts/d, depending upon production levels, for terms ranging from four to ten years at index-based prices. 
Patents and Franchises

The Utilities hold nonexclusive franchises granted by municipalities in the areas to which they serve. No other natural gas public utility presently serves the territory covered by the Utilities' franchises. Otherwise, patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises and concessions are not material to the business of the Utilities.
Seasonal Aspects

Utility Companies

The Utilities experience seasonal fluctuations in sales when selling natural gas for heating purposes. The Utilities meet these seasonal fluctuations in demand from firm customers by buying and storing gas during the summer months, and by drawing from storage and purchasing supplemental supplies during the heating season. As a result of this seasonality, the Utilities' revenues and net income are significantly higher during the first and fourth quarters than during the second and third quarters of the year.

Non-Utility Companies

Among SJI's non-utility activities, wholesale (including fuel supply management) has seasonal patterns similar to the Utilities. Activities such as energy services and energy project development do not follow seasonal patterns. Other activities, such as retail electric marketing, can have seasonal earnings patterns that are different from the Utilities. The first and fourth quarters remain the periods where most of SJI's revenue and net income is produced.
