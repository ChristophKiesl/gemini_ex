ITEM 1. | BUSINESS


The Company was originally incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 27, 2007. On March 14, 2018, the majority of the stock was purchased by MAAB Global Limited, resulting in the name change from CPSM, Inc to Astro Aerospace Ltd. and the business change from pool sales to the research and development of manned and cargo drones.

Current Operations
 The Company has acquired the software, firmware and hardware for Version 1.0 of a manned drone which has executed multiple flights. It is Astro’s goal to transform how people and things get from place to place. This will be done by making safe, affordable user-friendly autonomous manned and unmanned Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft available to the mass market anywhere. Astro is currently working on Version 2.0 of the aircraft product which will feature design changes that enhance performance characteristics and safety features. The target market will be government, private sector operators and individuals for a wide range of commercial, logistical and personal uses. The Company is currently in the flight testing mode of its Passenger Drone Version 1.0, as well as in the development stages of its version 2.0 Passenger Drone model. 

The Company is working with Infly Technology Ltd., our design and manufacturing partner, who is leading the design and development team with responsibility for developing the team as well as building the new prototypes for the two new aircraft models. The Company applied for approval to test the Passenger Drone 1.0 version in Canada in order to display new software, avionics and stability. The Company received an SFOC (Special Flight Operations Certificate) from Transport Canada in September 2018, allowing Astro to take to the sky, and put the Passenger Drone 1.0 “Elroy” through critical elements of integrated flight testing.  The testing culminated on Wednesday, September 19, 2018 with a 4 minute and 30 second flight, reaching heights of over 60 feet and speeds of over 50 km/h. The avionics and flight control systems were put to task with a multitude of maneuvers and the vehicle remained exceptionally stable, even under the effects of a couple of unexpected wind gusts.

The Company's newest prototype focuses on a multitude of applications including passenger transport, cargo delivery, ambulance and med-evac services, rescue and disaster assistance, military, and B2B. Its newly designed modular structure allows the Astro Top Frame (ALTA) to fly independently, as well as in combination with the individually designed "Astro Pods" for the specific need in that specific industry. A fly-in and pick-up system will allow the vehicle to connect, fly, disconnect and repeat, effectively and efficiently, changing from one application to the next. We refer to it as the Swiss Army Knife of the eVTOL world.

Along with recent Avionics and Control system upgrades this modularity opens the door to the evergrowing opportunities that (eVTOL) electric take-off and landing short haul vehicles bring. 

The Company anticipates the new prototype to be completed and flying by the end of the second quarter, 2021. We have completed the engineering and firmware for the prototype and are now in development of the body for the new prototype.

Asset Purchase Agreement with Confida Aerospace Ltd.
 On May 8, 2018, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Confida Aerospace Ltd. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company purchased in-process research and development (“IPRD”) consisting of inventory, hardware designs, software designs, and a trademark all pertaining to passenger drone design and use from Confida Aerospace Ltd. As consideration for the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company issued Confida Aerospace Ltd., 10,000 of the registrant’s Series B preferred shares.Each preferred share is convertible into 1,333 common shares and 1,333 warrants. Each warrant is exercisable into one of the Company’s common shares at an exercise price of $.75. The warrants have an exercise period of five years upon conversion. Additionally, the Company assumed $25,000 of debts incurred by Confida Aerospace Ltd. related to drone development.

Competition
 The Company is currently a research and development company focused on the creation of aerial drones for use in carrying passengers or cargo. It is expected that research and development will continue for at least two years, at which point we will seek out a joint venture to help manufacture the design. Once the research and development is complete, we intend to supply our products to a variety of industries, such as government, military, and for private use. The cargo drone is intended to be the first available product.

Our prime competitors are Volocopter, a German company, and Ehang, a Chinese company, which are both developing manned eVTOL craft. Our primary competitive advantage is our proprietary avionics and control systems. Currently, we have a working prototype that has flown while manned, and testing has shown that the design is very stable.

Employees
 As of May 29, 2020, we do not have any employees who are not executive officers.

Change of Control/Discontinued Operations
 On March 14, 2018, Lawrence and Loreen Calarco, officers and directors of the Company, the Lawrence & Loreen Calarco Family Trust and the Lawrence and Loreen Calarco Trust of June 3, 2014, majority stockholders controlled by Lawrence and Loreen Calarco, sold 51,711,571 common shares and 1,562,500 preferred shares to MAAB Global Limited (“MAAB”), a non-affiliate of the Company, paid from Bruce Bent, officer and director of MAAB’s personal funds resulting in a change of control of the Company. The stock was transferred to MAAB effective March 14, 2018. The 51,711,571 common shares and 1,562,500 preferred shares represented 62.35% and 100% of the then issued and outstanding common and preferred stock of the Company, respectively.

On April 30, 2018, pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement dated April 16, 2018, the Company exchanged all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Custom Pool & Spa Mechanics, Inc. and Custom Pool Plastering, its wholly owned subsidiaries, for 13,668,900 common shares of the Company held by the Lawrence & Loreen Calarco Family Trust, an entity controlled by Lawrence & Loreen Calarco, former officers and directors of the Company. The Board of Directors subsequently authorized the cancellation of those common shares. After said cancellation, the total issued and outstanding common shares was 69,270,060. The Share Exchange Agreement was approved by the Board of Directors and written consent of shareholders holding 62.35% of the voting securities of the Company as of April 16, 2018.

The Company’s discontinued operation, Custom Pool, historically was a full-service pool maintenance, resurfacing and repair company whose main service area is the Martin, Palm Beach, St. Lucie, Indian River and Brevard counties of Florida. The Company earned revenue by charging service fees in the pool service business and by payments under contracts in the pool resurfacing business. The Company managed its operating margins of the businesses by controlling personnel costs, chemical and material purchases and other service costs such as motor vehicle and insurance costs. Personnel were critical to the business since customers choose those companies who have the most experience and perform the service in a timely and professional manner.

Custom Pool competed in its markets on the basis of price and the quality of the service. There are many pool service companies in the market and throughout Florida. However, this also presented an opportunity for the Company since many of its competitors are smaller and lack the infrastructure and depth of the Company. This allowed the Company to compete through offering a larger range of services with a lower cost structure and to pursue growth opportunities either through internal growth or through opportunistic acquisitions.
