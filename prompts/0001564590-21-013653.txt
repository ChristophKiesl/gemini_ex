Overview
 Ra Medical Systems, Inc. is a commercial-stage medical device company leveraging our advanced excimer laser-based platform for use in the treatment of vascular and dermatological immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. We believe our products enhance patients’ quality of life by restoring blood-flow in arteries and clearing chronic skin conditions. 
 The DABRA laser and single-use catheter, together referred to as DABRA, is used as a tool in the treatment of peripheral artery disease, or PAD, which commonly occurs in the legs. DABRA is cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, as a device for crossing chronic total occlusions, or CTOs, in patients with symptomatic infrainguinal lower extremity vascular disease and with an intended use for ablating a channel in occlusive peripheral vascular disease. DABRA was also granted CE mark approval in Europe in September 2016 for the endovascular treatment of infrainguinal arteries via atherectomy and for crossing total occlusions. 
 Our vascular business strategy is focused on multiple engineering efforts to improve our catheter offering as well as conducting a clinical study to obtain an atherectomy “indication for use” in the United States. Key catheter engineering efforts currently underway include projects to:
  
• | Extend our catheter’s shelf life. During 2020, we identified the factors limiting our shelf life, including the introduction of unwanted elements in the catheter’s fluid core and the degradation of the coating on the inner diameter, and are currently implementing multiple remediations to address these issues. Our initial internal accelerated aging test data supports shelf life for our catheter of at least six months;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increase the robustness of our catheter via a braided overjacket, or a similar design, to make the catheter more kink-resistant when navigating tortuous anatomy. We expect to complete the engineering work for this catheter in the second half of 2021 and subsequently submit to the FDA for clearance; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Develop a version of the DABRA catheter that is compatible with a standard guidewire. We completed several guidewire-compatible catheter prototypes in the fourth quarter of 2020 and then conducted in vitro evaluations with several physicians. We expect to finalize the design for this catheter at the end of 2021.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As stated, we are currently pursuing an atherectomy indication for use, which the FDA defines to include a prespecified improvement in luminal patency. To satisfy the FDA’s data requirements to support an atherectomy indication, we are performing a pivotal study designed to allow the FDA to evaluate the use of DABRA in atherectomy procedures. We received an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, approval in January 2020 and the study is approved for up to 10 clinical sites and 100 subjects. 
 We enrolled the first subject in February 2020. Throughout much of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic substantially impacted our ability to activate new sites and enroll additional subjects. Many sites or potential sites have been or are currently operating at a reduced capacity, and some have been closed from time to time. In addition, potential study subjects may voluntarily opt to postpone their procedures due to COVID-19 concerns. As of March 11, 2021, we have enrolled 30 subjects and five sites have been cleared to enroll subjects. Due to the unpredictable impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had and will continue to have on enrollment in this study, we currently cannot estimate when enrollment will be completed.
 We have paused shipments of catheters to commercial sites while we conduct further studies on the stability of our shelf life. We submitted additional test data in March 2021, which will need to be cleared by the FDA prior to resuming commercial shipments of catheters. We are continuing to supply catheters to those sites involved in our atherectomy clinical study. We do not anticipate rebuilding our vascular sales team until most of our engineering projects are complete and we have a more definitive timeline for obtaining an atherectomy indication.

Our Pharos laser is a medical device that we have marketed since October 2004 as a tool for the treatment of proliferative skin conditions including psoriasis, vitiligo, atopic dermatitis, and leukoderma. The COVID-19 pandemic is negatively impacting the dermatology business as many customers delay the acquisition or purchase of capital equipment such as our Pharos laser. Because this business does not have a disposables component and we augment our capital equipment sales with recurring revenue derived from service and/or rental or lease agreements, we are experiencing less of an impact than business models that rely solely on capital equipment and/or disposables sales. We believe there could be an opportunity to grow the Pharos business in a capital-efficient after the business disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have subsided.
 Recent Developments
 COVID-19
 The global spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. The ultimate effects of the COVID-19 on our business, operations and financial condition are unknown at this time. In the near term, we expect that our revenue will continue to be adversely impacted and enrollment in our atherectomy clinical trial will continue to be delayed or slowed, as patients elect to postpone voluntary treatments and physicians’ offices are either closed or operating at a reduced capacity. In addition, some customers are requesting more flexible payment terms on a temporary basis. We also may not be able to secure additional financing in a timely manner or on favorable terms, if at all. Our manufacturing facility located in Carlsbad, California is currently operational. Employee travel is limited to essential travel only and many employees are working from home when feasible. We have experienced minor delays in receiving shipments of parts, which has affected the timing of our key engineering efforts. To date, the shipment delays have not had a material impact on our ability to support our atherectomy indication trial. However, the extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain it or treat its impact, among others.
Department of Justice Civil Settlement and Corporate Integrity Agreement
 On December 28, 2020, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with the United States of America, acting through the United States Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and on behalf of the Inspector General of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”), to resolve the pending DOJ investigation and a related civil action concerning our marketing of the DABRA laser system and DABRA-related remuneration to certain physicians. In connection with the Settlement Agreement, we also have reached tentative agreements that, if executed by participating states, resolve previously disclosed related investigations conducted by certain state attorneys general.
 The Settlement Agreement recites that a complaint filed by a former employee on behalf of the federal government in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, and subsequently amended to assert claims on behalf of certain states, alleged, among other things, that we violated the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3729, and certain state false claims acts by paying kickbacks to certain physicians in order to induce them to use the DABRA laser system, promoting off-label use of the DABRA laser system, failing to report adverse events to the United States Food and Drug Administration, marketing a device that does not work as advertised, and failing to adhere to Current Good Manufacturing Practices. The complaint, which was settled in connection with the Settlement Agreement, also alleged that we unlawfully retaliated against the former employee. Separate from the former employee’s allegations in the civil action, the United States and the participating states contend that from May 1, 2017 through October 31, 2019, we (a) paid illegal remuneration to certain physicians to induce them to use the DABRA laser system in violation of the federal anti-kickback statute and (b) marketed the DABRA laser system for off-label use in atherectomy procedures despite product performance issues causing calibration and overheating problems, which posed a risk to physicians and patients (the “Covered Conduct”). We deny the allegations in the civil action and those asserted by the United States and the participating states, and the settlement does not constitute an admission of liability or wrongdoing by us.
 Under the Settlement Agreement, and the tentative agreements with the participating states, we are required to make an initial payment of $2.5 million, of which we paid $2.4 million in December 2020 and will pay the remaining $0.1 million when the agreements with the participating states are finalized. Pursuant to the terms of the 
 5


Settlement Agreement, (a) if our revenue exceeds $10 million in any of the next four fiscal years (2021-2024), we also are required to pay an additional amount in settlement for the corresponding year: $500,000 for 2021, $750,000 for 2022, $1 million for 2023, and $1.25 million for 2024; (b) if we are acquired or are otherwise involved in a change in control transaction in the years 2020 through 2024, we are required to pay an additional settlement amount of $5 million, plus 4% of the value attributed to us in the transaction, so long as the attributed value is in excess of $100 million, with the total change in control payment never to exceed $28 million; and (c) if our obligations under the Settlement Agreement are avoided by bankruptcy, the United States may rescind the releases and bring an action against us in which we agree is not subject to an automatic stay, is not subject to any statute of limitations, estoppel or laches defense, and is a valid claim in the amount of $56 million, minus any prior change in control payments. Under the Settlement Agreement, we also paid the former employee’s reasonable expenses, costs and attorneys’ fees, which amount to $0.2 million.
 The OIG has agreed, conditioned upon our full payment of amounts owed in the Settlement Agreement, and in consideration of our obligations under a Corporate Integrity Agreement, to release our permissive exclusion rights and refrain from instituting any administrative action seeking to exclude us from participating in Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal health care programs as a result of the Covered Conduct. The Corporate Integrity Agreement has a five-year term and imposes monitoring, reporting, certification, documentation, oversight, screening, and training obligations on us, including the hiring of a compliance officer and independent review organization.
 Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the United States and the former employee have dismissed the complaint against us with prejudice and have released us from any civil or administrative monetary liability arising under the Covered Conduct. The Settlement Agreement does not include a release for any conduct other than the Covered Conduct or any criminal liability related to the Covered Conduct. The Settlement Agreement does not release any claims under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.
 DABRA.    DABRA (Destruction of Arteriosclerotic Blockages by laser Radiation Ablation) is our minimally-invasive excimer laser and single-use catheter system that is used by physicians as a tool in the endovascular treatment of vascular blockages resulting from lower extremity vascular disease, a form of PAD, both above- and below-the-knee, by breaking down plaque to its fundamental chemistry, such as proteins, lipids and other chemical compounds, to eliminate blockages by essentially dissolving them without generating potentially harmful particulates. The accumulation of plaque in arteries, which is a result of lower extremity vascular disease, most commonly occurs in the pelvis and legs. Plaque accumulation, known as atherosclerosis, causes the narrowing of arteries, thereby reducing the flow of oxygenated blood to tissue and organs. If vascular blockages are left untreated, they can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, amputation or death. Major risk factors for PAD include age, smoking, diabetes and obesity. Despite its prevalence, PAD is underdiagnosed and undertreated relative to many other serious vascular conditions, including coronary artery disease, or CAD, in part because up to half of the PAD population is asymptomatic, or shows no symptoms, and many dismiss symptoms as normal signs of aging. PAD affects approximately 17 million people in the U.S. However, only 20-30% of PAD patients are actively being treated.
Current treatments for vascular blockages associated with PAD are largely endovascular and include angioplasty, stenting and atherectomy. Bypass surgery, which was frequently used in the past, is costly and often results in complications, including post-surgery pain, hospital stays and recovery times. Endovascular treatments employ catheter-based products for the displacement or removal of plaque. These treatments also have limitations in their safety or efficacy profiles and frequently result in recurrence of the disease. 
 DABRA is a novel technology for use in the endovascular treatment of vascular blockages resulting from lower extremity vascular disease. We believe that our liquid-filled, full aperture ratio catheter allows for a less traumatic endovascular treatment for the removal of vascular blockages and offers potential benefits over competing treatments and therapies. DABRA is easy to use with proper physician training and can cross and debulk, or reduce or remove, a broad range of plaque types. DABRA is predominantly used as an adjunct therapy with angioplasty balloons, drug-coated balloons, stents, and other endovascular treatments. DABRA employs photoablation, or the removal of body tissue by using photons, to remove blockages by breaking the bonds of the obstructing plaque directly. DABRA is minimally invasive and is designed to not stretch the arterial walls or penetrate the layers of arterial tissue known as the subintimal space, which can lead to dissection, or a tear in the inner lining of the vessel wall, or perforation, or a hole or a break in the vessel wall, although these events may still occur with DABRA and 
 6


other competing products. We believe DABRA’s mechanism of action, photoablation, may result in less mechanical and thermal trauma to the vessel compared to other devices. In May 2017, we received FDA 510(k) clearance to market the DABRA laser system and single-use DABRA catheter in the U.S. for crossing chronic total occlusions in patients with symptomatic infrainguinal lower extremity vascular disease and with an intended use for ablating a channel in occlusive peripheral vascular disease. Our initial commercial strategy will focus on placing DABRA in office-based laboratories, or OBLs, and subsequently we intend to expand into the hospital catheterization market. Reimbursement claims for DABRA procedures are typically submitted by the provider to Medicare or another third-party payor using established Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, codes. DABRA was also granted CE mark approval in Europe in September 2016 for the endovascular treatment of infrainguinal arteries via atherectomy and for crossing total occlusions. As noted above, we are currently pursuing an atherectomy indication in the U.S.
 Pharos.    Pharos is our excimer laser device that emits highly concentrated ultraviolet light and is used as a tool in the treatment of dermatological skin disorders. Physicians use Pharos by applying 308 nanometer ultraviolet light to the skin. The FDA has granted 510(k) clearance to market Pharos in the U.S. for psoriasis, vitiligo, atopic dermatitis, and leukoderma. Pharos was granted CE mark approval in Europe in September of 2016 for use in the treatment of psoriasis, vitiligo, atopic dermatitis and leukoderma by the application of UVB ultraviolet light. We have also received clearance to market Pharos from the China Food and Drug Administration, or CFDA. We believe Pharos offers significant benefits to patients. The targeted nature of our treatment allows the operator to spare healthy tissue from exposure to the ultraviolet light making the treatment faster and safer than some other forms of phototherapy, or light therapy. For instance, Pharos is not contraindicated for children and pregnant women, allowing for their treatment. Treatment with Pharos differs from topical treatments, such as steroids and vitamin D derivatives, which may require frequent ongoing application. Treatment with Pharos also differs from pharmaceutical treatments, which may be associated with systemic side effects.
 Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disorder that causes cells to build up rapidly and affects the surface of the skin. The National Psoriasis Foundation reports that psoriasis affects more than 8 million people in the U.S. Psoriasis often develops between the ages of 15 to 35, but can develop at any age. Vitiligo is an autoimmune condition in which the skin turns white due to the loss of melanocytes, cells that produce the pigment melanin, which gives skin color. Vitiligo affects approximately 1% of the population globally. Atopic dermatitis, more commonly known as eczema, is a chronic eczematous skin disease. There are approximately 16.5 million adults in the U.S. suffering from atopic dermatitis, according to the National Eczema Association. Leukoderma is the localized loss of pigment in the skin due to several causes including vitiligo.
 Vascular Disease
 Vascular disease refers to diseases of the blood vessels located throughout the body. The most common cause of vascular disease is atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a progressive, degenerative condition in which plaque, consisting of lipids, cholesterol, calcium and other substances found in the blood stream, accumulates on the vascular wall. Plaque occurs in several different forms and may be located throughout the arterial system. Plaque varies in composition, with portions that are hard and brittle, referred to as calcified plaque, and other portions that are fatty or fibrous. Endovascular treatments for atherosclerosis are performed in a catheterization laboratory located in an OBL or hospital. These patients are diagnosed by their primary care physician, podiatrist, or other specialist, and then treatment is performed by an interventional cardiologist, interventional radiologist, or vascular surgeon.
 PAD is atherosclerosis of the extremities, most commonly in the legs. Smoking, genetic predisposition, diabetes, aging, and obesity may significantly increase the risk of developing PAD. Plaque build-up reduces blood-flow to the surrounding tissue, causing claudication, pain or cramping in the leg, the most common early symptom of PAD. Symptoms may progress to include numbness, tingling or weakness in the legs and, in severe cases, burning or aching pain in the feet or toes.
 As PAD progresses, additional symptoms may develop on the legs and feet, including cooling, color changes, or ulcers or wounds that do not heal. Left untreated, PAD can progress into critical limb ischemia, or CLI, the end stage of the disease where there is not enough oxygenated blood being delivered to the lower limbs to keep the tissue alive. As of June 2017, the SAGE Group reported that conservatively 22 to 30 million people suffer from CLI worldwide. If untreated, CLI may result in ulceration, infection, or gangrene in the feet and legs and eventually limb amputation or death.

Market Overview
 PAD affects approximately 17 million people in the U.S. However, only 20-30% of PAD patients are actively being treated. Despite its prevalence and poor outcomes, PAD is underdiagnosed and undertreated relative to many other serious vascular conditions, including CAD, in part because up to half of the PAD population is asymptomatic and many dismiss symptoms as normal signs of aging. 
 Without treatment, the disease can result in severe complications including amputation or death. The most common reason for amputation today is PAD. Despite the relative under diagnosis and treatment of PAD, the 2021 U.S. atherectomy market is projected to be over $750 million. Higher diagnosis and intervention rates resulting from greater physician and patient awareness of PAD, as well as higher prevalence, are helping drive the market opportunity for PAD treatments.
 We believe that the following factors are contributing to a growing diagnosed patient population:
  
• | Increased Awareness. Emphasis on PAD education from medical associations, insurance companies and online medical communities, as well as publication in medical journals is increasing public and physician awareness of PAD risk factors, symptoms and treatment options. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Evolving Physician Practice Patterns. Given that many patients with CAD also have PAD, we believe that interventional cardiologists and vascular surgeons are increasingly screening patients for both diseases. As a result, we believe that physicians are diagnosing more cases of PAD. In addition, we believe that heightened awareness of PAD, its symptoms and treatment options is leading to increased referrals. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conventional Means of Treatment and Their Limitations
 Physicians typically treat patients with mild to moderate PAD through non-invasive management, including exercise and prescription medication, and, if symptoms worsen, may recommend interventional or surgical procedures. Some patients who initially are diagnosed with severe PAD are treated immediately through interventional or surgical procedures.
 Non-Invasive Management.    For many diagnosed cases of PAD in the U.S., lifestyle changes, including improved diet, regular exercise and smoking cessation, as well as drug treatment are often prescribed. Although these measures can be effective, many people do not sustain them. In addition, these measures may reduce the symptoms, but do not treat the underlying causes of the disease. Physicians may also prescribe medications that lower cholesterol and reduce blood pressure. These drug therapies are generally prescribed for the life of the patient and do not treat the obstruction, making them an ineffective treatment for many patients. As a result, many of these patients will ultimately require more aggressive treatments.
 Interventional Procedures.    When PAD progresses beyond claudication, physicians may advise intervention, often beginning with minimally-invasive procedures. Minimally invasive endovascular treatments include balloon angioplasty, stents, and plaque removal devices. These treatments have limitations in their safety or efficacy profiles and frequently result in recurrence of the disease. Recent data supports that there are approximately 1 million annual endovascular procedures for the treatment of PAD in the U.S. Angioplasty and stenting are the most commonly performed minimally-invasive interventional treatments.

• | Angioplasty. In an angioplasty procedure, a long, thin tube, or catheter, with a balloon tip is inserted into the blocked or narrowed part of the artery over a previously positioned guidewire that directs the catheter to the affected area. The balloon is then inflated, compressing the plaque and stretching the arterial wall. While angioplasty catheters are relatively easy to use, they stretch the arterial wall, sometimes leading to dissections of, and damage to, the arterial walls. Angioplasty does not remove the plaque, which remains in the artery. In addition, traditional angioplasty is not well suited to treat highly calcified lesions, lesions concentrated on one side of the arterial wall, or lesions that occur at bifurcations, all common manifestations of PAD in the leg. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Drug Coated Balloon. Drug coated balloons (DCBs) are often used in conjunction with atherectomy. Drug coated balloon angioplasty is similar to a regular angioplasty procedure, but in this case the balloon catheter used has an anti-restenotic drug coating on the surface of balloon. When the balloon is inflated the drug is delivered to the vessel wall which may help prevent restenosis. Unlike regular 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

angioplasty, low pressures are generally used to inflate DCBs thereby reduced arterial wall stretch, dissections and damage to the arterial wall. However, the long-term safety and durability of DCB angioplasty remains uncertain, in particular in treating lesions below the knee.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cutting Balloon. A cutting balloon is a special balloon catheter which has small blades bonded along the length of the balloon. These devices were developed to overcome some of the limitations of regular angioplasty, namely the risk for dissection and vessel wall damage due to the dilating forces used with regular angioplasty balloons. When the balloon is inflated the dilating force is concentrated along the blades creating small, longitudinal incisions along the length of the vessel wall. Cutting balloons are commonly used as a vessel preparation tool in conjunction with a DCB or stenting, particularly in calcified lesions or for in-stent restenosis. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Intravascular Lithotripsy. Intravascular Lithotripsy is a calcium modification PTA balloon, designed for the treatment of moderately to severely calcified PAD lesions. The catheter delivers sonic pressure waves to target and disrupt calcium within the vessel. Once the calcium is cracked the balloon is inflated at low pressures to achieve lumen gain. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Stenting. Stenting is generally performed in tandem with angioplasty. A stent is a wire-mesh tube that acts as a scaffold inside the artery to keep it open. Stents are currently available in a wide range of varieties, including drug-coated stents. Despite their widespread use, stents may cause injury and inflammation to the arterial wall during placement and continued trauma post-procedure. Once a stent is implanted, it cannot be removed, which may limit future treatment options such as angioplasty, additional stenting, atherectomy and bypass. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Plaque Removal Devices. Procedures to remove plaque are often referred to in the medical field as atherectomy procedures. There are several types of atherectomy devices, including directional, rotational and laser, each with different mechanisms of action to remove plaque. Atherectomy treatments are frequently used with a stent or balloon. Atherectomy technologies can damage the vessel walls, which may increase the risk of restenosis. For example, cutting devices, such as directional or rotational devices, introduce significant mechanical trauma. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Surgical Procedures. Most PAD patients are treated endovascularly. Many of these patients, including diabetics, are not candidates for surgical procedures. However, surgery is used when non-invasive management or interventional procedures have failed or if the patient is diagnosed when PAD has progressed to an advanced state. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Bypass Surgery. More severe cases of PAD may be treated by surgeons with bypass surgery. The blood flow is diverted around the occluded area using a synthetic graft or harvested vessel. Bypass surgery is performed by physicians in an operating room with the patient under general anesthesia and requires multi-day hospital stays for healing and rehabilitation. General anesthesia and the potential for surgical infections make this approach less suitable for patients with conditions such as high blood pressure, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or poor kidney function. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Amputation. CLI is a serious form of PAD caused by severe lack of blood flow to the legs. Physicians may recommend full or partial amputation of the leg or foot for patients with CLI. Approximately 200,000 amputations occur annually in the U.S. as a result of PAD.

Our Solution
 Strengths of Our Approach
 DABRA includes a portable excimer laser system combined with proprietary, single-use catheters that together represent a competitive plaque removal solution for the minimally invasive endovascular treatment of blockages in the vasculature. DABRA represents a novel approach to the treatment of a broad range of vascular blockages that is safe and effective, easy to use, and competitively priced. We believe that the principal benefits of DABRA are:

• | Safety. DABRA is designed to track the patient’s true lumen, or the center of the artery, and not to penetrate between the layers of arterial structure known as the subintimal space. Damage or stretching of the arterial walls, which can lead to dissection or perforation, may be reduced. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Efficacy. Unlike many treatments for PAD that do not remove plaque, DABRA employs photoablation to disintegrate plaque by breaking its chemical bonds, thereby reducing the plaque to the components of its fundamental chemistry without generating potentially harmful particulates. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Utility. DABRA enables physicians to remove plaque from long and calcified lesions in arteries located in the lower extremities both above- and below-the-knee. DABRA is able to cross and debulk a wide variety of plaque, removing vascular blockages. For example, in patients with a CTO, the physician may use DABRA to cross the CTO prior to alternative treatments consisting of balloon angioplasty and possibly stenting. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ease of Use. DABRA employs techniques similar to those used in angioplasty, which are familiar to the approximately 10,000 interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists in the U.S. who are generally trained in endovascular techniques. In order to further the ease of use for physicians, we are working towards increasing the robustness of our catheter via a braided overjacket, or a similar design, to make the catheter more kink-resistant when navigating tortuous anatomy. We are also working on developing a version of the DABRA catheter that is compatible with a standard guidewire. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cost and Time Efficient. When we relaunch DABRA, we intend to price our single-use catheters competitively and provide the DABRA laser system for a nominal periodic fee without requiring the purchase of capital equipment, which we believe will make DABRA a cost-effective solution for providers. The average lasing time in our pivotal study was approximately two and a half minutes per procedure. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strategy
 Our goal is to become the leading medical device company marketing excimer lasers as tools for the treatment of endovascular diseases. Key components of our strategy to achieve this goal are:

• | Increasing the shelf life and improving the consistency of the DABRA catheter. In the third quarter of 2019, we engaged in a voluntary recall of the catheters with a 12-month shelf life to replace them with catheters with a two-month shelf life. We have identified current limitations on shelf life relating to aspects of the fluid core and coating and are currently implementing multiple remediations to address these issues. Our initial internal accelerated aging test data supports shelf life for our catheter of at least six months.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Product enhancements. We are working on two important design changes to the DABRA catheter. First, we are increasing the robustness of our catheter via a braided overjacket, or a similar design, to make the catheter more kink-resistant when navigating tortuous anatomy. Second, we are developing a version of the DABRA catheter that is compatible with a standard guidewire. Following these two enhancements, we intend to develop a larger diameter catheter to target atherectomy procedures in the larger vessels more commonly seen in above-the-knee procedures.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Atherectomy indication for use. We are currently pursuing an atherectomy indication for use, which the FDA defines to include a prespecified improvement in luminal patency. To satisfy the FDA’s data requirements to support an atherectomy indication, we are performing a pivotal study designed to allow the FDA to evaluate the use of DABRA in atherectomy procedures. We received an IDE approval in January 2020 and the study is approved for up to 10 clinical sites and 100 subjects. We enrolled the first

subject in February 2020. Throughout much of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic substantially impacted our ability to activate new sites and enroll additional subjects. Many sites or potential sites have been or are currently operating at a reduced capacity, and some have been closed from time to time. In addition, potential study subjects may voluntarily opt to postpone their procedures due to COVID-19 concerns. As of March 11, 2021, five sites have been cleared to enroll subjects and 30 subjects have been enrolled in the trial. Due to the unpredictable impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had and will continue to have on enrollment in this study, we currently cannot estimate when enrollment will be completed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expanding DABRA sales. We do not anticipate rebuilding our vascular sales team until most of our engineering projects are complete and we have a more definitive timeline for obtaining an atherectomy indication.

Products
 The DABRA Product
 DABRA combines a portable excimer laser console with proprietary, single-use catheters for the minimally invasive endovascular treatment of vascular blockages resulting from lower extremity vascular disease in both above- and below-the-knee lesions. We have significant expertise in excimer lasers gained from over a decade developing, manufacturing, testing, marketing, and servicing the Pharos excimer laser for dermatological diseases, and have leveraged this expertise in the design, development and manufacturing of DABRA.
 The most important aspect of DABRA for the vascular market is the catheter, which transmits energy from the laser to the vascular blockage. The laser energy travels through the catheter and ablates the blockage, reducing it to chemicals that are found naturally in the bloodstream. The catheters are sterilized single-use only and specifically designed for our laser-based systems. The DABRA catheter uses a liquid-filled plastic tubing allowing for the efficient and precise delivery of the laser energy.
 The DABRA catheter is a single-use, 5 French gauge catheter that currently does not use a guidewire to navigate vasculature and that typically stays within the normal area in which blood is flowing or true lumen, even while crossing blockages. It is a full aperture ratio forward cutter, delivering fast ablation of a wide variety of plaque, without the “dead-space” of fiber optic bundle catheters. It produces a high quality lumen while minimizing trauma to the vasculature. The DABRA catheter has a 1.5 millimeter blunt-tip design and a working length of 150 cm that tracks the true lumen, navigating the vascular curves. DABRA catheters have been used with a variety of introducers and guide catheters. They have been used in both above- and below-the-knee procedures, including axially, femorally, both antegrade and retrograde, from popliteal access and pedal access, both anterior tibial and posterior tibial. DABRA removes plaque by photoablation.
 The DABRA excimer laser is the power source for DABRA catheters that generates a laser light by a software controlled 308 nanometer excimer laser source that produces 308 nanometer ultraviolet-B photons that are directed to the catheter through a lens to photoablate vascular blockages, reducing calcium, thrombus, and atheroma into their fundamental chemistry, minimizing downstream debris.

DABRA ablation produces fast treatment times and minimizes fluoroscopy time. The laser is small enough for most catheterization laboratories, weighs approximately 180 pounds, (including a gas bottle), and is easily portable around and between rooms. It is easy-to-use, features a simple and intuitive operator-interface, plugs into a standard 110-volt outlet, and does not require any pumps or fluids.

The DABRA Procedure
 During the procedure, the physician inserts the proximal end of the single-use DABRA catheter into the laser console. Using the buttons next to the screen of the console, the physician enters the calibration mode and inserts the distal end of the catheter into the calibration port of the console to perform the calibration. The physician sets the treatment settings on the touch screen. The physician then inserts the catheter into the support catheter and under fluoroscope, advances the catheter to the target lesion. The physician uses the footswitch to activate the laser unit and slowly advances the catheter to ablate the target lesion.
 Depending upon the type of lesion, DABRA can cross blockages at a rate of up to one centimeter per second. The DABRA procedure is typically performed under local anesthesia in a catheterization laboratory. A patient treated in an OBL is discharged the same day.
 

Clinical Studies and Patient Data
 Pre-Marketing Studies.    We applied and received FDA IDE approval for our pivotal study. It was a non-randomized, single-arm, prospective, multi-site study that enrolled 64 subjects at four sites. The objective of the study was to evaluate plaque photoablation using DABRA in the endovascular treatment resulting from lower extremity vascular disease of patients with Rutherford categories 3, 4, 5 and 6. The primary efficacy endpoint was the successful crossing of the target lesion based on angiographic analysis at time of the procedure. The safety endpoint was device-related major adverse events at the time of the procedure. It was conducted at four centers including the California Heart and Vascular Center, an OBL in El Centro, California, Centro Medico Excel, a hospital in Tijuana, Mexico, the University of California, San Diego, a major teaching hospital in San Diego, California, and Merit Health Wesley, a hospital in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. As part of the inclusion criteria for the DABRA study, the target blockage must have been refractory to guidewire crossing. The average lasing time in our study was approximately two and a half minutes and the average lesion measured over seven centimeters, which is representative of a typical patient suffering from severe lower extremity vascular disease. The analyses pre- and post-treatment were performed using standard angiographic and ultrasonic tools which are commonly used in commercial catheterization laboratories.
 The study was closed to enrollment on May 24, 2017 when we received 510(k) clearance for DABRA. 50 subjects were included in the FDA’s data used to determine the 510(k) clearance. The final study results demonstrated 94% effectiveness with 0% reported device-related SAEs, both related to the 50 subjects included in the data submitted to the FDA and the 64 patients enrolled in the study. Furthermore, in our study, 64 lesions crossed were above the knee, or approximately 85%, and 11 lesions crossed were below-the-knee, or approximately 15%. 
 
Atherectomy Study.     In January 2020, we received final IDE approval to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the DABRA laser system for use as an atherectomy device for the treatment of peripheral vascular stenoses.  
 13


The multicenter, open-label trial will enroll up to 100 patients with symptoms of PAD (Rutherford Class 2-4). Outcome measures include safety, acute technical success and clinical success. The trial’s primary efficacy endpoint is the mean reduction in percent diameter stenosis in each patient’s primary lesion as measured by angiography immediately following treatment with DABRA, before any adjunctive treatment. Major adverse events at 30 days and incidence of primary target lesion revascularization (TLR) at six months will be the safety and clinical success endpoints.  
 The Pharos Product
 Pharos is a powerful, monochromatic, or single-wavelength, xenon-chlorine, 308 nanometer ultraviolet-B excimer laser used by physicians as a tool to treat chronic skin diseases, including psoriasis, vitiligo, atopic dermatitis, and leukoderma. We launched Pharos in 2004. Pharos does not use heat and does not ablate lesions, and treatments are generally painless. Pharos’ proprietary hand piece features an integrated adjustable spot size and aiming beam that accurately targets only the diseased tissue while sparing the healthy skin from exposure. The laser beam is easily contoured to accommodate the shape of the lesion for fast and precisely targeted treatments with constant fluence, or stream of photons crossing a unit area. No templates or attachments are required. Its flat-top, no hot-spot beam profile delivers uniform dosing for optimal results. Pharos is small enough for most treatment rooms, intuitive to use, and uses a standard 110-volt outlet. In the third quarter of 2019, we launched Pharos Optimized, which includes faster treatments and extended peak performance.
The Pharos Laser
 The Pharos treatment is generally performed in a dermatology treatment room in an office, clinic or hospital. In most states and countries in which we have received regulatory approval, the treatment can be applied by a nurse or technician. The laser is calibrated, the desired dose is entered, and the hand piece is directed to the patient. The treatment is delivered through a hand piece that has a distance gauge which is placed on the patients’ skin and is operated by a foot switch. The hand piece is moved to the appropriate lesion location and the process is repeated until all of the lesions have been dosed.
 We believe that the principal benefits of Pharos are:
  
• | Wavelength. Studies have shown that the action spectrum, or the rate of a physiological activity plotted against wavelength of light, for immunologically modulated skin disorders is centered at about 308 nanometers. Pharos is a 308 nanometer laser, making it ideally suited for use as a tool in the treatment of these disorders. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 14


 
• | Energy. The energy from excimer lasers has been shown, in both in vivo and in vitro studies, to have almost four times the T-cell apoptosis generation than non-laser sources. Pharos is a pulsed laser capable of producing very high peak powers. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Collimation. Ultraviolet-B light has a very shallow penetration into the skin, typically less than 100 microns. Although the skin tends to scatter the light, collimation, or keeping the light rays parallel, helps prevent reflection and improves the dose delivery. Pharos has a moderately collimated beam and this collimation allows for treatment in intertriginous areas, such as the groin and armpits, and mucosal areas, such as the mouth and ears, without compromising dose. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Targeting. Applying the laser energy only to the diseased tissue not only spares the healthy tissue from exposure, but also allows the operator to increase the dose to the affected areas. We believe that Pharos is the only system that has an integrated adjustable spot size offering continuous beam adjustment from a large square to a small circle. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Footprint. Dermatological treatment rooms are small and often crowded with other equipment. Pharos has a small footprint and is among the lightest excimer lasers currently marketed, allowing physicians to conserve space and easily move the system. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There are essentially three main types of current treatments for dermatological skin disorders, which each have limitations, as listed below:
  
• | Topical therapies. These can include corticosteroids, vitamin D3 derivatives, coal tar, anthralin and retinoids, among others, that are sold as a cream, gel, liquid, spray, or ointment. The efficacy of topical agents varies from person to person, and these products are commonly associated with poor compliance or side effects that include irritation, redness, and thinning of the skin. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phototherapy. There are several ultraviolet lamp systems that deliver ultraviolet-A and ultraviolet-B light for the treatment of skin conditions. Broadband ultraviolet therapy can be less desirable than targeted laser machines due to exposure of non-diseased skin and limited ability to deliver high intensity light, requiring more treatment sessions and increasing cancer risk. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Systemic medications including biologics. There are a number of prescription medications available, which are delivered orally or by injection. Generally, these drugs are administered only after both topical treatments and phototherapy have failed, or for people who have severe disease. Some of the side effects include risks of infection or death. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dermatological Disease
 Dermatological disease refers to diseases of the skin caused by imbalance in the physiological condition of the skin. There are over 3,000 different skin conditions and diseases, including psoriasis, vitiligo, and atopic dermatitis. Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disorder that causes cells to rapidly accumulate and affects the surface of the skin. The extra skin cells form scales and red patches, or flares, which are itchy and sometimes painful. There is no known cure and multiple rounds of treatments are required to bring the disease under control. Vitiligo is an autoimmune condition causing the skin to turn white due to the loss of pigment from the melanocytes, cells that produce the pigment melanin, which gives skin color. There is no known cure. However, some medical treatments can reduce the severity of the condition. Atopic dermatitis, a chronic eczematous skin disease, can result in itchy, red, swollen, and cracked skin.
 Additional proliferative skin disorders include alopecia areata, dyshidrotic eczema, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or CTCL. Alopecia areata is a condition in which hair is lost from some or all areas of the body. Dyshidrotic eczema is a skin disease characterized by itchy blisters on the palms of the hands and bottoms of the feet. CTCL is a type of cancer of the immune system caused by a mutation of T-cells.
 Market Overview
 Psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and vitiligo are common skin disorders throughout the world. The National Psoriasis Foundation reports that psoriasis affects over 8 million people in the U.S. Globally, this skin condition is estimated to affect over 125 million people, 2-3% of the total population. A study on the economic costs of psoriasis, including direct costs (medical expenses), indirect costs (work productivity), quality of life costs, and comorbidity costs, showed an estimated $135 billion annual expense for everyone with psoriasis in the United 
 15


States. The study found that the majority of psoriasis patients miss an average of 26 days of work a year due to their disease. Currently, more than 18 million adults suffer from atopic dermatitis in the U.S., making it one of the most common inflammatory skin diseases. Vitiligo is a pigmentation disorder that affects approximately 1% of the population globally.
 Customers
 No single customer represented more than 10% of our total revenue for 2020 or 2019.
 Sales and Marketing
 We market and sell Pharos primarily through our direct sales force in the U.S. and we partner with distributors in select geographies outside of the U.S. We are supplying DABRA catheters to those sites involved in our atherectomy clinical study. We have paused shipments of catheters to commercial sites while we conduct further studies on the stability of our shelf life. We submitted additional test data in March 2021, which will need to be cleared by the FDA prior to resuming commercial shipments of catheters. We do not anticipate rebuilding our vascular sales and marketing team until most of our engineering projects are complete and we have a more definitive timeline for obtaining an atherectomy indication.
 Our Pharos marketing program focuses on:
  
• | educating physicians regarding the proper use and application of our products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | supporting physicians’ efforts to enhance referral opportunities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | improving patient and caregiver awareness of our treatments; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | facilitating national and international marketing programs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------

 We use a targeted marketing approach to introduce our products to the medical marketplace. We primarily target our marketing efforts to practitioners through marketing materials, medical conferences and journals. In addition, we host seminars and webinars where industry leaders discuss case studies and treatment techniques using our products.
 Manufacturing
 We manufacture our excimer lasers and catheters in our approximately 32,000 square foot facility located in Carlsbad, California. Our vertically integrated facility is ISO 13485 certified and is licensed by the state of California to manufacture our sterile single-use catheters in our controlled environments. We specify and source our supplies primarily from U.S.-based manufacturers, contracting with local suppliers to manufacture custom components. We carefully choose our suppliers to ensure that all components meet our quality standards, adhere to all applicable regulations, and meet our supply needs. We inspect, test, and assemble our products under strict manufacturing processes supported by internal policies and procedures. We perform our own final quality control testing of all products before shipment. In addition to primary suppliers, secondary suppliers have been identified for contingency planning purposes for many key components. We audit our suppliers as required by our quality system and the FDA. We believe that our current manufacturing capacity is sufficient to produce enough lasers and catheters to meet our current expected demand for the foreseeable future.
Competition
 The medical device industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants. We face potential competition from major medical device companies worldwide, many of which have longer, more established operating histories, and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, distribution, and other resources. Our competitors also include pharmaceutical companies that manufacture drugs for the treatment of psoriasis, vitiligo, atopic dermatitis, leukoderma or other dermatological diseases. Our overall competitive position is dependent upon a number of factors, including product performance and reliability, manufacturing cost, and customer support.
 Vascular blockages are currently treated with angioplasty balloons, stents, and atherectomy devices that include excimer laser ablation. Our major competitors for our vascular solutions include Medtronic plc, Cardiovascular Systems Inc., Boston Scientific Corp., Avinger, Inc., Koninklijke Philips N.V., including Volcano Corporation and Spectranetics Corporation, Becton Dickinson and Company, including products from the C.R. Bard 
 16


acquisition, AngioDynamics and Abbott Laboratories. We believe that DABRA competes favorably with our competitors’ products in terms of safety, ease of use, utility, and cost.
 Dermatological diseases are currently treated with phototherapy, topical therapies, and systemic medications. Our major competitors for our dermatological solutions include The Daavlin Company, National Biological Corp., STRATA Skin Sciences and large pharmaceutical companies producing biologics. We believe Pharos competes favorably with our competitors’ products.
 Reimbursement
 Our customers do not receive reimbursement for the purchase of our products. However, procedures performed using DABRA and Pharos are typically reimbursable using existing CPT codes. At this time we believe that the existing CPT codes are generally adequate to describe the procedures using our products. We believe that there is no current need to apply for separate product specific CPT codes and we recognize that the existence of codes does not guarantee coverage or reimbursement. The CPT process is dynamic and changes or interpretations of codes can occur yearly. Sales of DABRA and Pharos in the U.S. depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement to our customers for use of our products from third-party payors, such as private health insurers, managed care organizations and government health programs, like Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Medicare’s coverage and reimbursement policies are significant to our operations, as a large percentage of DABRA and Pharos procedure patients are Medicare beneficiaries, and private third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage and reimbursement policies in setting their own payment policies. However, no uniform coverage or reimbursement policies for services using our products exist among third-party payors in the U.S. Changes in FDA regulatory status, clinical trials, and expanded indications can also have a bearing on coverage and reimbursement. The absence of uniform policies and limits on coverage can create barriers to sale. You should refer to the “Risk factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for risks related to reimbursement.  
 Market acceptance of the DABRA and Pharos devices is dependent on adequate payment levels from third-party payors to our customers. We receive payment from the provider, facility or other entity that purchases, leases, rents or uses the DABRA or Pharos devices and purchases related supplies. A physician who performs a procedure utilizing either device may be reimbursed separately from a hospital by third-party payors. Under Medicare, the physician would be reimbursed according to the physician fee schedule in effect at the time of the procedure. The physician fee schedule also applies when the procedure is performed in a free-standing OBL catheterization laboratory. When the procedure is performed in a hospital outpatient setting, the hospital would be reimbursed according to the outpatient hospital prospective payment system, based on ambulatory payment classification groups. Under Medicare, the physician fee schedule and outpatient hospital prospective payment amounts can change every year and may decline.
 Reimbursement to facilities and physicians can vary substantially depending on the third-party payors’ coverage and reimbursement policies and other factors. For example, the type and geographical location of the facility in which the procedure was performed may impact the level of reimbursement. In addition, the specific use of the product may impact reimbursement. For example, the laser treatment of psoriasis is reimbursable by Medicare and nearly all major insurance companies under three CPT codes that are available for Pharos procedures. These codes and the corresponding payment levels differ based on the size of the affected area to be treated. As a result, there is wide variability in reimbursement, and third-party payor’s reimbursement policies are subject to change. Further, requests for reimbursement are subject to challenge, reduction or denial by third-party payors. In order to better manage the changing reimbursement environment, we have centralized our internal reimbursement resources.
 Research and Development
 The major focus of our research and development team is to leverage our existing technology platform for new applications and improvements to our existing applications, including multiple engineering efforts to improve our current catheter. Future research and development efforts will involve continued enhancements to and cost reductions for DABRA and Pharos. We will also explore the development of other products that can be derived from our core technology platform and intellectual property. Our research and development team works together with our commercial team to set development priorities based on communicated customer needs. The feedback received from our customers is reviewed and evaluated for incorporation into new products. We recognized $9.0 million and $4.5 million of research and development expenses in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

We protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 United States
 In the U.S., medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations, and certain other federal and state statutes and regulations. The laws and regulations govern, among other things, the design, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion, post-approval monitoring and reporting, distribution and import and export of medical devices. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject a device and/or its manufacturer to a variety of administrative sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending pre-market approval applications, or PMAs, issuance of warning letters or untitled letters, mandatory product recalls, import detentions, civil monetary penalties, and/or judicial sanctions, such as product seizures, injunctions, and criminal prosecution.
 The FDCA classifies medical devices into one of three categories based on the risks associated with the device and the level of control necessary to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are deemed to be low risk and are subject to the fewest regulatory controls. Class II devices provide intermediate levels of risk. They are subject to general controls, and some Class II devices must also comply with special controls. Class III devices are generally the highest risk devices and are subject to the highest level of regulatory control to provide reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness. Class III devices must typically be approved by the FDA before they are marketed. Both DABRA and Pharos are Class II devices.
 Generally, establishments that manufacture devices are required to register their establishments with the FDA and provide the FDA a list of the devices that they handle at their facilities.
 18


The FDA enforces these requirements by market surveillance and periodic visits, both announced and unannounced, to inspect or re-inspect equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes to confirm regulatory compliance. These inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of subcontractors. Following an inspection, the FDA may issue a report, known as a Form 483, listing instances where the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures or, if observed violations are severe and urgent, a warning letter. If the manufacturer does not adequately respond to a Form 483 or warning letter, the FDA make take enforcement action against the manufacturer or impose other sanctions or consequences, which may include: 
  
• | cease and desist orders;
--+-------------------------


• | injunctions, or consent decrees;
--+---------------------------------


• | civil monetary penalties;
--+--------------------------


• | recall, detention or seizure of our products;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | operating restrictions, partial or total shutdown of production facilities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of or delay in granting requests for 510(k) clearance, de novo classification, or premarket approval of new products or modified products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | withdrawing 510(k) clearances, de novo classifications, or premarket approvals that are already granted;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal to grant export approval or export certificates for devices; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

Pre-market Authorization and Notification
 While most Class I and some Class II devices can be marketed without prior FDA authorization, most medical devices can be legally sold within the U.S. only if the FDA has: (i) approved a pre-market approval, or PMA, application prior to marketing, generally applicable to most Class III devices; (ii) cleared the device in response to a premarket notification, or 510(k) submission, generally applicable to Class I and II devices; or (iii) authorized the device to be marketed through the de novo process, generally applicable for novel Class I or II devices. Some devices that have been classified as Class III are regulated pursuant to the 510(k) requirements because the FDA has not yet called for PMAs for these devices.
510(k) Notification
 Product marketing in the U.S. for most Class II and limited Class I devices typically follows a 510(k) pathway. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, referred to as the predicate device. A predicate device may be a previously 510(k) cleared device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for submission of PMA applications, or a product previously granted de novo authorization. The manufacturer must show that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and it either has the same technological characteristics, or it is shown to be equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate device.
 There are three types of 510(k)s: traditional; special, for certain device modifications; and abbreviated, for devices that conform to a recognized standard. The special and abbreviated 510(k)s are intended to streamline review. The FDA intends to process special 510(k)s within 30 days of receipt, and abbreviated 510(k)s within 90 days of receipt. Though the FDA has a user fee goal to clear a traditional 510(k) within 90 days of receipt, the clearance pathway for traditional 510(k)s can take substantially longer.
 After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s decision not to seek a new 510(k) clearance for the modified device, the agency may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. The FDA also can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained.
 19


We have received 510(k) premarket clearances from the FDA to market our excimer laser and catheter systems for treatment of psoriasis, vitiligo, atopic dermatitis, leukoderma, and for crossing chronic total occlusions in patients with symptomatic infrainguinal lower extremity vascular disease and with an intended use for ablating a channel in occlusive peripheral vascular disease.
 De Novo Classification
 Devices of a new type that the FDA has not previously classified based on risk are automatically classified into Class III by operation of section 513(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, regardless of the level of risk they pose. To avoid requiring PMA review of low- to moderate-risk devices classified in Class III by operation of law, Congress enacted section 513(f)(2) of the FDCA. This provision allows the FDA to classify a low- to moderate-risk device not previously classified into Class I or II through the de novo classification pathway. The FDA evaluates the safety and effectiveness of devices submitted for review under the de novo classification pathway and devices determined to be Class II through this pathway can serve as predicate devices for future 510(k) applicants. The de novo classification pathway can require clinical data and is generally more burdensome than the 510(k) pathway and less burdensome than the PMA approval pathway.
 PMA Approval
 A product not eligible for 510(k) clearance or de novo classification must follow the PMA approval pathway, which requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s satisfaction.
 Results from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials are required to establish the safety and effectiveness of a Class III PMA device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. After completion of the required clinical testing, a PMA including the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing, and information relating to the product’s marketing history, design, labeling, manufacture, and controls, is prepared and submitted to the FDA.
 The PMA approval process is generally more expensive, rigorous, lengthy, and uncertain than the 510(k) premarket notification process and de novo classification process and requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s satisfaction. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with Quality System Regulation, or QSR, requirements, which impose elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. The FDA’s review of a PMA application typically takes one to three years, but may last longer. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the manufacturer. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including the loss or withdrawal of the approval and/or placement of restrictions on the sale of the device until the conditions are satisfied.
 Even after approval of a PMA, a new PMA or PMA supplement may be required in the event of a modification to the device, its labeling or its manufacturing process. Supplements to a PMA often require the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA, except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the product covered by the original PMA.
 Clinical Trials
 A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application and de novo classification and is sometimes required for a premarket notification. For significant risk devices, the FDA regulations require that human clinical investigations conducted in the U.S. be approved under an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence. A nonsignificant risk device does not require FDA approval of an IDE. In some cases, one or more smaller IDE studies may precede a pivotal clinical trial intended to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the investigational device. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IDE is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA disapproves the IDE within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IDE may not begin.
 20


An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must also include a description of product manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. The FDA typically grants IDE approval for a specified number of patients to be treated at specified study centers. During the study, the sponsor must comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements for investigator selection, trial monitoring, reporting, and record keeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices, and comply with reporting and record keeping requirements. Prior to granting PMA approval, the FDA typically inspects the records relating to the conduct of the study and the clinical data supporting the PMA application for compliance with IDE requirements.
 Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard intended to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, investigators, and monitors; and (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Clinical trials are typically conducted at geographically diverse clinical trial sites, and are designed to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the device and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the device when considering whether a device satisfies the statutory standard for commercialized. Clinical trials, for significant and nonsignificant risk devices, must be approved by an institutional review board, or IRB – an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review and monitor biomedical research involving human subjects and which has the authority to approve, require modifications in, or disapprove research to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of the human research subject.
 The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with the FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. An IRB may also require the clinical trial it has approved to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions or sanctions.
 Although the QSR does not fully apply to investigational devices, the requirement for controls on design and development does apply. The sponsor also must manufacture the investigational device in conformity with the quality controls described in the IDE application and any conditions of IDE approval that the FDA may impose with respect to manufacturing. Investigational devices may only be distributed for use in an investigation, and must bear a label with the statement: “CAUTION—Investigational device. Limited by Federal law to investigational use.”
 Postmarket Requirements
 After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: the QSR, labeling regulations, the medical device reporting regulations (which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur), and reports of corrections and removals regulations (which require manufacturers to report recalls or removals and field corrections to the FDA if initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA). After a May 2018 inspection, the FDA issued to us a Form 483 that included observations for failure to properly evaluate whether certain complaints related to Pharos and DABRA that we have received rose to a level required to be reported to the FDA. In response, we informed the FDA that we have modified our complaint review procedures and we completed a retrospective evaluation and have not found any complaints which require a submission to the FDA. In connection with our Audit Committee investigation, the Audit Committee also found failures to properly identify reportable events or to file timely reports, as well as failure to address each of the observations to FDA’s satisfaction. In addition, the FDA conducted an unannounced facility inspection in December 2019. The FDA issued to us a Form 483 that included observations that schedules for the adjustment, cleaning, and other maintenance of equipment have not been adequately established, a device master record index was not current, and document control procedures have not been fully established. All actions are complete and the final Form 483 report was sent to the FDA on September 25, 2020. Failure to properly identify reportable events or to file timely reports, as well as failure to address each of the observations to FDA’s satisfaction, can subject us to warning letters, recalls, or other sanctions and penalties.

Advertising, marketing and promotional activities for devices are also subject to FDA oversight and must comply with the statutory standards of the FDCA, and the FDA’s implementing regulations. The FDA’s oversight authority review of marketing and promotional activities encompasses, but is not limited to, direct-to-consumer advertising, healthcare provider-directed advertising and promotion, sales representative communications to healthcare professionals, promotional programming and promotional activities involving electronic media. The FDA also regulates industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities that make representations regarding product safety or efficacy in a promotional context.   
 Manufacturers of medical devices are permitted to promote products solely for the uses and indications set forth in the approved or cleared product labeling. A number of enforcement actions have been taken against manufacturers that promote products for “off-label” uses (i.e., uses that are not described in the approved or cleared labeling), including actions alleging that claims submitted to government healthcare programs for reimbursement of products that were promoted for “off-label” uses are fraudulent in violation of the Federal False Claims Act or other federal and state statutes and that the submission of those claims was caused by off-label promotion. The failure to comply with prohibitions on “off-label” promotion can result in significant monetary penalties, revocation or suspension of a company’s business license, suspension of sales of certain products, product recalls, civil or criminal sanctions, exclusion from participating in federal healthcare programs, or other enforcement actions. In the United States, allegations of such wrongful conduct could also result in a corporate integrity agreement with the U.S. government that imposes significant administrative obligations and costs.  
 Violations of the FDCA relating to the inappropriate promotion of approved products may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and other laws, as well as state consumer protection laws.
 For a PMA or Class II 510(k) or de novo devices, the FDA also may require post-marketing testing, surveillance, or other measures to monitor the effects of an approved or cleared product. The FDA may place conditions on a PMA-approved device that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality-control, manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to QSRs after approval and clearance, and manufacturers are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with QSRs. The FDA may withdraw product approvals or recommend or require product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory requirements. 
 Radiation Emitting Products
 The FDA regulates radiation emitting electronic products even when they are not intended to be used for medical purposes. X-rays, microwaves, radio waves, laser, visible light, sound, ultrasound, and ultraviolet light are a few examples of the many types of radiation that may be produced by an electronic product. Diagnostic X-ray systems, laser products, laser light shows, and microwave ovens are a few examples out of the many different electronic products that emit radiation subject to FDA regulation. Many radiation emitting electronic products are also medical devices. In those cases, the products must comply with two independent sets of regulations—radiation safety regulations that apply to radiation emitting electronic products, as well as medical device regulations that apply to all medical devices.
 Under the Electronic Product Radiation Control provisions of the FDCA, the FDA has established regulations specifying electronic product performance standards covering several varieties of radiation emitting electronic products. Companies that manufacture or import electronic products subject to an FDA performance standard are required to submit various electronic product reports to the FDA to demonstrate that their products comply with the standard. Unless exempted by the radiation safety regulations, a manufacturer or importer must also submit to the FDA follow-up reports for product updates or modifications, as well as an annual report for their radiation emitting electronic products. The radiation safety regulations provide specific certification and labeling requirements for electronic products. Labeling, which includes user manuals, must contain certain information, such as warnings, declarations and clear and concise instructions for use and service. The information must also be formatted in accordance with the regulations. The law and applicable federal regulations also require laser manufacturers to maintain manufacturing, testing and sales records, and report product defects. Various warning labels must be affixed and certain protective devices installed, depending on the class of the product.
 22


Non U.S. Regulatory
 International sales of medical devices are also subject to the regulatory requirements of each country in which the devices are commercialized. The international regulatory review process varies from country to country and authorization from one country to market a device does not guarantee that other countries will also grant marketing authorization. In China, the State Food and Drug Administration, or SFDA, is the agency primarily responsible for regulating medical devices. We have clearances from China, from both the SFDA and the China Food and Drug Administration, or CFDA. In Europe, the regulations of the European Union require that a medical device be granted a CE Mark indicating conformance with European Union laws and regulations before it can be sold in that market. We received a CE mark for the Pharos dermatological and DABRA vascular system in the third quarter of 2016, enabling our product launch in Europe. 
 Other Healthcare Laws
 Our business operations and current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, consultants, customers and patients, expose us to broadly applicable state, federal, and foreign fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. These laws constrain the business and financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations, including how we research, market, sell and distribute our products. Such laws include, but are not limited to:

• | the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a U.S. healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | U.S. federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which, among other things, impose criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the U.S. government, claims for payment or approval that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. government. Persons and entities can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement, in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the health care fraud statute implemented under HIPAA or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | in addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization by covered entities subject to the rule, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers as well as their business associates that perform certain services for or on their behalf involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | the U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the government information related to payments or other “transfers of value” made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to the government ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members. Effective January 2022, we will also be required to collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | analogous state and non-U.S. laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to our business practices, including, but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by the patients themselves; state laws that require pharmaceutical and device companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information; and state and non-U.S. laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In particular, activities and arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, waste and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of activities or other arrangements related to the development, marketing or promotion of products, including pricing and discounting of products, provision of customer incentives, provision of reimbursement support, other customer support services, provision of sales commissions or other incentives to employees and independent contractors and other interactions with healthcare practitioners, other healthcare providers and patients. 
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrow scope of the statutory or regulatory exceptions and safe harbors available, our business activities could be challenged under one or more of these laws. Relationships between medical product manufacturers and health care providers are an area of heightened scrutiny by the government. We engage in various activities, including the conduct of speaker programs to educate physicians, the provision of reimbursement advice and support to customers, and the provision of customer and patient support services, that have been the subject of government scrutiny and enforcement action within the medical device industry. 
 Government expectations and industry best practices for compliance continue to evolve and past activities may not always be consistent with current industry best practices. Further, there is a lack of government guidance as to whether various industry practices comply with these laws, and government interpretations of these laws continue to evolve, all of which creates compliance uncertainties. Any non-compliance could result in regulatory sanctions, criminal or civil liability and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in preventing such conduct, mitigating risks, or reducing the chance of governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. 
 If a government entity opens an investigation into possible violations of any of these laws (which may include the issuance of subpoenas), we would have to expend significant resources to defend ourselves against the allegations. Defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired. If any of the above occur, it could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 24


Allegations that we, our officers, or our employees violated any one of these laws can be made by individuals called “whistleblowers” who may be our employees, customers, competitors or other parties. Government policy is to encourage individuals to become whistleblowers and file a complaint in federal court alleging wrongful conduct. The government is required to investigate all of these complaints and decide whether to intervene. If the government intervenes and we are required to pay money back to the government as a result of a settlement or judgement, the whistleblower, as a reward, is awarded a percentage. If the government declines to intervene, the whistleblower may proceed on his or her own and, if successful, he or she will receive a percentage of any judgment or settlement amount the company is required to pay. The government may also initiate an investigation on its own. If any such actions are instituted against us, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines, and other sanctions that may materially impair our ability to run a profitable business. In particular, if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or if we agree to settle with the government without admitting to any wrongful conduct or if we are found to be in violation of any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we, our officers and employees may be subject to sanctions, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in government health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations and the imposition of a corporate integrity agreement, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, generally prohibit businesses and their representatives from offering to pay, paying, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to a foreign official in order to influence any act or decision of the foreign official in his or her official capacity or to secure any other improper advantage in order to obtain or retain business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records, which in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. 
 We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. There is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA or other violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment, and loss of reputation, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 Privacy and Data Protection Laws
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, and the regulations that have been issued under it, impose certain obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of protected health information. The requirements and restrictions apply to “covered entities” (which include health care providers and insurers) as well as to their business associates that receive protected health information from them in order to provide services to or perform certain activities on their behalf. The statute and regulations also impose notification obligations on covered entities and their business associates in the event of a breach of the privacy or security of protected health information. We occasionally receive protected health information from our customers in the course of our business. As such, we believe that we are business associates and therefore subject to HIPAA’s requirements and restrictions with respect to handling such protected health information, and have executed business associate agreements with certain customers. 
 25


In addition, California has enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which came into effect on January 1, 2020. Pursuant to the CCPA, certain businesses are required, among other things, to make certain enhanced disclosures related to California residents regarding the use or disclosure of their personal information, allow California residents to opt-out of certain uses and disclosures of their personal information without penalty, provide Californians with other choices related to personal data in our possession, and obtain opt-in consent before engaging in certain uses of personal information relating to Californians under the age of 16. The California Attorney General may seek substantial monetary penalties and injunctive relief in the event of our non-compliance with the CCPA. The CCPA also allows for private lawsuits from Californians in the event of certain data breaches. Aspects of the CCPA remain uncertain, and we may be required to make modifications to our policies or practices in order to comply.
 It is possible the data protection laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. If so, this could result in government-imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our practices, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, these privacy regulations may differ from country to country and state to state, and may vary based on whether testing is performed in the United States or in the local country. Complying with these various laws and regulations could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business. Further, compliance with data protection laws and regulations could require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to collect, use and disclose data, or in some cases, impact our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions. We can provide no assurance that we are or will remain in compliance with diverse privacy and security requirements in all of the jurisdictions in which we do business. If we fail to comply or are deemed to have failed to comply with applicable privacy protection laws and regulations such failure could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us, which could include substantial civil and/or criminal penalties, as well as private litigation and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our operating results and business.
 U.S. Healthcare Reform
 In the U.S. and some non-U.S. jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could, among other things, affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.
 Among policy makers and payors in the U.S. and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, or PPACA, and the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 substantially changed the way healthcare is delivered and financed by both governmental and private insurers. These changes included the creation of demonstration programs and other value-based purchasing initiatives that provide financial incentives for physicians and hospitals to reduce costs, including incentives for furnishing low cost therapies. Under the Trump Administration, there were ongoing efforts to modify or repeal all or part of PPACA or take executive action that affects its implementation. Tax reform legislation was passed that includes provisions that impact healthcare insurance coverage and payment such as the elimination of the tax penalty for individuals who do not maintain health insurance coverage (the so-called “individual mandate”). Such actions or similar actions could have a negative effect on the utilization of our products. We are uncertain as to the extent such efforts will continue under the Biden administration and to what extent there will be additional reform proposals at federal and state levels. On December 18, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld a lower court’s determination in Texas v. Azar, 4:18-cv-00167, that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case to the lower court for further analysis as to whether PPACA as a whole is unconstitutional because the individual mandate is not severable from other provisions of the law. In November 2020, the United States Supreme Court held oral arguments on the Fifth Circuit United States Court of Appeals decision that held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional. It is uncertain how the United States Supreme Court will rule on this case or how healthcare measures of the Biden administration will impact the PPACA and our business. Litigation and legislation over the PPACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results. We cannot predict the ultimate results of the Texas case or whether additional legislative reform proposals will be adopted, when they will be adopted, or what impact they may have on us, but any such proposals could have a negative impact on our business and provide incentives for hospitals and physicians to not use our products. 
 26


General legislative action may also affect our business. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 included provisions to reduce the federal deficit. The Budget Control Act, as amended, resulted in the imposition of reductions of up to 2% in Medicare payments to providers which began in April 2013, which, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension implemented under various COVID-19 relief legislation from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, unless additional congressional action is taken. These or other similar reductions in government healthcare spending could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.
 Further, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal legislation designed to bring transparency to product pricing and reduce the cost of products and services under government healthcare programs. Additionally, individual states in the U.S. have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures. Moreover, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what products to purchase and which suppliers will be included in their healthcare programs.
 Employees and Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 85 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.
 Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
 Backlog
 We have no material backlog of orders.
 Financial Information about Segments
 We manage our operations as two reportable segments for the purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions. See “Note 16 – Segment Information” in the notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
