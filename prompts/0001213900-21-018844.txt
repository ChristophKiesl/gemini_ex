ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Mission



Our mission is to re-humanize healthcare by enabling doctors to be doctors. Our solution helps relieve the burden of medical note documentation so that doctors can focus on what they do best — patient care.
Overview



The medical note documentation burden in the U.S. is significant. It is a major contributor to doctor burnout, which according to a recent study in the Annals of Internal Medicine, costs the U.S. healthcare industry $4.6 billion from lost productivity and recruiting costs.



Healthcare practitioners in the U.S. often look to outsourced solutions to handle their documentation. There are various solutions that are marketed to clinicians (which include licensed physicians, nurse practitioners and physicians’ assistants, but not registered nurses). These range in scope from self-serve dictation tools to fully out-sourced medical note documentation solutions. We are a provider of a fully out-sourced medical note documentation solution that also provides supplemental clinical support to the U.S. healthcare industry.



Augmedix, Inc. was incorporated in 2013 and launched its commercial real-time, remote documentation services in 2014. We provide software compatible with off-the-shelf, mobile client devices (smartphones or Google Glass) that enables clinicians to communicate with remotely-located documentation specialists (each an “RDS”, and collectively “RDSs”). Our RDSs observe the clinician-patient interaction, through an audio/video stream, and extract the relevant elements of that interaction to create the medical notes that are then uploaded into the patient’s chart contained within the electronic health record (“EHR”) system. The EHR system is third-party software licensed by the healthcare clinic or system to manage patient charts.



Patient care in the U.S. is provided in ambulatory or clinical environments and hospitals. We focus most of our efforts in the ambulatory/clinical segment of the patient care market. Roughly 85% of the physicians who subscribe to our service are employed directly by, or are affiliated with, a healthcare enterprise. The remaining 15% consists of small practices and individual practitioners.



We have generated in excess of four million medical notes since we began offering our service and are currently delivering about 35,000 notes to our customers each week. We estimate that our solution saves doctors two to three hours each day which is time that they can redeploy to see more patients or improve their work-life balance. We believe the benefits to healthcare enterprises are increased productivity and higher clinician and patient satisfaction.



The current COVID-19 pandemic and resulting safety protocols have prompted a significant shift towards delivering health services remotely via telemedicine. Our technology platform was designed to enable real time, two-way communication between remotely-located participants. We believe telemedicine will remain an important part of health services delivery even after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.



The COVID-19 pandemic has also required modifications to how we deliver our service. While our general business model is to provide RDS service from central operating centers, local shelter in place orders have required us to shift to work-from-home for all employees and contracted employees. We were able to transition to full work from home for all RDSs worldwide within a few days with very little service interruption. We will continue our work from home model until and to the extent that local conditions allow for employees to safely work from our operations centers. We instituted additional system controls to ensure compliance with our privacy practices.

Our technology vision is to automate as much of the medical note creation process as possible by applying an approach referred to as “intelligent automation.” While the unstructured nature of a conversation between physician and patient places inherent limitations on how much note creation can ultimately be automated, we believe automation, even if partial, generates significant benefits including improved operating efficiencies, higher-quality medical notes and a more uniform level of note quality.



Our intelligent automation approach toward achieving note automation is different than that being pursued by other participants in our industry. Our approach is based upon our belief that technicians will be a necessary part of the note creation process for a long time. We use widely available technology today to mine our data sets and help us build the proprietary models needed to enable automation. However, we use such technology to build tools that our RDSs can use to automate some of the principal tasks in the note creation process rather than requiring significant changes or structure to the clinician’s workflow.



Our Industry



Accurate medical records are indispensable to ongoing patient care. The cornerstone of any medical record system is proper recording of a patient’s examination as it occurs. Pen and paper, either in the hands of a physician or an in-person documentation specialist, was the traditional method of producing medical notes, but this method can be both time consuming in the hands of a caregiver and subject to subsequent misinterpretation due to illegibility or other factors. Misinterpretation of the information actually recorded can lead to confusion regarding the patient’s condition and/or clinician services provided. The volume of medical information required to be recorded and the number of intended recipients has also increased.



The advent of computerized record systems, that are now an integral part of the healthcare landscape as a result of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”), has ushered in a new era of record keeping in which medical records are stored as electronic text and data that enhances legibility and has the potential to be more thorough. Furthermore, computerized record systems can be instantly accessed by numerous practitioners at the same time, which has enabled medical practitioners to instantly share medical records with each other for mutually-served patients.



The enormous resources expended on medical documentation has burdened the healthcare industry and caused many organizations, as well as individual practitioners, to look to outsourcing solutions. Existing EHR medical record systems are generally cumbersome for practitioners to use due to their highly structured nature and user interfaces that cause data entry to be regimented by design and be quite time consuming. Today, we estimate that up to one-third of a doctor’s day is consumed by the required and complex interactions with the EHR. This can lead to many physicians authoring their notes hours or days after the actual patient visit. Physicians also need to invest significant time to familiarize themselves with the EHR whenever a new EHR is adopted or whenever an update to an existing EHR is introduced. These issues are compounded by the fractured nature of the EHR space, with over 700 different EHRs available in the U.S. The largest of these are Epic, Cerner, Allscripts and Athena.



The principal legacy tools and solutions (manual, or existing EHR solutions) are not ideally suited to the changing U.S. healthcare landscape. Automated dictation tools have evolved such that they convert speech to text with minimal errors, however, they demand a great deal of the clinician’s time to convert the relevant aspects of their interactions with patients into a cogent, accurate and comprehensive medical note. The in-person documentation specialist, one of the most prevalent out-sourced solutions, has been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic which reduced the ability for such personnel to be physically present at the point of care delivery.



Our Opportunity



We believe that we have the opportunity to serve the ambulatory/clinical segment of the U.S. patient care services market with solutions that address medical note documentation needs. Our solutions cater to large and small healthcare organizations but can also be adopted by individual practitioners. There are currently about 1.1 million physicians in the U.S. About 88% of these, or 980,000 work within the specialties that we currently cover. Of these, about 30%, or 295,000, fall within the productivity parameters we establish as the best prospects for realizing the highest customer ROIs. Using an average current subscription price of $1,800/doctor/month, we believe that our total addressable market in the U.S. is approximately $6.0 billion annually.





2







Our existing customers employ directly, or are affiliated with, about 210,000 physicians. We estimate there are about 50,000 addressable physicians within this group, which translates to a $1.0 billion opportunity annually. As such, our existing enterprise healthcare customers represent about 17% of the total U.S. addressable market. Based upon the number of physicians we currently service, we have penetrated about one percent of the potential that resides within our existing enterprise customer base.



In addition to physicians who work in the ambulatory or clinical setting of healthcare centers, there are approximately 57,000 emergency department physicians in the U.S. today which would increase the size of our total addressable market. We had a successful pilot of our service at one hospital in California. In early 2021, we initiated a marketing campaign to promote the service.



The Benefits of our Services



The core value of our service is relieving the medical note documentation burden placed on clinicians. According to Physician Compensation Report and National Physician Report, it is estimated that clinicians spend one-third of their day on non-revenue generating documentation activity as of 2019. We leverage technology and services to address the core documentation challenges of clinicians. Our solution saves this time while improving clinical documentation and quality measures for reimbursement. We believe our solution leads to higher patient satisfaction, as clinicians can focus their entire attention on their patients instead of having to disrupt the natural flow of discourse in order to write, type or dictate the medical note themselves during the visit.



For most of our Live (as defined below) customers, we also provide other services such as care reminders, orders and referrals, which enhance our value proposition. Care reminders are text notifications we provide physicians during their interactions with patient visit that point out areas that should be addressed by the physician with the patient. Our RDSs source the information for such reminders from the patient’s EHR, which physicians sometimes do not have time to review thoroughly prior to the patient visit. Examples of reminders include notifications of medication contraventions, vaccinations or preventive screening tests due.



Our value proposition is anchored on the time savings we generate for our users. We can save certain clinicians up to two to three hours per day in paperwork administration, depending on their patient volume. Our documentation solution increases productivity by up to 20% as well as increase certain clinicians satisfaction with work-life balance by 49%, according to internal management studies and customer satisfaction surveys. We have created a data driven sales approach with health systems to evaluate productivity and charting efficiency of all eligible providers. Understanding each individual clinician’s efficiency enables us to clearly identify their potential ROI and provide the health system with a credible estimate of the expected ROI at the enterprise level.



Our service has demonstrated its effect on improving the top line of our enterprise customers. Based upon actual results of a study we conducted of 136 physicians from one of our enterprise customers, our service can be expected to generate an estimated $3.13 million of net revenue over a 12-month period for every cohort of 100 doctors, made up of 67 primary care physicians and 33 specialty doctors. For these purposes, we define net revenue as the gross improvement in revenue less the fees paid to Augmedix. We believe the economic benefit of a high ROI, coupled with increased clinician’s satisfaction and the inherent tight integration into the clinician’s workflow, are the primary drivers behind our high net revenue retention rate, which stood at 114% as of December 31, 2020.



What Sets Us Apart



Since we developed our concept of remote, real time medical note documentation, several companies have entered the field. To varying degrees, each offers a solution that addresses the documentation burden faced by physicians. We believe that our service is distinct from these other providers because our solution addresses every aspect of the documentation burden placed upon clinicians.



At its core, our service is predicated upon four foundational elements, each of which is critical in relieving a clinician’s documentation burden. We believe we are the only service among our peers to offer all four.









3







We leverage the ambient conversation between physician and patient as the input source for the medical notes we produce. This results in the greatest time savings for physicians, as they do not have to expend time on extraneous functions to transmit the information to the RDS. It also results in higher patient satisfaction since physicians are not required to alter their natural interaction with patients.



Furnishing doctors with mobile devices, through which they access our service, provides them with freedom of movement, which is essential as they see patients in several exam rooms and as they communicate with their RDS while they travel between exam rooms and their office. And as physicians have had to embrace telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic, having a mobile device enables them to connect to the service from the safety of their home.



Our RDSs are remotely-located. As a result, our services are less intrusive than an in-person documentation specialist and allow for a more comfortable environment for patients. The remote nature of our services also allows us to recruit from a large and geographically diverse pool of candidates. The vast majority of our RDSs are currently located in South Asia. Importantly, we have not been impacted by the restrictions placed on in-person documentation specialists by many healthcare organizations.



Finally, our premium Live (as defined below) service is real time. Real time offers significant benefits to physicians as it allows them the peace of mind that their documentation is completed when they are done with a patient visit, thus eliminating the need to recall what occurred during the typical 15-30 patient visits they service each day. More importantly, it allows for real time interactivity between the physician and RDS. This is critical in addressing any ambiguities in the information observed by the RDS and results in a higher quality medical note. Further, it enables us to deliver valuable clinical support services that our customers are increasingly demanding, such as care reminders, order processing and referrals. Delivery of such additional services increases our utility to our customers.



Our Services and Business Model



We provide two primary subscription services, each of which feature best-in-class medical note documentation. Our RDSs are trained experts who use our proprietary software to deliver timely and clinically accurate medical notes.

● | Augmedix Live. In our real time service, branded “Live”, dedicated trained RDSs provide medical documentation and live clinical support. We provide clinicians special purpose mobile devices to connect to their assigned RDS and stream the audio and video of patient visits. Clinicians may choose to use a smartphone or a Google Glass unit as their preferred mobile device to connect with their assigned RDS. The client devices are owned by us and are an integral part of the service offering. Our RDS is a member of the care team and engages in two-way communication with the clinician during the shift. The RDS creates and enters the medical note into the patient’s EHR chart for final review by the clinician. RDSs also prepare pending orders and referral letters and provide reminders regarding clinical matters throughout the shift. This service is offered as an annual subscription with various tiers based upon committed monthly RDS hourly support. If the clinician’s service needs change, tiers may be adjusted periodically to provide a better reflection of actual service usage.

● | Augmedix Notes. We launched our non-real time offering, branded “Notes,” in 2020. In our Notes offering, RDSs provide medical documentation based upon recorded visits. We furnish clinicians a smartphone to record the audio and video for patient visits during a shift. Google Glass is not currently offered as a client device for the Notes service. The RDS creates and enters the medical note into the patient’s EHR chart for final review by the clinician. Notes are delivered no later than the next business day and generally prior to the beginning of the clinician’s next shift. This service is offered on a monthly subscription basis with pricing based upon the monthly number of notes produced or recording hours. We believe this offers physicians more flexibility than a scheduled service where they must commit to a fixed number of hours, regardless of how much they use the service. With Notes, our customers only pay for the medical notes requested or hours recorded.

Our Competition



We compete on the basis of price, quality of service offered, breadth of services and uniqueness of service. We believe our competitors fall into three broad categories.

● | Dictation software providers. Uncustomized dictation software provides a Do-It-Yourself tool for those clinicians who prefer to create their own medical notes but do not need their notes in real time. It is the lowest cost solution but also provides the least utility to the clinician and is at most risk of error. Several of our enterprise customers also provide their clinicians with dictation tools. Examples include Dragon, an offering of Nuance Communications, Inc. and Fluency from M-Modal, a subsidiary of 3M Corporation.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Third-party, non-real time medical note generators. Non-real time solutions are more costly than dictation software but provide more value to clinicians because they more accurately capture and reflect the ambient conversation between clinician and patient which they use as their primary input source. Through our Notes service, we are a participant in the non-real time segment of the market. Our Notes service differentiates itself from other market participants primarily on the basis of price and note quality. Other market participants include IKS Healthcare, Robin Healthcare, Nuance DAX and DeepScribe.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Real time medical note documentation services. These solutions deliver the most value to physicians given their timeliness and synchronous nature. Clinicians can expect to see considerable time savings by minimizing any downstream editing as any ambiguities are dealt with at the time they arise. The largest participant in this sector, Scribe America, provides this service in-person. In-person solutions have drawbacks, however, including personnel restrictions within many healthcare facilities today due to the COVID-19 pandemic safety protocols or other factors. Another major challenge is the available supply of qualified candidates to fill the role of documentation specialist, which is limited to the geographic location of the clinician. Additionally, some patients are uncomfortable in the presence of an unfamiliar non-clinician in the exam room. Our real time solution - Live – differentiates itself from current providers by leveraging remotely-located specialists. M-Modal is another participant in this segment.

Our Growth Strategy



There are over 1.1 million physicians in the U.S., of which 69% work for, or are affiliated with, a health system. Our current customer accounts, together, employ directly, or have affiliations with, a total of approximately 210,000 physicians, of which we currently serve less than 1%. Our growth strategy is focused on five areas:

● | Expand our relationship with current large physician group and health systems customers. Historically, our growth has been fueled by reducing physician burnout for high producing physicians. This approach has led to slow and steady growth since our inception. Our data-driven approach to expand existing accounts identifies physicians whose productivity is below targeted levels as a result of their documentation burden. We believe proactively identifying these physicians and demonstrating the value of our service will grow our existing client base.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sell new products in our existing and new health systems. The 2020 launch of Notes will help us expand our relationship with existing customers as Notes unlocks new segments of clinicians not fully addressed by our Live service. We also recently launched our Emergency Department offering that expands our total addressable market and provides a new entry point into new health systems. We will continue to expand our offerings where we have data and assets that provide us a competitive advantage. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sell our products to new health systems and large physician groups. Our sales team consistently seeks to identify health systems and large physician groups that we believe will benefit from our service. We believe that the attributes of potential customers most suited to our solution include physicians that struggle with documentation efficiency, customers that seek to transition to value based care, and customers that are in geographic locations where the workforce is not suited to assist physicians with documentation due to cost or lack of skills.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Target sales to small practices and independent physicians. A portion of our potential customers include individual physicians that are not affiliated with health systems or large physician groups. We aim to contract with these parties directly for our services using a transactional sales model.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Leverage channel partnerships to drive sales. We believe our position in the exam room may be attractive to potential partners with adjacent offerings. Examples could include data analytics companies working to provide physicians with clinical insights, EHR companies that are trying to reduce the documentation burden their software creates, pharmaceutical companies that seek physician participation in clinical trials, and medical supply companies that work with physicians to buy their product.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Technology Platform



Our Technology Strategy 



Our technology strategy is focused on providing tools to RDSs to render our medical note documentation service efficiently. The technology that we provide to clinicians is familiar and simple to operate. Clinicians are provided a single purpose mobile device with a simple-to-use application for ease of onboarding. Each component of our technology platform – from the streaming data channel, to its visual and audio presentation within the RDS cockpit, to the software used by the RDS’ to create the note – are designed to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996’s (“HIPAA”) standards pertaining to data security.



Our platform is remote and mobile thus, is suited to support both in person and telemedicine visits. The devices that we provide to clinicians can be used to capture telemedicine visits regardless of the telehealth platform used by the clinician. We render a seamless service experience as the clinician moves from telephone calls, to video calls, to in person visits. Our devices follow the clinician ensuring that the connection between clinician and RDS remains intact during the clinician’s entire shift. Additionally, we have developed some integration of our platform with certain telehealth platforms to further facilitate the experience for both our RDSs and our customers.



Augmedix Platform Overview



Our technology platform consists of three primary components.




● | Clinician Device. The clinician’s interface device, either a Smartphone (“Phone”) or Google Glass device (“Glass”) is used during patient encounters to enable remote audio/video feed of the visit. Our proprietary single purpose app (“Doc App”) that runs on the Phone and/or Glass facilitates secure communication between the clinician and RDS.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | RDS Cockpit. The stream of audio and video from the clinician’s Doc App is transmitted to a web application (“RDS Cockpit”) for the RDS to communicate with the clinician and prepare the medical note. RDS managers pair RDSs to clinicians based on medical specialty and health system EHR credentials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Streaming Service. The clinician device and the RDS Cockpit are linked by a common layer of servers that establish secure connections and signal handling for streaming audio/visual feeds and other data interactions between the Doc App and RDS Cockpit. The visit is live streamed for the Live service and recorded for RDS playback in the Notes service.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clinician Devices and Doc App 



We provide multiple third-party device options for clinicians, each of which is configured with a proprietary Doc App. We offer a standalone Smartphone Doc App that runs on a Smartphone with an Android operating system. The Doc App provides real time streaming and instant messaging so that the RDS can communicate in real time with the clinician. We also offer a standalone Android Doc App that runs on Google Glass which also provides real time streaming and instant messaging functionality. Our system also features a third Doc App for Notes service. All versions of our Doc App contain features for connecting, communicating, and streaming audio and video to the server. All Android devices in production are locked-down to ensure the security and integrity of the device.



RDS Cockpit



The RDS Cockpit is a web application that RDSs use for their day-to-day activities. The RDS views the audio/video stream from the clinician’s device and uses Notebuilder, third party speech to text and other software tools within this application to capture and document the patient visit. The RDS can direct-message or ask, via a secure audio channel, clarifying questions to the clinician during the shift. All stored data is encrypted with AES-256 bit encryption at rest and in transit. Storage is necessary for note preparation, note completion and quality assurance.

“Intelligent Automation” through Notebuilder 



We use Intelligent Automation, a combination of software and human intervention, to facilitate and automate the medical note creation process. Our Notebuilder application is a patent pending proprietary software tool that leverages structured data to facilitate medical note creation by the RDS. According to our internal studies, the Notebuilder tool allows the RDS to complete the medical note up to 50% faster than manual documentation using free text. We continue to improve the Notebuilder and other documentation tools with the intent of transforming the RDSs role from content creator to content editor.



The Notebuilder displays options which the RDS selects to document relevant patient medical information. The menu of options is curated based upon the patient demographic, medical specialty, visit type and nature of complaint(s). The RDS makes selections related to the conditions reported, timing, frequency and context, of symptoms as well as current medications and treatments, if applicable. The RDS uses Notebuilder to make selections that populate three core sections of the Medical Note: (i) History of Present Illness, (ii) Physical Exam and (iii) Assessment and Plan. Selection options are dynamically filtered as the RDS makes entries such that most relevant selections for medications, tests, imaging, procedures, diagnoses and treatments are displayed. As options are selected by the RDS, Notebuilder automatically generates medically correct natural language sentences summarizing the medical visit into a properly organized medical note for insertion in the patient’s EHR chart.



Notebuilder allows customizations based upon specialty, clinic or individual clinician preferences. Specific clinician preference templates can be saved within the tool and used by the RDS as needed. The Notebuilder provides the RDS with access to medical data sets such as a medication database with dosages, frequency and related side effects.



Notebuilder was initially released in early 2020 and rolled out to all RDSs by December 31, 2020. Product development efforts are ongoing to enhance the features of Notebuilder by increasing the level of automation and adding more specialties and medical data sets.



Speech-to-Text



When a clinician wants exact words entered, generally as a part of the Assessment and Plan section of the medical note, dictation is commonly utilized. We partner with companies providing HIPAA compliant speech-to-text solutions. These are integrated into the RDS Cockpit to facilitate the RDS’ ability to efficiently edit and insert dictations into the medical note. This feature uses a machine learning tool to automatically transcribe speech to text. According to an internal study, dictated words represent an average of 5-10% of a typical medical note. Leveraging a speech-to-text transcription tool improves both the accuracy and time to complete these portions of the note.



Our solution is hosted within our Amazon Web Services Virtual Private Cloud (“VPC”) and leverages one or more HIPAA-compliant third-party services, which transcribes the audio and returns text. All calls to the third-party services do not store any of our data.

Platform Architecture



We use state of the art, HIPAA-compliant cloud infrastructure to host all of our production applications, web services, data-channels, audio-video streaming platforms, databases, and data processing servers for Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning (“AI/ML”). We use a WebRTC platform that employs powerful Android and JavaScript webRTC SDKs to deliver highly secure audio and video to our customers.
Audio Visual Streaming Service



Our platform is hosted inside HIPAA-compliant third-party cloud infrastructure. Communication to and from our platform is encrypted end-to-end and aligned with HIPAA regulations. Each streaming server is load balanced and has redundant capacity to ensure 100% fault tolerance. We provide periodic updates to the platform. Each streaming server is a secured EC2 instance, hosting dockerized containers for streaming servers (Janus MCU, TURN), proxy and load balancer. If applicable, clinician-patient conversation audio files are stored in HIPAA- compliant disk/block storage attached to the EC2 instances and at the end of day uploaded to Amazon Web Services S3 blob storage.
Security



DTLS-SRTP is used to ensure end-to-end security. Audio-video data is encrypted with AES 128 bit encryption. AES 128 key exchange happens over ECDHE_ECDSA with P-256 curve during DTLS handshake. Signaling happens over HTTPS/TLS 1.2 channel using RSA 2048 bit encryption.
Data Channel



A dedicated data channel is required to cover critical communication between the RDSs and clinicians. The channel is such that the conversation between the clinician and the RDS happens in a “room.” Each of the rooms work like a typical chat room with each shift comprising a session. The conversations usually include typical routine IMs, signals, switches to activate, deactivate or change state of certain components running in our Doc App and RDS Portal. The RDS Portal and Doc App both interact with the data channel over a secure network. The data channel consists of multiple nodes behind a Network Load Balancer (“NLB”) to ensure horizontal scalability and fault tolerance. Each of the nodes provides a full-duplex secure WebSocket connection to maintain a persistent connection with clients and uses Redis pub/sub mechanism to load balance users among different nodes.



Password protected Amazon Web Services ElastiCache is used as a Redis server that provides HIPAA compliant in-transit and data-at-rest encryption. There are also redundant Redis nodes to ensure fault tolerance.



Data



All web applications and our Doc App web services store data inside HIPAA-compliant MySQL databases. The databases store administrative information relating to clinicians and RDSs. We temporarily store audio and text data on the HIPAA compliant servers to accommodate operational processes including training, quality assurance and production work. We store certain data for longer terms and maintain a database of de-identified data to train our AI models. We also maintain a database of meta-data based on Notebuilder selections. Such data is used to improve our products and provide enhanced services to our customers.
Scalability and Uptime



Our streaming servers with redundant capacity are placed in different availability zones to ensure fault tolerance. All the servers are located in the U.S. All requests to streaming endpoints are load balanced and served in a round-robin approach. Using the proprietary Augmedix OTA portal, we can selectively push Android OS updates to specific devices. We use enterprise level device management software to maintain and manage its Phone devices. New features, improvements, bug fixes made to our RDS Cockpit applications, can be released separately/independently to production servers through a planned and well documented process.

Our Operations



Our Remote Documentations Specialists (“RDS”)



Our services are rendered by highly trained RDSs, who use our technology tools to deliver clinically accurate and comprehensive notes into the customer’s EHR system. Our RDSs observe clinician-patient interactions through audio and video feeds, extract the relevant details of the visit, and document the medical note for clinician review and approval. The medical note contains information vital to on-going patient care and billing and is securely stored in the patient’s unique chart in the EHR. RDSs use dedicated, secure terminals to access the RDS Cockpit which includes the Notebuilder and other tools to view the visit and create the medical note. The task of observing a doctor-patient interaction, extracting the relevant aspects of the conversation and then recording them in a structured medical note is difficult and requires a significant amount of skill and training.



Our RDSs are well educated, most at the university level and many are recruited straight out of university. Many have Biology majors, but we also recruit from various other disciplines. We also recruit from a large, established pool of medical transcriptionists in India. The RDS position can be a very attractive alternative to medical transcription as that industry is contracting due to advancements in speech-to-text technology. The work performed by our RDSs is dynamic and substantially more complex than transcription as it requires considerable cognitive ability and understanding of nuanced physician-patient interactions and synthesizing into cogent and accurate medical notes, while transcription is a verbatim rendition of recorded audio.



All of our RDSs must pass our mandatory intensive training program prior to working with our clinicians. Our proprietary training modules are trainer-led and include medical visit basics, visit videos, medical documentation standards and requirements, and practice sessions using Notebuilder and other tools. The training program for new RDSs takes approximately three months for international trainees to complete and includes strict testing and grade achievement standards. We also provide specialty training for several specialties. We support many specialties in clinic and in hospital settings and are continuing to build our specialty training library.



Our Live service is provided during the clinician’s shift. Our RDSs serve as an extension of the care team and are assigned to clinicians based on specialty. Typically, one RDS will accompany a clinician for the duration of that clinician’s shift, though on occasion a clinician may have multiple RDSs accompanying her or him on a shift. Currently, our RDSs require more time than his/her assigned clinician to complete a shift’s worth of medical notes due to pre-charting and note finishing.



Our Notes service takes place after the patient visit. Clinician-patient interactions are recorded for playback by our RDS. Completed notes based on that recording are delivered before the clinician resumes his/her next shift. The task of creating a medical note from a recording is less challenging than doing so in real time. Moreover, and in particular with the benefit of our Notebuilder, an RDS is able to handle the notes for more than one clinician during his/her shift.



Our Operation Centers



We provide service from nine RDS Operations Centers across four countries – the US, Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka. There are six centers in India and one center in Sri Lanka that are owned and operated by five independent third parties (the “Vendors”), while the two centers in the US and Bangladesh are wholly-owned and operated by us. Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, most of our worldwide RDSs are currently working from home in compliance with local regulations and safety protocols.



Our strategy is to diversify geographical risk by operating out of several operating centers located in various cities throughout Asia, with a smaller operation within the US. The US operation accounts for a small fraction of our global RDS workforce and we expect it to remain below 10% of the global total for the foreseeable future. Our Bangladesh operation is our fastest growing center. It served about 29% of our customers at December 31, 2020. Our goal is to reach up to 35% by late-2021. This is to enable greater control over a larger percentage of our operations and to mitigate concentration risk among existing Vendors.



All Vendors are currently paid based upon an hourly rate and the number of assigned contracted clinician hours. This payment arrangement represents a substantial change from the previous model that operated through the first half of 2020 wherein Vendors included additional flat fees for each RDS passing our training and certification requirements. Under the current arrangement, effective for all Vendors by July 2020, the hourly rate paid to each Vendor incorporates the amortized cost of training and certifications.

Our Bangladeshi RDSs, all of whom are employees, are paid a fixed monthly salary. In addition to RDSs, our Bangladesh offices include engineering, customer support, human resources, global information technology, compliance, finance and accounting and general management, among other personnel. All our Bangladesh-based employees receive complimentary benefits such as healthcare, and when working from our offices, meals, private transportation to their homes after their shifts, among others. We believe the compensation we provide our Bangladeshi employees is competitive in the local market for US-based employers.



Our Customers



Our customers are diverse in size, geography, and specialty. Our clients include some of the largest health systems and specialty groups in the U.S., including Sutter Health, Dignity Health, US Oncology, TriHealth, Northern Light, Summit Pacific and UCSF, among others. Approximately 85% of the physicians we serve are members of health systems, while the remaining 15% are from small independent practices. We have a relatively high concentration of physicians served among our enterprise customers, with one client accounting for 27% while the remaining physicians served are spread across 14 other health systems. We generated revenue from customers in 34 different states in 2020, the largest concentration being in California. Within our customer base, we currently serve 37 specialties, the largest of which is family practice at 49% of total physicians served. Our systems are compatible with 19 different EHRs. The top four account for 78% of all our physicians served, with Epic at 40%, Cerner at 29%, iKnowMed at 6%, and Allscripts at 3%.



Areas of expansion within our existing enterprise customers include deeper penetration of the locations in which we already serve physicians, coverage of new specialties, and entering new care locations. We define success with our clients with respect to two key criteria, increased productivity and physician satisfaction. With clients that follow our best practices framework and share data with us, we focus on time savings and productivity increases, the latter measured in work Relative Value Units (“wRVU”), per individual physician. wRVUs reflect the time, technical skill and effort, mental effort and judgment, and stress to provide a given medical service. The number of wRVUs a provider generates ties directly to reimbursement rates in most payment models. Relative Value Units generally rank the resources (including physician’s work, expenses of the physician’s practice, and professional liability insurance) used to provide a particular medical service based upon that service’s Current Procedural Terminology (“CPT”) code or Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (“HCPCS”) code. To determine the level of reimbursement from a payor (typically an insurance company such as Blue Cross or Aetna) for a given service, a service’s RVUs are multiplied by a dollar conversion factor. Conversion factors and fee schedules are established by the Medical Group Management Association (“MGMA”) and CSA Group, independent testing and standards bodies serving the US healthcare industry.



The primary drivers of the physician work portion of RVU, or wRVU, are patient volume, the appropriate and completeness of the documentation describing the services rendered during the patient visit and the efficiency with which such services were performed. The aggregate increase in wRVU production across their physician base drives the health system’s overall financial performance and the ROI potential of our service for our customers.



Some examples of the value our users see is captured in the following case studies:



Case Study #1: Dr. Seneca Dewar, Dignity Health



Highlights: 




● | Charting Hours: 20 hours saved charting per week
--+-------------------------------------------------

Before Augmedix:



Looking to devote more time to patient care



Dr. Seneca Dewar is a primary care physician who was overwhelmed with mandated EHR documentation and spent most of his weekends on data entry. He was typically spending over 20 hours per week completing his patient notes and was increasingly burdened by the documentation.
After Augmedix:



Lower workload and more time with patients



Since Dr. Dewar started working with Augmedix, he finishes his patient notes by the end of every day and dedicates an additional four hours to his clinic time each week. He no longer works after hours and is able to spend his reclaimed time with his family. Overall, he has enjoyed his experience on the Augmedix platform and values working with his tech-enabled documentation team.

Case Study #2: Heather Dountas PA, C



Highlights: 




● | Charting Hours: +16 hours saved charting per week
--+--------------------------------------------------


● | Patient Visits: + 2.6 patient visits per day
--+---------------------------------------------

Before Augmedix:



Overtaxed, under-documented



There were never enough hours in the day for Heather, a busy PA-C in Primary Care. In the midst of a full patient schedule, she was often forced to choose between completing thorough documentation, sending orders, and reconciling medication lists. Heather found herself regularly taking home 2-3 hours of incomplete paperwork per day.
After Augmedix:



Productivity increased, balance restored



Since starting with Augmedix, Heather is doing what she once thought impossible: seeing more patients, spending less time on documentation, and providing higher quality care, all while being fully present with her patients. She leaves work on time with the day’s notes completed, ready to enjoy her reclaimed time with her family.
Governmental Regulation



The healthcare industry in which we operate is highly regulated, and the services we provide are subject to a complex set of healthcare laws and regulations. We and our customers must comply with a variety of requirements, including among others, HIPAA, HITECH, regulations issued by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a number of fraud and abuse laws, such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, and comparable state laws. We have structured our operations to comply with these laws and other regulatory and contractual requirements.



HIPAA and HITECH Act



HIPAA establishes a set of national privacy and security standards for protecting the privacy, confidentiality and security of protected health information (“PHI”). Under HIPAA, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers, together referred to as “covered entities” for purposes of HIPAA, and their “business associates” must meet certain standards in order to protect individually identifiable health information. HITECH enhances and strengthens the HIPAA privacy and security standards and makes certain provisions of HIPAA directly applicable to business associates of covered entities.





11







In connection with our business operations, we access, use and disclose PHI on behalf of our covered entity clients, and therefore, are considered to be, a business associate of our customers and subject to HIPAA, and its implementing regulations. As a business associate, we are required to have agreements with our covered entity clients whereby we agree to appropriately safeguard the PHI we create or receive on their behalf and to abide by statutory and other regulatory obligations under HIPAA. These obligations include, but are not limited to, the responsibility to (i) maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of PHI, (ii) report security incidents and other inappropriate uses or disclosures of PHI, including to individuals and governmental authorities, and (iii) assist covered entities from which we obtain health information with certain duties under HIPAA.



HIPAA and HITECH impose numerous requirements on our business operations, and subject us to material liability and other adverse impacts to our business in the event we fail to comply with their requirements. These include, without limitation, civil fines, possible criminal sanctions in certain circumstances, contractual liability to our customers, and damage to our brand and reputation. We have implemented appropriate safeguards to address the privacy and security of PHI consistent with our regulatory and contractual requirements. We also train our personnel regarding HIPAA and other related requirements. We have made and continue to make investments in systems to support customer operations that are regulated by HIPAA and other regulations. Because these standards are subject to interpretation and change, we cannot predict the future impact of HIPAA or other regulations on our business and operations. To comply with our regulatory and contractual obligations, we may have to adjust our policies and practices and invest in new technologies.



Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act



We may also be subject to various federal laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry.



For example, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or paying remuneration (a term interpreted broadly to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts and credits), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, an item or reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Penalties for federal Anti-Kickback Statute violations can be severe, and include imprisonment, criminal fines, civil money penalties with triple damages (when the False Claims Act is implicated) and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations.



In addition, the federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services that are false or fraudulent. Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, we could be held liable under the False Claims Act if we are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, including inaccurate information in draft medical notes for physicians, or if our documentation services are found to have caused clinicians to have inaccurately attested to “Meaningful Use” criteria.



Other Laws and Regulations



In addition to HIPAA and HITECH, numerous other state and federal laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of individually identifiable health information. In many cases, state laws are not preempted by the HIPAA privacy and security standards and may impose more stringent standards, thus complicating compliance efforts. Similarly, state anti-kickback and false claims laws may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only government programs.



We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which prohibits improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and requires companies to maintain accurate books and records and a system of internal accounting controls. Safeguards we implement to discourage improper payments or offers of payments by our employees, consultants, and others may be ineffective, and violations of the FCPA and similar laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, or other liabilities or proceedings against us, any of which would likely harm our reputation, business, financial condition and result of operations.

Sales and Marketing



Currently, we predominantly rely upon a dedicated direct sales force and account management team to sell our solutions. The direct sales force is structured geographically and focuses on acquiring new health systems, large physician specialty practices and generating transactional sales with smaller practices and independent physicians. Our sales force mobilizes data to demonstrate a clear ROI for investing in our solution to potential customers. There is typically a 30-day implementation window from contract execution to first day of service to allow for provision of hardware, clinician workflow orientation, RDS assignment and receipt of EHR credentials.



Additional sales activity is driven by our account management team. The account management team is responsible for expansion within our existing client base. The team is structured by account segment: strategic enterprises, developing enterprises, and independents.



Our marketing efforts focus on lead generation, building market awareness and content support. Marketing drives market/brand awareness and inbound leads from both enterprises and independent physicians. Our team tracks the effectiveness of specific marketing campaigns to ensure their efficacy against our established cost-per-lead and customer acquisition cost targets. A variety of marketing approaches are leveraged including search engine optimization, paid search advertising, social media campaigns, social media advertising, and email marketing. We also focus on end-to-end marketing campaigns to drive leads and awareness, such as our 2020 launch of Notes.



Research & Development



Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (“AI/ML”) 



We are developing the ability to integrate AI/ML into Notebuilder to increase efficiency by automatically providing note suggestions to our RDSs. This requires training AI/ML models comparing de-identified transcripts of patient visits with their corresponding medical notes. We store audio and note records used in this process only if agreed to by the customer. We use automated speech-to-text tools, as edited by transcriptionists, to produce transcripts for the persisted audios of selected doctor/patient visits. We apply a de-identification process to the audio transcripts of the doctor/patient visits to remove protected health information (“PHI”). This is followed by an annotation process to assign labels to both the transcripts and corresponding notes. The labels that come from the annotation step are used to develop classification models. The final stage is to apply one of several Natural Language Generation methods to generate sentences. Our goal is to provide note suggestions which will be integrated into Notebuilder to further reduce the amount of human intervention needed to create a medical note. These models are currently in the development phase.
Streaming Technologies



In addition to continuously improving our streaming platform, we constantly evaluate third-party streaming solutions for low latency, high fidelity. The goal is to improve the reliability and scalability of the Platform while reducing costs.
Devices for Providers



We continue to explore alternate hardware devices that can be used by clinicians. In addition to ease of use, improved audio quality, better connectivity and faster battery charge rate are some of the attributes used in our evaluation process.
Electronic Health Records (“EHRs”)



An EHR is a digital version of a patient’s paper chart. EHRs are real-time, patient-centered records that make information available instantly and securely to authorized users. While an EHR does contain the medical and treatment histories of patients, an EHR system is built to go beyond standard clinical data collected in a provider’s office and can be inclusive of a broader view of a patient’s care. EHRs are a vital part of health IT and can:

● | Contain a patient’s medical history, diagnoses, medications, treatment plans, immunization dates, allergies, radiology images, and laboratory and test results
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Allow access to evidence-based tools that providers can use to make decisions about a patient’s care
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Automate and streamline provider workflow
--+------------------------------------------






13







Health information can be created and managed by authorized providers in a digital format capable of being shared with other providers across more than one healthcare organization. EHRs are built to share information with other healthcare providers and organizations – such as laboratories, specialists, medical imaging facilities, pharmacies, emergency facilities, and school and workplace clinics. EHR systems are selected by our customers either as independent physicians, clinics or health systems.



Currently, we do all of our note transfers manually. We are developing technology to integrate our software tools into the EHR systems used by our large enterprise customers. For our smaller customers we expect to continue to transfer notes to the EHR manually but as we scale within an enterprise health system, EHR integration improves note quality, reduces RDS downtime, and improves RDS scheduling.



Transferring notes to an EHR requires secure access to the customer’s EHR which they must authorize to receive the service. We support various types of virtual private network (“VPN”) access to an EHR, such as site-to-site VPN tunnels, VPN client software, and browser-based VPN plugins like Citrix.



Intellectual Property



Intellectual property is an important aspect of our business, and we seek protection for our intellectual property as appropriate. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, as well as other legal and contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights.



We have been building and continue to build our patent portfolio relating to our technology platform. As of December 31, 2020, our patent portfolio consists of three pending patent applications in the U.S. We regularly review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property.



In addition to patents, we may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect our technology and processes, especially when we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or can be obtained. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, and contractors upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships.



We have filed for and obtained trademark protection in the U.S. for the AUGMEDIX word mark and AUGMEDIX CROSS logo for goods and services. We have also filed for trademark protection in India of the AUGMEDIX word mark for goods and services. We also have registered the domain name for our website, www.augmedix.com.



We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged.



Corporate Information





We were incorporated in the State of Delaware as Malo Holdings Corporation on December 27, 2018. On October 5, 2020, our wholly-owned subsidiary August Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (the “Acquisition Sub”), merged with and into Augmedix, a Delaware corporation (“Private Augmedix”) formed on April 30, 2013 (the “Merger”). Following the Merger, Private Augmedix was the surviving entity and became our wholly-owned subsidiary, and all of the outstanding shares of common and preferred stock of Augmedix were converted into shares of our common stock. The business of Private Augmedix became our business as a result of the Merger. On October 5, 2020, our board of directors and all of our pre-Merger stockholders approved a restated certificate of incorporation, which was effective upon its filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on October 5, 2020 and through which we changed our name to “Augmedix, Inc.”



Our common stock is currently listed and quoted on the over-the-counter market. We announced our listing on the OTC Markets QX Best Market (“OTCQX”) on March 29, 2021.



Our principal executive offices are located at 111 Sutter Street, Suite 1300, San Francisco, CA 94104. Our telephone number is (888) 669-4885. Our website address is www.augmedix.com. Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not a part of this Report.

Employees and Human Capital Resources



As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 97 full-time employees in the U.S., 3 in India and 355 in Bangladesh. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.



Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards.



Facilities



Our corporate headquarters are located in San Francisco, California, where we lease approximately 12,936 square feet of office space under a lease agreement that expires in February 2025. We also lease 23,578 square feet of corporate office space in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and an additional 3,800 square feet of commercial space used for RDS training in an adjacent facility under a lease agreement which automatically renews quarterly unless notice is provided to terminate.



We believe our facilities are suitable to meet our current needs. We intend to expand our facilities or add additional facilities in Dhaka, as we expect to reach the capacity of the existing facilities sometime in 2021. We believe that suitable alternative and/or additional space will be available to accommodate our needs in both San Francisco and Dhaka.



Legal Proceedings



We are not a party to any material pending legal proceedings. From time to time, we may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business.
