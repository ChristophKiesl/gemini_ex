References made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “we”, “our”, “us”, “DMC” and the “Company” refer to DMC Global Inc. (formerly Dynamic Materials Corporation) and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Overview

DMC Global Inc. (formerly "Dynamic Materials Corporation") operates a diversified family of technical product and process businesses serving the energy, industrial and infrastructure markets. Our businesses operate globally through an international network of manufacturing, distribution and sales facilities. 
Our business is organized into two segments: NobelClad and DynaEnergetics. NobelClad is a global leader in the production of explosion-welded clad metal plates for use in the construction of corrosion resistant industrial processing equipment and specialized transition joints. DynaEnergetics designs, manufactures and distributes products utilized by the global oil and gas industry principally for the perforation of oil and gas wells. See Note 6 within Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for net sales, operating income, and total assets for each of our segments. 
Our Strategy
Our business segments each provide a suite of unique technical products to niche segments of the global energy, industrial and infrastructure markets; and each of our businesses has established a strong or leading position in the markets in which it participates. With an underlying focus on free-cash flow generation, our objective is to sustain and grow the market share of our businesses through increased market penetration, development of new applications, and research and development of new and adjacent products that can be sold across our global network of sales and distribution facilities. We also intend to explore potential acquisitions of complementary businesses that could strengthen or add to our existing product portfolio, or expand our geographic footprint and market presence.
Business Segments
NobelClad
Clad metal plates are typically used in the construction of heavy, corrosion resistant pressure vessels and heat exchangers. Clad metal plates consist of a thin layer of an expensive, corrosion resistant cladder metal, such as titanium or nickel alloy, which is metallurgically welded to a less expensive structural backing metal, such as carbon steel.  For heavy equipment, clad plates generally provide an economical alternative to building the equipment solely of a corrosion resistant alloy. While a large portion of the demand for our clad metal products is driven by new plant construction and large plant expansion projects, maintenance and retrofit projects at existing chemical processing, petrochemical processing, oil refining, and aluminum smelting facilities also account for a significant portion of total demand. These industries tend to be cyclical in nature and timing of new order inflow remains difficult to predict. 

There are three major industrial clad plate manufacturing technologies: explosion welding, hot rollbonding and weld overlay. Detaclad®, NobelClad’s process-controlled explosion clad, uses explosion welding, the most versatile of the clad plate manufacturing methods. Created using a robust cold welding technology, explosion-welded clad products exhibit high bond strength and combine the corrosion resistance of the cladder material with the mechanical properties and structural strength of the lower cost of the backer material.  The explosion welding process is suitable for joining virtually any combination of common engineered metals. This represents a competitive advantage versus the hot rollbonding and weld overlay processes, which generally can only clad compatible metals such as nickel alloys and stainless steels.
Explosion-welded clad metal is produced as flat plates or concentric cylinders, which can be further formed and fabricated into a broad range of industrial processing equipment or specialized transition joints. When fabricated properly, the two metals will not come apart, as the bond zone is generally stronger than the parent metals. The dimensional capabilities of the process are broad: cladding metal layers can range from a few thousandths of an inch to several inches in thickness and base metal thickness and lateral dimensions are primarily limited only by the capabilities of the world’s metal production mills.  Explosion welding is used to clad to steel a broad range of metals, including aluminum, titanium, zirconium, nickel alloys and stainless steels.

Clad Metal End Use Markets

Explosion-welded clad metal is primarily used in the construction of large industrial processing equipment that is subject to high pressures and temperatures and/or corrosive processes. Explosion welded clad plates also can be cut into transition joints, which are used to facilitate conventional welding of dissimilar metals. The eight broad industrial sectors discussed below comprise the bulk of demand for NobelClad’s products with oil and gas and chemical and petrochemical constituting approximately two-thirds of NobelClad sales in 2016. This demand is driven by the underlying need for both new equipment and facility maintenance in these primary market sectors. 
Oil and Gas: Oil and gas end use markets include both oil and gas production and petroleum refining. Oil and gas production covers a broad scope of operations related to recovering oil and/or gas for subsequent processing in refineries. Clad metal is used in separators, glycol contractors, pipe lines, heat exchangers and other related equipment. Increased oil and gas production from deep, hot, and more corrosive fields has also increased the demand for clad equipment. Clad is commonly used in these facilities. The primary clad metals for the oil and gas production market are stainless steel and nickel alloys clad to steel, with some use of reactive metals, such as titanium.
Petroleum refining processes frequently are corrosive, hot, and operate at high pressures. Clad metal is extensively used in a broad range of equipment including desulfurization hydrotreaters, coke drums, distillation columns, separators and heat exchangers. The increasing reliance upon low quality, high sulfur crude drives additional demand for new corrosion resistant equipment. Worldwide trends in regulatory control of sulfur emissions in gas, diesel and jet fuel are also increasing the need for clad equipment. Like the upstream oil and gas sector, the clad metals are primarily stainless steel and nickel alloys.
Chemical and Petrochemical: Many common products, ranging from plastics to prescription drugs to electronic materials, are produced by chemical processes. Because the production of these items often involves corrosive agents and is conducted under high pressures or temperatures, corrosion resistant equipment is needed. One of the larger applications for clad equipment is in the manufacture of Purified Terephthalic Acid, a precursor product for polyester, which is used in everything from carpets to plastic bottles. The chemical market requires extensive use of stainless steel and nickel alloys, but also uses titanium, zirconium and tantalum.
Alternative Energy: Some alternative energy technologies involve conditions that necessitate clad metals. Solar panels predominantly incorporate high purity polysilicon. Processes for manufacturing high purity silicon utilize a broad range of highly corrosion-resistant clad alloys. Many geothermal fields are corrosive, requiring high alloy clad separators to handle the hot steam. Some ethanol technologies may require corrosion resistant metals at thicknesses where clad is an attractive alternative.
Hydrometallurgy: The processes for production of nickel, gold, and copper involve acids, high pressures, and high temperatures; and titanium-clad plates are used extensively for construction of associated leaching and peripheral equipment.
Aluminum Production: Aluminum is reduced from its oxide in large electric smelters called potlines. The electric current is carried via aluminum conductors. The electricity must be transmitted into steel components for the high temperature smelting operations. Aluminum cannot be welded to steel conventionally. Explosion-welded aluminum-steel transition joints provide an energy efficient and highly durable solution for making these connections. Modern potlines use a large number of transition joints, which are typically replaced after approximately five years in service. Although aluminum production is the major electrochemical application for NobelClad products, there are a number of other electrochemical applications including production of magnesium, chlorine and chlorate.
Shipbuilding: The combined problems of corrosion and top-side weight drive demand for our aluminum-steel transition joints, which serve as the juncture between a ship's upper and lower structures. Top-side weight is often a significant problem with tall ships, including cruise ships, naval vessels, ferries and yachts. Use of aluminum in the upper structure and steel in the lower structure provides stability. Since aluminum cannot be welded directly to steel using traditional welding processes, and since bolted joints between aluminum and steel corrode quickly in seawater, explosion welded transition joints are a common solution. NobelClad's transition joints have been used in the construction of many well-known ships, including the Queen Elizabeth II and modern U.S. Navy aircraft carriers.
Power Generation: Fossil fuel and nuclear power generation plants require extensive use of heat exchangers, many of which require corrosion resistant alloys to handle low quality cooling water. Our clad plates are used extensively for heat exchanger tubesheets. The largest clad tubesheets are used in the final low-pressure condensers. For most coastal and brackish water-cooled plants, titanium is the metal of choice, and titanium-clad tubesheets are the low-cost solution for power plant condensers.
4

Industrial Refrigeration: Heat exchangers are a core component of refrigeration systems. When the cooling fluid is seawater, brackish, or even slightly polluted, corrosion resistant metals are necessary. Metal selection can range from stainless steel to copper alloy to titanium. Explosion-welded clad metal is often the low cost solution for making the tubesheets. Applications range from refrigeration chillers on fishing boats to massive air conditioning units for skyscrapers, airports, and deep underground mines.
Operations
The NobelClad segment seeks to build on its leadership position in its markets.  During the three years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the NobelClad segment represented approximately 58%, 54% and 48% of our consolidated net sales, respectively.  The three manufacturing plants and their respective shooting sites in Pennsylvania, Germany and France provide the production capacity to address concurrent projects for NobelClad’s international customer base.

The principal product of metal cladding, regardless of the process used, is a metal plate composed of two or more dissimilar metals, usually a corrosion resistant metal (the "cladder") bonded to a steel backing plate. Prior to the explosion-welding process, the materials are inspected, the mating surfaces are ground, and the metal plates are assembled for cladding. The process involves placing a sheet of the cladder over a parallel plate of backer material and then covering the cladder with a layer of specifically formulated explosive powder. A small gap or “standoff space” is maintained between the cladder and backer using small spacers. The explosion is then initiated on one side of the cladder and travels across the surface of the cladder forcing it onto the backer. The explosion happens in approximately one-thousandth of a second.  The collision conditions cause a thin layer of the mating surfaces, as well as the spacers, to be spalled away in a jet.  This action removes oxides and surface contaminants immediately ahead of the collision point.  The extreme pressures force the two metal components together, creating a metallurgical bond between them.  The explosion welding process produces a strong, ductile, continuous metallurgical weld over the clad surface.  After the explosion is completed, the resulting clad plates are flattened and cut, and then undergo testing and inspection to assure conformance with internationally accepted product specifications.
EXPLOSION-WELDING PROCESS

Explosion-welded cladding technology is a method for welding metals that cannot be joined using conventional welding processes, such as titanium-steel, aluminum-steel, and aluminum-copper. Explosion welding also can be used to weld compatible metals, such as stainless steels and nickel alloys to steel.  The cladding metals are typically titanium, stainless steel, aluminum, copper alloys, nickel alloys, tantalum, and zirconium. The base metals are typically carbon steel, alloy steel, 
5

stainless steel and aluminum.  Although the patents for the basic explosion-welded cladding process have expired, NobelClad has developed a proprietary knowledge of process control that distinguishes it from its competitors by yielding rejection rates and costs of quality significantly less than 1%. The entire explosion-welding process involves significant precision in all stages, and any errors can be extremely costly as they often result in the discarding of the expensive raw material metals.  NobelClad’s technological expertise is a significant advantage in preventing costly waste.
NobelClad’s metal products are primarily produced for custom projects and conform to requirements set forth in customers’ purchase orders. Upon receipt of an order, NobelClad obtains the component materials from a variety of sources based on quality, availability and cost and then produces the order in one of its three manufacturing plants.  Final products are processed to meet contract specific requirements for product configuration and quality/inspection level.

Suppliers and Raw Materials

NobelClad's operations involve a range of alloys, steels and other materials, such as stainless steel, copper alloys, nickel alloys, titanium, zirconium, tantalum, aluminum and other metals.  NobelClad sources its raw materials from a number of different producers and suppliers. It holds a limited metal inventory and purchases its raw materials based on contract specifications. Under most contracts, any raw material price increases are passed on to NobelClad’s customers.  NobelClad closely monitors the quality of its supplies and inspects the type, dimensions, markings, and certification of all incoming metals to ensure that the materials will satisfy applicable construction codes. NobelClad also manufactures a majority of its own explosives from standard raw materials, thus achieving higher quality and lower cost.
Competition

Metal Cladding.  NobelClad faces competition from two primary alternative cladding technologies: hot rollbonding and weld overlay. Usually the three processes do not compete directly, as each has its own preferential domain of application relating to metal used and thicknesses required.  However, due to specific project considerations such as technical specifications, price and delivery time, explosion-welding may have the opportunity to compete successfully against these technologies.  Rollbond is only produced by a few steel mills in the world. In this process, the clad metal and base metal are bonded during the hot rolling operation in which the metal slab is converted to plate. Being a high temperature process that yields the formation of detrimental intermetallics, hot rollbond is limited to joining similar metals, such as stainless steel and nickel alloys to steel.  Rollbond’s niche is production of large quantities of light to medium gauge clad plates.  Rollbond products are generally suitable for most pressure vessel applications but have lower bond shear strength and may have inferior corrosion resistance. 
The weld overlay process, which is used by the many vessel fabricators that are often also NobelClad customers, is a slow and labor-intensive process that requires a large amount of floor space for the equipment. In weld overlay cladding, the clad metal layer is deposited on the base metal using arc-welding type processes.  Weld overlay is a cost-effective technology for complicated shapes, for field service jobs, and for production of some very heavy-wall pressure vessel reactors.  During overlay welding, the cladding metal and base metal are melted together at their interface. The resulting dilution of the cladding metal chemistry may compromise corrosion performance and limit use in certain applications.  Weld metal shrinkage during cooling potentially causes distortion when the base layer is thin.  As with rollbond, weld overlay is limited to metallurgically similar metals, primarily stainless steels and nickel alloys joined to steel.   Weld overlay is typically performed in conventional metal fabrication shops.
Explosion-Welded Metal Cladding.  Competition in the explosion-welded clad metal business is fragmented.  NobelClad holds a strong market position in the clad metal industry. It is the leading producer of explosion-welded clad products in North America, and has a strong position in Europe against smaller competitors. NobelClad’s has mixed competition in Asia ranging from competitors with competitive technology and strong brand names to other producers which are technically limited and offer minimal exports outside of their domestic markets. To remain competitive, NobelClad intends to continue developing and providing technologically advanced manufacturing services, maintaining quality levels, offering flexible delivery schedules, delivering finished products on a reliable basis and competing favorably on the basis of price.
Customer Profile

NobelClad’s products are used in critical applications in a variety of industries, including upstream oil and gas, oil refining, chemical and petrochemical, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, power generation, industrial refrigeration and other similar industries.  NobelClad’s customers in these industries require metal products that can withstand exposure to corrosive materials, high temperatures and high pressures.  NobelClad’s customers can be divided into three tiers: the product end users (e.g., operators of chemical processing plants), the engineering contractors that design and construct 
6

plants for end users, and the metal fabricators that manufacture the products or equipment that utilize NobelClad’s metal products.  It is typically the fabricator that places the purchase order with NobelClad and pays the corresponding invoice.  NobelClad has developed strong relationships over the years with the engineering contractors, process licensors, and equipment operating companies that frequently act as buying agents for fabricators.

Marketing, Sales, Distribution

NobelClad conducts its selling efforts by marketing its services to potential customers' senior management, direct sales personnel, program managers, and independent sales representatives. Prospective customers in specific industries are identified through networking in the industry, cooperative relationships with suppliers, public relations, customer references, inquiries from technical articles and seminars and trade shows.  NobelClad’s sales office in the United States covers the Americas and East Asia.  Its sales offices in Europe cover the full European continent, Africa, the Middle East, India, and Southeast Asia.  NobelClad also has sales offices in South Korea and China to address these markets. These sales teams are further supported by local sales offices in the Middle East and India, with contract agents in most other developed countries, including Russia and Brazil.  Contract agents typically work under multi-year agreements which are subject to sales performance as well as compliance with NobelClad quality and customer service expectations.  Members of the global sales team may be called to work on projects located outside their usual territory.  By maintaining relationships with its existing customers, developing new relationship with prospective customers, and educating all its customers as to the technical benefits of NobelClad’s products, NobelClad endeavors to assist in the writing of specifications, both by our customers and American Society of Mechanical Engineers and ASTM industry standards, to ensure that the highest quality and reliability are achieved.

NobelClad’s products are generally shipped from its manufacturing locations in the United States, Germany and France.  Any shipping costs or duties for which NobelClad is responsible typically will be included in the price paid by the customer.  Regardless of where the sale is booked, NobelClad will produce it, capacity permitting, at the location closest to the delivery place. In the event that there is a short-term capacity issue, NobelClad produces the order at any of its production sites, prioritizing timing.  The various production sites allow NobelClad to meet customer production needs in a timely manner.

Research and Development

We prepare a formal research and development plan annually. It is implemented at our cladding sites in France, Germany, and the U.S. and is supervised by a Technical Committee that reviews progress quarterly and meets once a year to establish the plan for the following 12 months.  The research and development projects concern process support, new products, and special customer-paid projects.
DynaEnergetics
DynaEnergetics designs, manufactures, markets, and sells perforating explosives and associated hardware, as well as seismic explosives, for the international oil and gas industry. The oil and gas industry uses perforating products to punch holes in the casing or liner of wells, thereby connecting the well to the surrounding reservoir. During the drilling process, steel casing and cement are inserted into the well to isolate and support the wellbore. As part of the well completion process, the perforating guns, which contain a series of specialized shaped charges, are lowered into the well to the desired area of the targeted formation. When fired, the shaped charges shoot a plasma jet through the casing and cement and into the formation. The resulting channels in the formation allow hydrocarbons to flow into the wellbore.
7

DynaEnergetics designs, manufactures and sells all five primary components of a perforating system, which are: 1) carrier tubes and charge tubes, 2) shaped charges, 3) detonating cord, 4) detonators, and 5) control panels. In addition, DynaEnergetics has leveraged its broad product portfolio and detonator technology to create a unique factory-assembled, performance-assured well perforating system known as DynaStageTM. The DynaStage system arrives fully assembled at the well, thereby reducing the customers’ need for field assembly crews and associated infrastructure. 
PRIMARY COMPONENTS OF A PERFORATING GUN
The perforating products manufactured by DynaEnergetics are essential to certain types of modern oil and gas recovery.  These products are sold to large, mid-sized, and small oilfield service companies around the world. DynaEnergetics also promotes its technologies and systems directly with end-user exploration and production companies. The market for perforating products, which are used during the well completion process, generally corresponds with oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) activity. Modern E&P activity has led to increasingly complex well completion operations, which in turn, have increased the demand for high quality and technically advanced perforating products.
Operations
The DynaEnergetics segment seeks to build on its products and technologies, as well as its sales, supply chain and distribution network.  During the three years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the DynaEnergetics segment represented approximately 42%, 46% and 52% of our consolidated net sales, respectively.  
DynaEnergetics has been producing detonating cord and detonators and selling these along with seismic explosives systems for decades. Since 1994, the business has placed significant emphasis on enhancing its offering by improving existing products and adding new products through research and development, as well as acquisitions.  Today, DynaEnergetics offers a comprehensive portfolio of detonating cord, detonators, bi-directional boosters, shaped charges, and corresponding gun systems.
In recent years, DynaEnergetics has increased its development efforts and introduced several new products specifically designed for safe and selective perforating. Included among these products is the DynaSelectTM family of intrinsically safe integrated switch-detonators. DynaSelect detonators require a specific electronic code for firing and are immune to induced currents and voltages, static electricity and high-frequency irradiation. These safety features substantially reduce the risk of unintentional detonation and enable concurrent perforating and hydraulic fracturing operations at drilling sites with multiple wellbores, improving operating efficiencies for customers.

Our DynaSelect products integrate our earlier Selectronic Switches with our Intrinsically Safe Detonator technologies in a unique one-piece system for improved well site efficiency, reliability, simplicity and service quality. The fully integrated design incorporates advanced software controls and reduces the size of the detonator and switch assembly. DynaSelect reduces by 40% the number of electrical connections required within each perforating gun versus prior detonator models. This improves set-up times and significantly increases reliability. The DynaSelect detonator is controlled by our Mulitronic IV Firing Panel. This system enables safe and reliable firing of up to 20 guns in a single run and incorporates a signal output function to monitor the movement and position of the tool string, resulting in significant time and cost savings.
Our DynaStageTM factory-assembled, quality assured, perforating system combines all our advanced technologies into a preassembled perforating gun that can be armed at the well site with the wireless DynaStage detonator, which incorporates all of the features of the intrinsically safe DynaSelect detonator. The DynaStage system is operated using our latest Multitronic V Firing Panel, and can be tested before going down hole using our Surface Tester. The Multitronic V Firing Panel is highly intuitive and allows the gun string to be safely tested and monitored throughout the pump-down operation. The Multitronic V panel introduces several new features designed to ease the use and the reliability of the system, including “shoot-on-the-fly” operation through an instant-fire capability. By safely checking perforating guns on the surface, the DynaStage Surface Tester greatly reduces the risk of lost time, mishaps, misruns and misfires due to a system fault. The Surface Tester is fully RP67 compliant and cannot initiate any type of detonator or explosive device. The patent-pending plug-n-go design of the DynaStage wireless detonator reduces the potential for errors by eliminating the need for wiring and crimping. The fully integrated design of DynaStage minimizes uncertainty and operational risks, achieving industry-leading perforating performance. 
Our DynaSlotTM perforating system is designed for well abandonment operations. During abandonment the wellbore is encased and permanently sealed so that layers of sedimentary rock, and in particular freshwater aquifers, are pressure isolated from the wellbore. The DynaSlot perforating system facilitates this process by creating access to a full 360-degree area between the rock formations and the tubing and casing. Customers use the unique, helical perforation pattern created by DynaSlot to perform cement squeeze operations that seal off the wellbore.
DynaEnergetics develops and sells a wide range of shaped charges for use in its perforating systems. These include the family of HaloFrac™ charges, which incorporate advancements in liner materials and shaped charge geometry designed to improve hydraulic fracturing performance through lower and more consistent breakdown pressures, uniform proppant placement, uniform frac clusters and higher well productivity ratios. Another line, FracTune™, delivers uniform hole diameter in the well casing independent of shot phasing and gun positioning within the well bore.  DynaEnergetics also sells the DPEX™ family of charges, which feature energetic liners. All three lines can be used with the DynaStage perforating system, as well as conventional perforating gun systems across a range of gun diameters.
DynaEnergetics Tubing Conveyed Perforating, (TCP) systems are customized for individual customer needs and well applications. TCP enables perforating of more complex highly deviated and horizontal wells. These types of wells are increasingly being drilled by the industry. TCP tools also perforate long intervals in a single trip, which significantly improves rig efficiency. Our TCP tool range includes mechanical and hydraulic firing systems, gun releases, under-balancing devices and auxiliary components. Our tools are designed to withstand downhole temperatures of up to 260 degrees Celsius (500 degrees Fahrenheit), for safe and quick assembly at the well site, and to allow unrestricted total system length. 
DynaEnergetics’ manufacturing facilities are located in Germany, the United States and Russia. During 2013 DynaEnergetics completed a new shaped charge manufacturing facility in Blum, Texas and a perforating gun manufacturing facility in Tyumen, Siberia. The construction of a new shaped charge manufacturing facility in Tyumen, Siberia, was completed in 2015, and in 2016, we received all the necessary permits to start production of charges. The facility was fully operational by the end of the third quarter 2016. These investments have significantly expanded our global capacity for shaped charge and perforating gun production and improve our delivery and customer service capabilities in these two key markets.

Suppliers and Raw Materials

Competition
DynaEnergetics faces competition from independent producers of perforating products and from each of the industry's three largest oil and gas service companies, which produce most of their own shaped charges but also buy other perforating components and specialty products from independent suppliers such as DynaEnergetics.  DynaEnergetics competes for sales primarily on customer service, product quality, reliability, safety, performance, price and, in North America, proximity of distribution centers to oilfield drilling activity.
Customer Profile
DynaEnergetics' perforating and seismic products are purchased by international and regional oilfield service companies of all sizes working in both onshore and offshore oil and gas fields. Our customers select perforating products based on their leading performance, system compatibility and ability to address a broad spectrum of factors, including pressures and temperatures in the borehole and geological characteristics of the targeted formation.

The customers for our oilfield products can be divided into four broad categories: purchasing centers of large service companies, international service companies, oil companies with and without their own service companies, and local resellers.  
Marketing, Sales, Distribution
DynaEnergetics’ worldwide marketing and sales efforts for its oilfield and seismic products are located in Troisdorf, Germany, Houston, Texas, and Tyumen, Siberia.  DynaEnergetics’ sales strategy focuses on direct selling, distribution through licensed distributors and independent sales representatives, the establishment of international distribution centers to better service our customers, and educating current and potential customers about our products and technologies.  Currently, DynaEnergetics sells its oilfield and seismic products through wholly owned affiliates in Germany, the U.S., Canada, Russia and Kazakhstan, and through independent sales agents in other parts of the world.  DynaEnergetics serves the Americas region through its network of sales and distributions centers in the United States and Canada. 
DynaEnergetics also designs and manufactures customized perforating products for third-party customers according to their designs and requirements.
Research and Development
DynaEnergetics attaches great importance to its research and development capabilities and has devoted substantial resources to its R&D programs.  Based predominantly in Troisdorf, Germany, the R&D team works closely with sales, product management, and operations management teams to establish priorities and effectively manage individual projects.  Through its ongoing involvement in oil and gas industry trade shows and conferences, DynaEnergetics has increased its profile in the oil and gas industry.  An R&D Plan, which focuses on new technology, products, process support and contracted projects, is prepared and reviewed at least quarterly. Research and development costs are included in our cost of products sold and were $4.0 million, $2.4 million, and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Corporate History and Recent Developments

The genesis of the Company was an unincorporated business called “Explosive Fabricators,” which was formed in Colorado in 1965.  The business was incorporated in Colorado in 1971 under the name “E. F. Industries, Inc.,” which was later changed to “Explosive Fabricators, Inc.”  The Company became publicly traded in 1976.  In 1994, it changed its name to “Dynamic Materials Corporation.”  The Company reincorporated in Delaware in 1997.

In 1976, the Company became a licensee of Detaclad, the explosion-welded clad process developed by DuPont in 1959.  In 1996, the Company purchased the Detaclad operating business from DuPont.
In 1998, the Company acquired AMK Technical Services ("AMK"), a specialty welding business.
In 2001, the Company acquired substantially all of the stock of Nobelclad Europe SA, a French company (“NobelClad France”).  Early in its history, NobelClad France was a licensee of the Detaclad technology.  The acquisition of NobelClad France expanded the Company’s explosive metalworking operations to Europe.

In 2007, the Company acquired the German company DynaEnergetics GmbH and Co. KG (“DynaEnergetics”) and certain affiliates.  DynaEnergetics was comprised of two primary businesses: explosive metalworking and oilfield products.  
10

This acquisition expanded the Company’s explosive metalworking operations in Europe and added a complementary oilfield products business.

Over the next several years the Company further grew the DynaEnergetics business by acquiring additional related sales and manufacturing companies in Canada and the United States and purchasing minority interests in certain Russian joint ventures.

In 2013, the Company branded its explosive metalworking operations under the single name NobelClad.  The NobelClad segment is comprised of the Company’s U.S. clad operations as well as the explosion metalworking assets and operations purchased in the NobelClad France and DynaEnergetics acquisitions.  In 2014, the Company re-branded the oilfield products segment as DynaEnergetics, which is comprised entirely of DynaEnergetics (other than its explosion metalworking operations), its subsidiaries and sister companies.  
In 2014, the Company sold AMK. Also in 2014, the Company acquired a modern manufacturing and office complex in Liebenscheid, Germany. The facility enhances NobelClad's manufacturing capabilities and serves as a state-of-the-art production and administrative resource for NobelClad's European operations.
In 2016, the Company changed its name to DMC Global Inc., as it is no longer a materials company as implied by the name Dynamic Materials Corporation but is instead the parent company to a diversified portfolio of technical product and process businesses serving niche markets around the world.
Employees

As of December 31, 2016, we had 428 employees (200 U.S. and 228 non-U.S.), the majority of whom are engaged in manufacturing operations, with the remainder primarily in sales, marketing and administrative functions. Most of our manufacturing employees are not unionized.  In addition, we use a number of temporary workers at any given time, depending on the workload.

In the last three years, the Company has experienced two work stoppages, which lasted for three days in November 2014 and eight days in December 2014, at NobelClad's production facility in Rivesaltes, France. The stoppages related to a consolidation program of NobelClad's European explosion welding operations. A restructuring agreement with the labor union at Rivesaltes was reached in January 2015, at which point work was restarted.  We currently believe that employee relations are good.
