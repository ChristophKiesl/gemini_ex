Item 1. Business
Our customers have bold aspirations—the drive to be their own boss, write their own story and take a leap of faith to pursue their dreams. Launching that brewery, running that wedding planning service, organizing that fundraiser, expanding that web-design business or whatever sparks their passion. We are inspired by our customers, and are dedicated to helping them turn their powerful ideas into meaningful action. Our vision is to radically shift the global economy toward life-fulfilling independent ventures.
Overview
Our nearly 15 million customers are people and organizations with vibrant ideas—businesses, both large and small, entrepreneurs, universities, charities and hobbyists. They are defined by their guts, grit and determination to transform their ideas into something meaningful. They wear many hats and juggle many responsibilities, and they need to make the most of their time. Our customers need help navigating today's dynamic Internet environment and want the benefits of the latest technology to help them succeed. We are a trusted partner and champion for organizations of all sizes in their quest to build successful online ventures.
We are a leading technology provider to small businesses, web design professionals and individuals, delivering simple, easy-to-use cloud-based products and outcome-driven, personalized Customer Care. We operate the world's largest domain marketplace, where our customers can find that unique piece of digital real estate perfectly matching their idea. We provide website building, hosting and security tools to help customers easily construct and protect their online presence. As our customers grow, we provide applications and access to relevant third party products helping them connect to their customers, manage and grow their businesses and get found online.
Our customers need help navigating today's dynamic Internet environment and want the benefits of the latest technology to help them succeed. The increase in broadband penetration, mobile device usage and the need for presence across search engines, content destinations, listing providers (e.g. Yelp), e-commerce sites and social media channels create both opportunities and challenges for them. We offer products and solutions to help our customers tackle this rapidly changing technology landscape. We develop the majority of our products internally and believe our solutions are among the best in the industry in terms of breadth, performance, functionality and ease of use.
Often technology companies force their customers to choose between technology and support, delivering one but not the other. At GoDaddy, we don't believe our customers should have to choose and strive to deliver both great technology and great customer support. We believe engaging with our customers in a proactive, consultative way helps them knock down the technology hurdles they face. Through the thousands of conversations we have with our customers every day, we receive valuable feedback enabling us to continually evolve our products and solutions and respond to their changing needs.
Our people and unique culture have been integral to our success. We live by the same principles that enable new ventures to survive and thrive: hard work, perseverance, conviction, an obsession with customer satisfaction and a belief that no one can do it better. We take responsibility for driving successful outcomes and are accountable to our customers, which we believe has been a key factor in enabling our rapid customer and revenue growth. We believe we have one of the most recognized technology brands in the U.S.
Our Size and Scale
Our combination of easy-to-use cloud-based products, personalized Customer Care, a powerful brand and a unique culture have helped us build an attractive business with strong financial performance.

• | In 2016, we generated $2,155 million in total bookings, up 12.6% (or approximately 13.8% on a constant currency basis) from $1,914 million in 2015. In 2016, we had $1,848 million of revenue, up 15.0% (or approximately 16.7% on a constant currency basis) from $1,607 million in 2015.


• | As of December 31, 2016, we provided localized solutions in 56 markets. For the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 28% of our total bookings were attributable to customers outside of the U.S.


• | Our highly-rated Customer Care team of more than 4,100 specialists, including more than 1,100 outside the U.S., is focused on providing high-quality, personalized care. As a result of their ongoing dialogue with customers, our Customer Care team also drives bookings and in 2016 generated approximately 24% of our total bookings.

Our Market 
Our customers represent a large and diverse market which we believe is largely underserved. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, there were approximately 28 million small businesses in 2012. Based on data from the 2012 U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Small Business Administration, over 85% of small businesses have fewer than five employees and approximately 23 million, or over 75% of, small businesses were non-employer firms. Furthermore, the Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity Report estimated that in 2015 there were approximately 530,000 new business owners created each month in the U.S. Moreover, according to a study performed by the International Finance Corporation and McKinsey Company, there are more than 420 million micro, small and medium enterprises (defined as one to 250 employees) worldwide. We believe our addressable market extends beyond small businesses and includes individuals and organizations, such as universities, charities and hobbyists.
Despite the ubiquity and importance of the Internet to individual consumers, many small businesses and organizations have remained offline given their limited resources and inadequate tools. We believe approximately 60% of small businesses do not have a website. However, as proliferation of mobile devices blurs the online/offline distinction into an "always online" world, having an impactful online presence is becoming a "must have" for small businesses worldwide.
What it means for small businesses and ventures to be online continues to evolve. Only a few years ago, an online presence typically consisted of a simple and static website with basic information, perhaps supported by limited search engine marketing. Today, having an effective online presence requires much more, including a secure and content rich website viewable from any device; presence on social media sites and an increasing number of horizontal and vertical marketplaces (e.g. Yelp and OpenTable); branded email communication; online marketing; and Internet-enabled reservation and scheduling capabilities. In addition, other needs such as telephony, invoicing, payment processing, and accounting and tax preparation, which are typically separate point solutions, can now increasingly be linked to the front-end.
The shift toward dynamic online presence for small business has been fueled by the emergence of simple, yet powerful, cloud-based technologies that can easily be utilized by individuals with limited technical skills. Cloud technologies have helped enable the integration of front and back-end activities. Cloud-based products, which can be "rented" on a monthly or yearly basis, allow a business to more easily scale from a nascent idea to a thriving venture. The Parallels SMB Cloud Insights for Global 2014 report estimates the cloud market for small business was $62 billion in 2013, and will double by 2016, growing to $125 billion.
Our Customers
Our customers share common traits, such as tenacity and determination, yet their specific needs vary depending on the type and stage of their ventures. They range from individuals who are thinking about starting a business to established ventures that are up and running but need help attracting customers, growing their sales, managing their business or expanding their operations. While our customers have differing degrees of resources and technical capabilities, they all share a desire to bring their ideas to life. Our customers are united by a number of common characteristics: entrepreneurial spirit, strong work ethic and, above all, passion for their ventures.
Our target customers are primarily local service-based businesses. Most of our customers have fewer than five employees and most identify themselves as having little to no technology skills. They need our help to give their businesses a unique and secure digital identity and tools to help them stay connected with their customers.
6

To serve our customers well at every phase of their ventures, we group them into multiple stages of growth, starting with "nascent" and evolving to "established and content." We have also identified special groups like the "digital commerce" group, which is made up of web-savvy individuals who utilize digital commerce platforms as their primary business vehicles. We also serve a group of customers consisting of web-designers and web-developers—who we call "Web Pros"—who are in the business of building, designing and managing the online presence of others. Each of these groups is unique in their needs, and we personalize our solutions to meet them at each stage in their lifecycle.
Our Opportunity—What Successful Ventures Need
Our customers are consumers themselves and use the Internet to get informed, research and shop for solutions, which makes them keenly aware of the need to have an impactful online presence. While our customers' needs change depending on where they are in their lifecycle, the most common customer needs we serve include:

• | Getting online and looking great. Our customers want to find a name perfectly identifying their business, hobby or passion. Once they have a name, they want to create a digital identity so their customers can find, engage and transact with them online. We believe a complete digital identity includes an elegant, mobile-enabled website and the ability to get found across various search engines, social media platforms and vertical marketplaces.


• | Growing their business and running their operations. Our customers need to communicate with their existing customers and find new customers. They also need tools to help them run their businesses, from telephony, productivity and marketing tools to getting paid and balancing their books. In today's online world, these activities can now increasingly be linked to a customer's online presence.


• | Easy-to-use products with help from a real person when needed. Our customers want easy-to-use products and sometimes they need help from real people to set up their website, launch a new feature or try something new. We build products that are intuitive for beginners to use, yet robust and feature-rich to address the needs of expert designers and power-users. We also provide high quality, consultative Customer Care and advise our customers as needed.


• | Technology that grows with them. Our customers need a simple platform and set of tools enabling their domain, website and other solutions to easily work together as their venture grows and becomes more complex. The right platform can meet the needs of both an entrepreneur who is not technologically savvy and a Web Pro with a more complex set of requirements.


• | Reliability, security and performance. Our customers expect reliable products and want to be confident their digital presence is secure. Our customers work on their ventures whenever and however they can and need solutions fitting their lifestyle and schedule.


• | Affordable solutions. Our customers often have limited financial resources and are unable to make large, upfront investments in the latest technology. Our customers need affordable solutions leveling the playing field and giving them the tools to look and act like bigger ventures.

Our Solution—What We Do and How We Do It 
We built GoDaddy to serve our customers by providing elegant, easy-to-use cloud-based products wrapped with personalized Customer Care. Our customers turn to us in order to:

• | Get a great domain name. Every great idea needs a great name. Staking a claim with a domain name has become the first step in establishing an idea and presence online. When inspiration strikes, we are there to provide our customers with high-quality search, discovery and recommendation tools as well as the broadest selection of domains to help them find the right name for their venture.


• | Turn their domain into a dynamic online presence. Our products, including GoCentral, enable anyone to build an elegant website or online store, for both desktop and mobile, regardless of technical skill. Our products, powered by a unified cloud platform, enable our customers to get found online by helping to enhance the information on their website and extending their website and its content to where they need to be, from search engine results (e.g. Google) to social media (e.g. Facebook) to vertical marketplaces (e.g. Yelp and FourSquare), all from one location. For more technically-sophisticated web designers, developers and customers, we provide high-performance, flexible hosting and security products that can be used with a variety of open source design tools. We design these solutions to be easy to use, effective, reliable, flexible and a great value.

• | Add back-office and marketing products. Our customers want to spend their time on what matters most to them, selling their products or services or helping their customers do the same. We provide them with productivity tools such as domain-specific email, online storage and invoicing and payment solutions to help run their ventures. We also provide robust marketing products, such as email marketing, to help them attract and retain customers.


• | Use our products together in a solution that grows with our customers over time. Our API-driven technology platform is built on state-of-the-art, open source technologies like Hadoop, OpenStack and other large-scale, distributed systems. Simply put, we believe our products work well together and are more valuable and easier to use together than if our customers purchased them individually from other companies and tried to integrate them. Additionally, our platform allows our developers to innovate new and enhanced products or product features assembled from common building blocks leading to faster deployment cycles.


• | Receive assistance from our highly-rated Customer Care team. Our Customer Care team consists of more than 4,100 specialists who are available 24/7/365 and are capable of providing care to customers having different levels of technical sophistication. Our specialists are evaluated on customer outcomes and the quality of the experience they provide. We strive to provide high-quality, consultative care and deliver a distinctive experience helping us create loyal customers who renew their subscriptions, purchase additional products and refer their family and friends to us.


• | Utilize a reliable, secure, global technology platform and infrastructure. In 2016, we handled on average nearly 18 billion DNS queries per day and hosted approximately 10 million websites on servers located throughout our worldwide data centers. We focus on online security, customer privacy and reliable infrastructure to address the evolving needs of our customers.


• | Receive high value. We price most of our products at a few dollars per month while providing our customers with robust features and functionality. We believe our high-quality products and personalized Customer Care provide our customers with an affordable bridge between their available resources and their aspirations.

Our Advantages—Why We Win
We believe the following strengths provide us with competitive advantages in realizing the potential of our opportunity:

• | We are the leading domain name marketplace, a key on-ramp in establishing a digital identity. We are the global market leader in domain name registration. According to VeriSign's Domain Name Industry Brief, we held over 19% of the approximately 335 million worldwide domain names under management as of June 30, 2016.

• | We operate an industry-leading Customer Care team that also drives bookings. We give our customers much more than typical customer support. Our team is unique, blending personalized Customer Care with the ability to evaluate our customers' needs, which allows us to help and advise them as well as drive incremental bookings. Our Customer Care team contributed approximately 24% of our total bookings in 2016. Our customers respond to our personalized approach with high marks for customer satisfaction. Our proactive Customer Care model is a key component helping create long-term customer relationships, which is reflected in our high retention rates.


• | Our brand and marketing efficiency. We believe GoDaddy is one of the most recognized technology brands in the U.S. Through a combination of cost-effective direct-marketing, brand advertising and customer referrals, we have increased our total customers from 10.2 million as of December 31, 2012 to 14.7 million as of December 31, 2016.


• | Our financial model. Our stable and predictable business model is driven by efficient customer acquisition, high customer retention rates and increasing lifetime spend.

• | In the five years ended December 31, 2016, we invested to support our growth with $1,190 million in technology and development expenses and $871 million in marketing and advertising expenses.

Our Strategy—How We Grow
We are pursuing the following principal strategies to drive our business:

• | Expand and innovate our product offerings. Our product innovation priorities include:


• | Delivering the next generation of naming. The first generation of naming included a limited set of generic top-level domains (gTLDs), such as .com and .net, and country code top-level domains (ccTLDs), such as .uk and .in. With approximately 335 million existing domains registered, it may be increasingly difficult for customers to find the name best suiting their needs. As a result, ICANN began introducing more than 1,300 new gTLDs in late 2013. We merchandise hundreds of these newer gTLDs, including new generic options (e.g. .shop and .blog) as well as names geared toward professions (e.g. .photography), personal interests (e.g. .club), geographies (e.g. .london, .nyc and .vegas) and just plain fun (e.g. .ninja). Additionally, we have invested to expand the secondary market to help match buyers to sellers who already own domains. Our GoDaddy Investor mobile application helps investors watch and bid on domains at auction and stay on top of current bids from their mobile devices. We continue to invest in search, discovery and recommendation tools and transfer protocols for both primary and secondary domains.


• | Powering elegant and effortless presence. We continue to invest in tools, templates and technology to make building, maintaining and updating a professional looking mobile or desktop website simple and easy. Additionally, we are investing in products to help our customers drive their customer acquisition efforts by managing their presence across search engines, social networks and vertical marketplaces and keep their online presence and information secure. We recently launched GoCentral, a new service combining a mobile-optimized website builder with an integrated set of marketing and e-commerce tools to help our customers create an audience for their idea or business, enabling them to design a professional website in under an hour.


• | Making the business of business easy. Our business applications range from domain-specific email and email marketing to telephony services and payment tools to help our customers communicate with their customers and grow their ventures. We intend to continue investing in the breadth of our product offerings to help our customers connect with their customers and run their ventures.


• | Win the Web Pros. We are investing in building a suite of tools and services for web designers and developers to help them save time, make money and exceed client expectations. These client management tools include administrative access and shopping features making it easier for designers and developers to buy and manage products for their clients. We have further bolstered our Web Pro-focused suite through recent acquisitions, strengthening our site management capabilities and technical support and extending our reach into the WordPress community.


• | Go global. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 34% of our customers were located in international markets, notably Canada, India and the United Kingdom. We have made significant investments in the localization of our service offerings in markets outside of the U.S. and, as of December 31, 2016, we offered localized products and Customer Care in 56 markets. To support our international growth, we will continue investing to develop our local capabilities across products, marketing programs, data centers and Customer Care. Our recent international acquisitions, including our proposed acquisition of HEG, are an important part of this international growth.


• | Partner up. Our flexible platform also enables us to acquire companies and quickly launch new products for our customers, including through partnerships such as Microsoft Office 365 for email and PayPal for payments. We have

9

also acquired companies and technologies to complement our product and service offerings and expand our geographic footprint. We intend to continue identifying value-added technology acquisition targets and partnership opportunities.

• | Make it personal. We seek to leverage data and insights to personalize the product and Customer Care experiences of our customers as well as tailor our solutions and marketing efforts to each of our customer groups. We are constantly seeking to improve our website, marketing programs and Customer Care to intelligently reflect where customers are in their lifecycle and identify their specific product needs. We intend to continue investing in our technology and data platforms to further enable our personalization efforts.


• | Wrap it with Care. We believe our highly-rated Customer Care team is distinctive and essential to the lifetime value proposition we offer our customers. We continue to invest in our Customer Care team, including investing to expand our Customer Care service, improve the quality of our Customer Care resources and introduce enhanced tools and processes across our expanding global footprint.

Products
We have designed and developed an extensive set of easy-to-use cloud-based technology products enabling our customers to establish a digital presence, connect with their customers and manage their ventures. We understand our customers' needs vary depending on the type and stage of their venture, which is why we offer our products both independently and bundled as suites of integrated products designed for specific activities.
Our domain name registration products enable us to engage customers at the initial stage of establishing a digital identity and act as an on-ramp for our other products. We believe our hosting, presence and business applications products increase our revenue and margin growth opportunities, frequently serve as starting points for our customer relationships, improve customer retention and significantly improve our value proposition to customers.
Domains
We are the global market leader in domain name registration. Securing a domain is a necessary first step to creating a digital identity and our domain products often serve as the starting point in our customer relationships. As of December 31, 2016, more than 93% of our customers had purchased a domain from us, and as of December 31, 2016, we had more than 63 million domains under management. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, we generated approximately 50%, 52% and 55% of our total revenue, respectively, from sales of our domain products.
Our primary domains product offerings are:
Primary Registrations. Using our website or mobile application, we offer customers the ability to search for and register available domain names, or primary registrations, with the relevant registry. Our inventory for primary registrations is defined by the number of top-level domains (TLDs) we offer. As of December 31, 2016, 391 different gTLDs (e.g. .com, .net and .org) and 50 different ccTLDs (e.g. .de, .ca, .in and .jp.) were available for purchase through our primary registration product. Since 2013, new gTLDs have been periodically launched, including names geared toward professions (e.g. .photography), personal interests (e.g. .guru), geographies (e.g. .london, .nyc and .vegas) and just plain fun (e.g. .ninja). These new gTLDs make it easier for companies and individuals to find and register new, easy-to-remember domain names tailored to their ventures, industry or interests that may not have been available in the relatively crowded, traditional gTLDs such as .com. ccTLDs are important to our international expansion efforts as we have found international customers often prefer the ccTLD for the country or geographic market in which they operate. Our primary registration offering relies heavily on our search, discovery and recommendation tools which enable our customers to find a name matching their needs. We also sell domain registrations through relationships with third-party resellers.
Aftermarket. We operate the world's largest domain aftermarket which processes aftermarket, or secondary, domain name sales. Our aftermarket platform, which we substantially supplemented through our acquisition of Afternic in 2013, is designed to enable the seamless purchase and sale of an already registered domain name through an online auction, an offer and counter-offer transaction or a "buy now" transaction. In 2015 and 2016, we acquired more than 430,000 domain names to increase the inventory available to our customers. In January 2016, we launched the GoDaddy Investor mobile application to help investors watch and bid on domains at auction and stay on top of their current bids, all from their mobile devices. We operate a cross-registrar network that automates transaction execution across registrars thereby reducing the time required to complete a transaction. We receive a percentage of the sales price for each domain sold.
10

Domain Name Add-Ons. Domain name add-ons are features a customer can add to a domain name registration. Our domain name privacy product allows our customers to register a domain name on an "unlisted" basis. This product helps prevent privacy intrusions, helps deter domain related spam and allows our customers to confidentially secure a domain for an unannounced product, service or idea. Domain name add-ons are typically purchased concurrently with domain name registrations and have minimal costs associated with their delivery.
Hosting and Presence
We offer a variety of hosting and presence products enabling our customers to create and manage their digital identity, or in the case of Web Pros, the digital identities of their end-customers. As of December 31, 2016, we hosted approximately 10 million websites. In each of 2016, 2015 and 2014, we derived approximately 37% of our total revenue from sales of our hosting and presence products.
Our primary hosting products are:
Shared Website Hosting. The term "shared hosting" refers to the housing of multiple websites on the same server via the use of chroot environments. Shared hosting is our most popular hosting product. We operate, maintain and support shared website hosting in our owned and operated data center and our leased co-located data center facilities using either Linux or Windows operating systems. We currently offer three tiers of shared website hosting plans to suit the needs and resources of our customers, all of which use industry standard cPanel or Parallels Plesk control panels. We also bundle our hosting plans with a variety of applications and products such as web analytics and SSL certificates.
Website Hosting on Virtual Private Servers and Virtual Dedicated Servers. Our broad range of virtual private server and virtual dedicated server offerings allows our customers to select the server configuration best suited for their applications, requirements and growth. Our virtual private server offering provides customers with a single virtual machine running on a single bare metal server that is running multiple other virtual machines for other customers. Our virtual private server product is designed to meet the requirements of customers with a need for greater control, more advanced technical capabilities and higher performance than that offered by our shared hosting plans. For those customers who have a need for dedicated resources, we created our virtual dedicated server product, providing customers with a single tenant virtual machine housed on a bare metal server reserved exclusively for their use. Our customers have the ability to tailor their virtual dedicated server plan based on a range of performance, storage, bandwidth and operating system.
Managed Hosting. With our managed hosting products, we set up, monitor, maintain, secure and patch software and servers for our customers. We offer a variety of managed hosting plans to support our customers' needs including multiple tiers of Managed WordPress hosting on a platform optimized for WordPress. We also offer other managed environments that span across our VPS and Dedicated products like Joomla, Drupal and Magento and apps like Gallery. In addition to managed hosting plans tailored to our customers' needs, we also offer expert services, which provide additional support services at a fixed hourly rate.
Security. Our security products include secure sockets layer certificates (SSLs), malware scanners and malware removal. According to Netcraft, we are one of the world's largest provider of SSLs. An SSL validates a customer's website identity and encrypts online transactional information, such as credit card information, and communications sent to or by the website. We offer a variety of SSLs all of which provide high-grade, 256-bit encryption. Our SSL offerings include multiple domain SSLs and "wildcard" SSLs, which secure a singular website URL as well as subdomains on that URL (e.g. protectmyvisitors.com and cart.protectmyvisitors.com). We also offer "code signing certificates" designed to prove the identity of software authors and validate that the software has not been tampered with since its original distribution.
Our primary presence products are:
Website Builder. Our Website Builder is an easy-to-use, do-it-yourself online tool enabling customers, irrespective of their technical skills, to build elegant websites. We offer a variety of plans, with pricing dependent on the number of available design styles and desired business and marketing features. With each of these plans, customers have access to hundreds of professional designs which can be further customized using our drag-and-drop editor by adding photos, graphics or text. Our designs cover a wide range of categories with professionally written content for small businesses, organizations, families, athletic teams, weddings, reunions and other interest groups. Once built, websites can be easily connected to social profiles, such as Facebook and Twitter, and optimized for search engines. Our customers are also able to receive a mobile-optimized version of their website through Website Builder.
11

E-commerce. Our online store product allows customers to easily create their own standalone website with an integrated online store optimized for mobile shopping, which allows customers to showcase products, manage inventory and shipping and securely accept payments via credit card, Apple Pay or PayPal. The online store also provides integrated tools for customers to maximize their sales via Google, email marketing and Facebook.
Search Engine Visibility. Search Engine Visibility (SEV) helps our customers get their websites found on major search sites through search engine optimization. SEV offers a simple step-by-step wizard giving targeted recommendations on which search phrases are most likely to drive traffic to a customer's site. We have built a ground-up system that helps our customers receive specific recommendations on keywords and content. Customers who are using a domain name and DNS purchased from GoDaddy can also automatically apply updates with one click, meaning they never have to touch a line of code.
Business Applications 
We offer a variety of products designed to make the business of business easier for our customers. The products we offer include those developed in-house as well as third-party applications which we distribute and support, such as Microsoft Office 365. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, we derived approximately 13%, 11% and 8% of our total revenue, respectively, from sales of our business applications products.
Our primary business applications products are:
Microsoft Office 365. We offer fully-supported Microsoft Office 365 email accounts that are easy to set up and use with our customers' domains. We offer Microsoft Office 365 in multiple plans ranging from email with calendar and contacts connected to a custom domain to a full suite of productivity tools, including file sharing and full desktop versions of applications, including Outlook, Word, Excel and PowerPoint. For customers needing to comply with regulatory requirements, we offer email add-on services such as HIPPA-enabled email, encryption services (in partnership with ProofPoint) and archiving services (in partnership with Sonian). Microsoft Office 365 is easy to set up and can be up and running in minutes.
Email Accounts. We offer a range of email service plans that connect to our customers' domains. Some of these plans include a multi-feature web interface, an integrated calendar and secure online storage. The pricing of these plans depends on the customer's desired amount of storage and number of email addresses. All of our email accounts are advertising-free and include security functionality designed to provide protection from spam, viruses and other forms of online fraud, such as phishing.
Email Marketing. Our email marketing product helps customers market their businesses through permission-based email. Customers can easily create and send newsletters, targeted advertising campaigns, promotions and surveys as well as connect email campaigns with their social media networks and track the results of campaigns.
Telephony. Through our 2016 acquisition of Freedom Voice, we provide internet-based telephone services that can be accessed with either IP phones, or traditional local or cellular telephone services. Some of our telephone plans include additional services, such as voicemail, a virtual receptionist, a customizable phone tree, voicemail transcription, follow-me call forwarding, fax on demand and email delivery of voicemail. We expect to launch expanded telephony services through our Smartline offering during the second quarter of 2017.
Technology and Infrastructure
Our technology platform forms the core of many of our solutions, and we have invested significantly to develop a platform designed to be intelligent, fast, secure and scalable. Our technology and development expenses, including those expenses related to our technology platform, were $288 million, $270 million and $251 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We have built a scalable platform allowing us to provide faster business insights at lower costs, develop and introduce new products quickly and leverage economies of scale to reduce costs and enable next-generation hosting architecture. Our technology stack, which includes physical infrastructure, Infrastructure-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service, applications and data science, allows our customers to build and manage their digital identities and enable access across multiple devices. We seek to continuously enhance the performance and reliability of our technology infrastructure by investing in faster data centers, improved network connectivity and improved resiliency, both domestically and internationally.
Physical infrastructure
Our physical technology infrastructure includes servers located throughout 12 data centers around the world. We have also invested significantly in our peering architecture and utilize multiple peering sites allowing us to handle high IP transit traffic 
12

at low bandwidth costs. Our large technology infrastructure footprint allows us to leverage economies of scale through low server, network, storage and processing costs by commoditizing hardware across various systems and leveraging virtualization where possible.
Infrastructure-as-a-Service
We leverage an Infrastructure-as-a-Service model geared toward the virtualization and automation of common physical data center components like servers, load balancers, switches and storage. We use open source solutions when possible to automate manual processes and thereby reduce the risk of human error as well as to lower costs. Additionally, we are beginning to use a single automated infrastructure based on OpenStack to enable next-generation services.
Platform-as-a-Service
Our cloud platform offers our customers an integrated and comprehensive set of time-saving services. Our platform is designed to help us reduce costs, increase personalization and more easily and quickly build and deploy new products. We continuously invest to develop our platform capabilities and have recently deployed a new authentication platform allowing us to onboard new products more quickly and securely. We have also deployed Cassandra, an open source distributed database management system, across our datacenters for improved customer data replication enabling personalization. We have started to introduce container technology, managed through an orchestration platform, to further simplify and automate how we build and manage services.
Applications 
Our platform is highly-flexible, allowing us to easily integrate third-party offerings and enhance our value proposition to our customers by offering comprehensive and integrated solutions that can be rapidly scaled up or down and used across multiple platforms, including mobile. Our platform also allows resellers to easily sell our products, thereby broadening our distribution channels. We seek to continuously launch new and relevant applications and streamline our existing offerings in order to provide the best user experience to our customers.
Data science
Our data collection technology enables us to collect customer, product and business data from various sources, including web crawling, local listings providers (e.g. Yelp and state business registrations), social platforms (e.g. Facebook and Twitter) and mobile platforms (e.g. geolocation and e-commerce). We use Hadoop, an open source software framework for storage and large-scale processing of data sets, to develop an integrated customer insights data platform. By integrating this data, we are able to offer personalized and intelligent insights and business intelligence to our customers that they can access via dashboards. These dashboards also enhance our ability to develop and offer differentiated products and more intelligent Customer Care. We believe our ability to offer this insight helps us deliver the right solutions targeted to the needs of our customers and attract more businesses to our platform.
Customer Care
We have more than 4,100 Customer Care specialists who provide technical assistance 24/7/365 to customers located around the world. Operating as "business consultants," our specialists advise customers of products best suiting their individual needs. This ability to provide real-time product suggestions while providing a world-class support experience allows our Customer Care team to provide an impactful contribution to bookings through the sale of product subscriptions. Our Customer Care specialists take great pride in owning outcomes and being accountable to our customers, both of which are essential to enhancing customer experience. In each of 2016, 2015 and 2014, at least 23% of our total bookings were generated from the sale of product subscriptions by our Customer Care team. The majority of our Customer Care specialists are located in our Arizona and Iowa facilities in the U.S. We have additional international specialists providing in-region support in native languages. In addition, our easy-to-use website contains extensive educational content designed to demystify the process of establishing an online presence and to assist customers in choosing the products best meeting their needs.
Our Customer Care team spans a variety of channels to provide tailored and timely support to our customers, handling approximately 14 million contacts annually in each of the last three years. Our customers can choose their preferred Customer Care channel, including proactive and reactive chat and phone support. We take a consultative approach to our customers, acting as a trusted partner to guide them through the process with technical solutions supporting them at each phase of their lifecycle and 
13

offer real-time product suggestions best suited to the customers' needs. The effectiveness of our model is reflected in the high ratings we receive from our customers, the bookings generated by our Customer Care team and strong customer referrals.
The strength of our Customer Care team is our people. Our hiring process is extensive and highly selective, designed to yield individuals who will thrive in our team based on core values, character, work ethic and ability. Our new Customer Care hires spend over a month moving from classroom to a live "nesting" environment where they refine their customer and technology skills. With a commitment to life-long learning, we offer hundreds of classes to our employees spanning leadership, sales, service and technology. We have an incentive program that rewards outcomes, across both customer satisfaction and bookings goals. For that and many other reasons, as of December 31, 2016, approximately 40% of our Customer Care specialists had been with us for at least three years.
Marketing
We believe GoDaddy is one of the most recognized technology brands in the U.S. We have established this high level of brand awareness primarily through our advertising campaigns across various platforms including television commercials, print, online and billboards. We have supplemented these advertising campaigns with athlete and celebrity sponsorships. Our strong brand has helped us attract and retain nearly 15 million customers as of December 31, 2016. We intend to continue investing in our brand as we seek to further grow our total customers, particularly internationally. Customer referrals are another highly efficient and cost-effective channel for acquiring customers.
We complement our brand marketing efforts with highly focused and metric-driven direct response marketing to acquire new customers. We use a variety of targeted online marketing programs for lead generation, including search engine marketing, search engine optimization and targeted email and social media marketing campaigns, as well as more traditional direct marketing and indirect channel partner marketing programs, to drive interest in our products and traffic to our websites. As part of this effort, we regularly run numerous campaigns simultaneously and constantly refine our media mix across our channels.
International
Central to our international strategy is a philosophy of localizing our product offerings and deploying them through our global infrastructure. We have nearly 5 million customers outside of the U.S. In 2016, we derived approximately 28% of our total bookings from international sales compared to 26% in 2015 and 25% in 2014. We have devoted substantial, dedicated resources to growing our international presence, leading to the expansion of our localized products and Customer Care to 56 markets as of December 31, 2016. We believe our international scale and growth to date are indicative of the international growth opportunities available to us and position us to continue to grow our business outside the U.S. 
We have built a dedicated team responsible for the internationalization and localization of our core product offerings as well as our Customer Care and marketing efforts. In conjunction with our localization efforts, we have added on-the-ground regional teams and increased our country and regional specific marketing spend. These investments have enabled us to successfully launch and expand our business in select international markets. Our success in these markets has furthered our belief that our international model can work in both established and emerging markets. We have taken a rigorous approach to managing the level of investment we expect to make in each geographic market we enter based on a market tier approach. We expect to continue to expand internationally, growing our share and increasing penetration of the international markets we've entered in recent years, including through our proposed acquisition of HEG.
Competition
We provide cloud-based solutions enabling individuals, businesses and organizations to establish an online presence, connect with customers and manage their ventures. The market for providing these solutions is highly fragmented and competitive. These solutions are also rapidly evolving, creating opportunity for new competitors to enter the market with point-solution products or address specific segments of the market. In some instances, we have commercial partnerships with companies with which we also compete. Given our broad product portfolio, we compete with niche point-solution products and broader solution providers. Our competitors include providers of:

• | domain registration services and web-hosting solutions such as Endurance, Rightside, United Internet and Web.com;


• | website creation and management solutions such as Automattic, Shopify, Squarespace, and Wix;


• | cloud-infrastructure services and online security providers such as Comodo, Symantec, Let's Encrypt and WP Engine;

14


• | alternative web presence and marketing solutions such as Constant Contact, Etsy, OpenTable, Yelp and Zillow; and


• | productivity tools such as business-class email, calendaring and file-sharing such as Dropbox, Microsoft and Google.

We expect continued competition from companies in the domain, hosting and presence markets such as Automattic, Endurance, Rightside, Squarespace, United Internet, Web.com and Wix. We also expect potential increased competition from companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft, which are providers of web-hosting and other cloud-based services. Google has recently entered the domain registration business, with eBay and Facebook both offering robust Internet marketing platforms.
We believe the principal competitive factors include: product capabilities meeting customer requirements, a secure, reliable and integrated technology platform, cost-effective customer acquisition, brand awareness and reputation, customer service and support and overall customer satisfaction. We believe we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors. For additional information, see "Risk Factors."
Regulation
Our business is subject to regulation by ICANN, federal and state laws in the U.S. and the laws of other jurisdictions in which we do business.
ICANN. The registration of domain names is governed by ICANN. ICANN is a multi-stakeholder private sector, not-for-profit corporation formed in 1998 for the express purposes of overseeing a number of Internet related tasks, including management of the DNS, allocation of IP addresses, accreditation of domain name registrars and registries and the definition and coordination of policy development for all of these functions. We are accredited by ICANN as a domain name registrar and thus our ability to offer domain name registration products is subject to our ongoing relationship with and accreditation by ICANN. The regulation of Internet domain names in the U.S. and in foreign countries is subject to change. For example, in 2016, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, or the NTIA, an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, transitioned oversight of key Internet domain name functions to the global multi-stakeholder community. As a result, there is uncertainty at this time concerning the nature and significance of this recent transition from U.S. oversight of ICANN to oversight of ICANN by other bodies.
ccTLD Authorities. The regulation of ccTLDs is governed by national regulatory agencies of the country underlying the specific ccTLDs, such as China (.cn), Canada (.ca) and the United Kingdom (.uk). Our ability to sell ccTLDs is dependent on our and our partners' ability to maintain accreditation in good standing with these various international authorities.
Advertising and promotional information presented on our websites and in our products, and our other marketing and promotional activities, are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws regulating unfair and deceptive practices. U.S. federal, state, and foreign legislatures have also adopted laws and regulations regulating numerous other aspects of our business. Regulations relating to the Internet, including laws governing online content, user privacy, taxation, liability for third-party activities and jurisdiction, are particularly relevant to our business. Such laws and regulations are discussed below.
Communications Decency Act. The CDA regulates content of material on the Internet, and provides immunity to Internet service providers and providers of interactive computer services for certain claims based on content posted by third parties. The CDA and the case law interpreting it generally provide that domain name registrars and website hosting providers cannot be liable for defamatory or obscene content posted by customers on their servers unless they participate in creating or developing the content.
Digital Millennium Copyright Act. The DMCA provides domain name registrars and website hosting providers a safe harbor from liability for third-party copyright infringement. To qualify for the safe harbor, however, registrars and website hosting providers must satisfy numerous requirements, including adoption of a user policy providing for termination of service access of users who are repeat infringers, informing users of this policy, and implementing the policy in a reasonable manner. In addition, registrars and website hosting providers must expeditiously remove or disable access to content upon receiving a proper notice from a copyright owner alleging infringement of its protected works. A registrar or website hosting provider failing to comply with these safe harbor requirements may be found liable for copyright infringement.
Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act. The ACPA was enacted to address piracy on the Internet by curtailing a practice known as "cybersquatting," or the bad-faith registration of a domain name identical or similar to another party's trademark, or to the name of another living person, in order to profit from that name or mark. The ACPA provides that registrars 
15

may not be held liable for damages for registration or maintenance of a domain name for another person absent a showing of the registrar's bad faith intent to profit. Registrars may, however, be held liable if their activities are deemed outside the scope of basic registrar functions.
Lanham Act. The Lanham Act governs trademarks and false advertising. Case law interpreting the Lanham Act has limited liability for many online service providers such as search engines and domain name registrars. Nevertheless, there is no statutory safe harbor for trademark violations comparable to the provisions of the DMCA and we may be subject to a variety of trademark claims in the future.
Privacy and Data Protection. In the areas of personal privacy and data protection, the U.S. federal and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed limitations on, and requirements associated with, the collection, distribution, use, storage, and security of personal information of individuals. If our practices with respect to the collection, distribution, storage, or security of personal information are challenged, we may not be able to demonstrate adequate compliance with existing or future laws or regulations. In addition, in the European Union member states and certain other countries outside the U.S., data protection is more highly regulated and rigidly enforced. As we conduct and expand our business within these countries, we expect compliance with these regulatory schemes to be more burdensome and costly for us.
Laws and regulations relating to our activities are unsettled in many jurisdictions, or may prove difficult or impossible to comply with in some jurisdictions. Additionally, federal, state, local and foreign governments are also considering legislative and regulatory proposals that would regulate the Internet and our activities in more and different ways than exist today. It also is impossible to predict whether new taxes will be imposed on our services, and depending upon the type of such taxes, whether and how we would be affected. Laws and regulations in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions may be applied in new or different manners in pending or future litigation. Further, other existing bodies of law, including the criminal laws of various jurisdictions, may be deemed to apply to our activities, or new statutes or regulations may be adopted in the future.
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
Our intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our business. We rely on a combination of trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality and access-related procedures and safeguards and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technologies, confidential information, brands and other intellectual property.
We have also developed, acquired or licensed proprietary technologies for use in our business. As of December 31, 2016, we had 193 issued patents in the U.S. covering various aspects of our product offerings. Additionally, as of December 31, 2016, we had 186 pending U.S. patent applications and intend to file additional patent applications in the future.
We have non-disclosure, confidentiality and license agreements with employees, contractors, customers and other third parties, which limit access to and use of our proprietary information. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, as well as various procedural safeguards, we believe the skill and ingenuity of our employees, the functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions and our ability to introduce new products and features meeting the needs of our customers are more important to maintaining our competitive position in the marketplace.
We have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names and product names, taglines and logos in the U.S. and other countries to the extent we determine appropriate and cost-effective. We also have common law rights in some unregistered trademarks that were established over years of use. In addition, we have a trademark and service mark enforcement program pursuant to which we monitor applications filed by third parties to register trademarks and service marks that may be confusingly similar to ours, as well as the use of our major brand names in social media, domain names and other Internet sites.
Despite our efforts to preserve and protect our intellectual property, unauthorized third parties may attempt to copy, reverse engineer or otherwise obtain access to our proprietary rights, and competitors may attempt to develop solutions that could compete with us in the markets we serve. Unauthorized disclosure of our confidential information or proprietary technologies by our employees or third parties could also occur. The risk of unauthorized use of our proprietary and intellectual property rights may increase as we continue to expand outside of the U.S.
Third-party infringement claims are also possible in our industry, especially as functionality and features expand, evolve and overlap across industries. Third parties, including non-practicing patent holders, have from time to time claimed, and could claim in the future, that our processes, technologies or websites infringe patents they now hold or might obtain or be issued in the future.
