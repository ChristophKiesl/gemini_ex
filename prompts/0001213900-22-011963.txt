Item 1. Business.
Overview



Our management team has a long history of value creation in the private and public markets. The team is led by our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Mahan, our Co-Chairmen Allen Shapiro and John Howard and our Chief Financial Officer, Hahn Lee. This team has a strong track record of working together to create value for stockholders through acquiring and operating successful businesses within our target sectors. Many of the companies our management team has invested in or operated have been affiliated with celebrity partners. As long-tenured operators and seasoned investors, our executive team has become trusted partners to owners, operators and celebrities. We believe our unique network of relationships and extensive experience sourcing and executing transactions will enhance our ability to complete a successful business combination (as defined below) and accelerate the growth trajectory and profitability of the acquired business post-business combination.



We are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on September 15, 2020, for the purpose of effectuating a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “Business Combination”). While we may pursue an initial Business Combination in any industry or sector, we intend to focus our search for a target business operating in the consumer products and media, entertainment and sports sectors with enterprise valuations in the range of $500 million to $1.5 billion. We are emphasizing (but not limiting ourselves to) businesses that can benefit from celebrity ownership and/or partnership. Our sponsor is Bright Lights Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (our “Sponsor”).



Our registration statement for our initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) was declared effective on January 6, 2021. On January 11, 2021, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 23,000,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the shares of Class A common stock included in the Units sold, the “Public Shares”), which includes the full exercise by the underwriter of its over-allotment option in the amount of 3,000,000 Units, at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $230,000,000.



Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 6,600,000 warrants (each, a “Private Placement Warrant” and, collectively, the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to our Sponsor (the “Private Placement”), generating gross proceeds of $6,600,000.



Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, an amount of $230,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and certain of the proceeds of the Private Placement were placed in a Trust Account (the “Trust Account”) with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by us, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to our stockholders, as described below.



Our management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) rules provide that the Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the Trust Account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time we sign a definitive agreement to enter a Business Combination. We will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.

We intend to effectuate a Business Combination using the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and Private Placement, and from additional issuances of, if any, our capital stock and our debt, or a combination of cash, stock and debt. We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any operating revenues to date. Our only activities from inception through December 31, 2021 were organizational activities and those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial Business Combination. Based on our business activities, we are a “shell company” as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.



We will provide our holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the “public stockholders”) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion. The public stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be $10.00 per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our tax obligations). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to our warrants.



We have until January 11, 2023 to complete a Business Combination or any extended period of time that we have to consummate a Business Combination as a result of an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Combination Period”). If we are unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our tax obligations (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period.



Effecting a Business Combination



Our Business Strategy



Over the past few years, the level of celebrity involvement in companies has evolved significantly. Historically, companies paid celebrities to be the spokesperson or endorser for the brand, simply promoting the products via advertisements with limited monetary investment in or time dedicated to the mission of the brand. Increasingly, celebrities have been establishing their own brands or investing heavily in companies where their dedication, massive reach and positive customer impact have helped accelerate growth. Where legacy paid endorsement lacks in an authentic connection with the brand or product, ownership signals a permanent association, passion and focus by the celebrity. A celebrity’s impact on business performance is multi-dimensional, ranging from expanding its marketing exposure, generating greater salesforce motivation, or securing executive talent.



Many companies have reaped the benefits from celebrity involvement. Recent examples in the public market include Weight Watchers (NasdaqGS: WW) with Oprah Winfrey and Papa John’s (NasdaqGS: PZZA) with Shaquille O’Neal. In the three years following Ms. Winfrey joining the Board of Directors and acquiring her initial stake in the business in 2015 for approximately $40 million, Weight Watchers saw over a 350% appreciation in the value of its stock. Ms. Winfrey was instrumental in redefining the image and mission of Weight Watchers from being a diet company to a health and wellness brand. Similarly, Papa John’s saw over 70% stock appreciation from the time Mr. O’Neal was appointed to the Board of Directors and became an investor in nine Atlanta franchises in March 2019 through December 8, 2020. Other notable celebrity investors or brand founders include Ryan Reynolds’ Aviation Gin (sold alongside Davos Brands to Diageo, the world’s largest producer of spirits and beers, for $610 million in 2020), George Clooney’s Casamigos (sold to Diageo for $1 billion in 2018), Jessica Alba’s Honest Company (a portfolio company of L. Catterton since their $200 million investment in 2018), Dr. Dre’s Beats (sold to Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL) for $3 billion in 2014), and Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop (received Series C funding in 2018 at an implied valuation of $250 million). Except for the investment in Ryan Reynolds’ Aviation Gin by Messrs. Shapiro, Howard and Mahan, and Mark Shapiro’s role as a director at the time of Papa John’s involvement with Shaquille O’Neal, none of the Company, our Sponsor or our directors or officers had any involvement with the other companies described or their respective celebrity investors. Additionally, past performance by our management team and their respective affiliates, and by companies affiliated with celebrities, may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us or in the future performance of any business that we may acquire.

Having access to the right celebrity partners can be an enormous advantage to a brand. A celebrity can drive awareness and marketing, particularly through the authentic and frequent use of her/his/their social media platforms. Through decades of operating experience with significant media and talent exposure, our executive team has built a robust network of celebrity and industry executive relationships. By utilizing this network, our team has a track record of originating and executing strategic placement of celebrity partners, including involving Ryan Reynolds in their investment in Aviation Gin. We believe our executive team’s experience will provide us with the ability to source transactions and identify companies that can be attractive public companies. We believe our executive team’s experience will be a significant benefit to us in evaluating potential initial Business Combination candidates and make us the preferred partner for target companies in completing an initial Business Combination. Over the course of their respective careers, each member of our executive team has developed an extensive network of celebrity contacts and corporate relationships which we believe will provide us with a robust source of acquisition opportunities.



We believe our executive team and board of directors’ experience and relationships will provide us with the ability to source transactions and identify companies that can be attractive public companies. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team, our board of directors and their affiliates have developed a broad network of contacts, corporate relationships and celebrity relationships that we believe will serve as a differentiated source of acquisition opportunities and competitive strength. This network has been developed through our:




● | Extensive experience in sourcing, structuring, acquiring, operating, integrating, developing, growing, financing and selling businesses; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Significant experience in both investing in and operating across a range of sectors, setting and changing strategies, and identifying, monitoring and recruiting world-class talent and becoming a trusted partner to celebrities in connection with their business activities; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Deep relationships with sellers, financing providers and target management teams; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Experience negotiating transactions favorable to investors; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Experience in executing transactions in a broad range of sectors under varying economic and financial market conditions. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We expect our differentiated global networks will provide us with a robust flow of acquisition opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, which may include investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms, large business enterprises, celebrities, artist representatives, entrepreneurs and executives.



Business Combination Criteria



When target companies are being evaluated, we expect to use the following, non-exclusive criteria for determining opportunities:




● | Size: We intend to target entities whose enterprise value is between $500 million and $1.5 billion. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Platform to Partner with Celebrities as a Catalyst to Create Value: We intend to seek businesses or assets in which our management and board of directors can access their extensive network and partner with the right celebrity to help drive brand monetization and accelerate growth. We may also seek businesses or assets in which are already celebrity-owned and looking for a path to public liquidity. We believe direct celebrity involvement provides brands with a value of association and authenticity that drives stronger consumer connection and can help accelerate its existing growth potential. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Scalable Platform with Established Brand or Franchise: We intend to identify targets with an associated reputable brand that can be enhanced by a celebrity’s extensive consumer reach and access to superior operational talent. These businesses have the infrastructure in place to become a public entity and will benefit from our management’s and board of directors’ operating experience in order to scale the business. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Underlying Intellectual Property (“IP”): We intend to focus on businesses that have underlying IP that can be used to further monetize the brand or allow for exploration of adjacent verticals or product extensions. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Opportunities for Expansion and Operational Enhancements: We intend to seek assets with the ability to drive growth through organic opportunities and accretive acquisitions post-closing of the Business Combination. We intend to identify targets where additional capital investment and effective sponsorship will result in improvements in operational and/or financial performance. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Attractive Valuations: We intend to focus on companies that are attractively valued relative to public comparable companies. We anticipate establishing a focus on targets that can be acquired at reasonable valuations with opportunity for significant near-term value creation through accelerated growth, incremental profitability and overall impact from celebrity. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial Business Combination may be based on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into a Business Combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that fact in our stockholder communications related to our initial Business Combination, which would be in the form of proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we would file with the SEC.



Additional Disclosures



Our Acquisition Process



Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a Business Combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a Business Combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such Business Combination opportunity to such other entity. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to identify and pursue Business Combination opportunities or complete our initial Business Combination.



In addition, our Sponsor and our officers and directors may sponsor or form other special purpose acquisition companies similar to ours or may pursue other business or investment ventures during the period in which we are seeking an initial Business Combination. Any such companies, businesses or investments may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an initial Business Combination. However, we do not believe that any such potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to identify and pursue Business Combination opportunities or complete our initial Business Combination.



Initial Business Combination



Nasdaq listing rules require that our initial Business Combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account). Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. We refer to this as the 80% fair market value test. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial Business Combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq listing rules, any initial Business Combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors.

We anticipate structuring our initial Business Combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial Business Combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the Business Combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial Business Combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial Business Combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the 80% of fair market value test described above. If the Business Combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.



Competition



We expect to encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other special purpose acquisition companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting Business Combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Additionally, the number of blank check companies looking for Business Combination targets has increased compared to recent years and many of these blank check companies are sponsored by entities or persons that have significant experience with completing Business Combinations. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds from our Initial Public Offering and Private Placement, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who properly exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial Business Combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. These factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating and completing an initial Business Combination.
Human Capital Management



We currently have two executive officers and do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial Business Combination. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial Business Combination. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial Business Combination and the current stage of the Business Combination process.
