ITEM 1. BUSINESS
INTRODUCTION
Willis Lease Finance Corporation with its subsidiaries (“WLFC” or the “Company”) is a leading lessor and servicer of commercial aircraft and aircraft engines. Our principal business objective is to build value for our shareholders by acquiring commercial aircraft and engines and managing those assets in order to provide a return on investment, primarily through lease rent and maintenance reserve revenues, as well as through management fees earned for managing assets owned by other parties. As of December 31, 2020, our $1,886.6 million equipment held for operating lease portfolio and $158.7 million notes receivable represented 291 engines, eight aircraft, one marine vessel and other leased parts and equipment with 70 lessees in 41 countries. In addition to our owned portfolio, as of December 31, 2020, we managed a total lease portfolio of 400 engines, aircraft and related equipment for other parties.
Willis Aeronautical Services, Inc. (“Willis Aero”) is a wholly owned subsidiary whose primary focus is the sale of aircraft engine parts and materials through the acquisition or consignment of aircraft and engines. 
Willis Asset Management Limited (“Willis Asset Management”) is a wholly owned subsidiary whose primary focus is the engine management and consulting business. Willis Asset Management had 362 engines, excluding WLFC engines, under management as of December 31, 2020.
We are a Delaware corporation, incorporated in 1998. Our executive offices are located at 4700 Lyons Technology Parkway, Coconut Creek, Florida 33073. We transact business directly and through our subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities (“VIE”) unless otherwise indicated.
We maintain a website at www.willislease.com where our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports are available without charge, as soon as reasonably practicable following the time they are filed with or furnished to the SEC. The SEC also maintains an electronic Internet site that contains our reports, proxies and information statements, and other information that we file or furnish at http://www.sec.gov.
We separate our business into two reportable segments, Leasing and Related Operations and Spare Parts Sales. Our business activities by reportable segment are described below.
Leasing and Related Operations
Our strategy is to lease aircraft and aircraft engines and provide related services to a diversified group of commercial aircraft operators and maintenance, repair and overhaul organizations (“MROs”) worldwide. Commercial aircraft operators need engines in addition to those installed on the aircraft that they operate. These spare engines are required for various reasons, including requirements that engines be inspected and repaired at regular intervals based on equipment utilization. Furthermore, unscheduled events such as mechanical failure, Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) airworthiness directives or manufacturer-recommended actions for maintenance, repair and overhaul of engines result in the need for spare engines. Commercial aircraft operators and others in the industry generally estimate that the total number of spare engines needed is around 12% of the total number of installed engines. Industry research suggests that there are nearly 52,000 engines installed on commercial aircraft. Accordingly, it is estimated that there are 6,200 spare engines in the market, including both owned and leased spare engines.
Our engine portfolio primarily consists of noise-compliant Stage IV commercial jet engines manufactured by CFMI, General Electric, Pratt & Whitney, Rolls Royce and International Aero Engines. These engines generally may be used on one or more aircraft types and are the most widely used engines in the world, powering Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier and Embraer aircraft.
The Company acquires engines for its leasing portfolio in a number of ways. It enters into sale and lease back transactions with operators of aircraft, original equipment manufacturers of engines and providers of engine maintenance cost per hour services. We also purchase both new and used engines that are subject to a lease when purchased and on a speculative basis (i.e. without a lease attached from manufacturers or other parties which own such engines).
Total revenues from our Leasing and Related Operations reportable segment was 94.1% and 86.3% of the respective total consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
At December 31, 2020, approximately 75% of our on-lease engines, aircraft, and related equipment (all of which we sometimes refer to as “equipment”) by net book value are leased and operated internationally. Substantially all leases relating to this equipment are denominated and payable in U.S. dollars, which is customary in the industry. Future leases may provide for payments to be made in euros or other foreign currencies. In 2020, we leased our equipment to lessees domiciled in eight geographic regions. 
Spare Parts Sales
Our wholly owned subsidiary Willis Aero primarily engages in the sale of aircraft engine parts and materials through the acquisition or consignment of engines from third parties or from the leasing portfolio. This business segment enables our Company to provide end-of-life solutions for the growing supply of surplus aircraft and engines, as well as manage the full lifecycle of our lease assets, enhance the returns on our engine portfolio and create incremental value for our shareholders.
COVID-19 Impact 
The worldwide spread of the COVID-19 virus has resulted in a global slowdown of economic activity. While the duration and extent of the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, it has had an adverse effect on the global economy and the ultimate societal and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic remains unknown. In particular, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions to the airline industry that has resulted in a dramatic reduction in demand for air travel domestically and abroad, which is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. Throughout the next year, we plan to continue to stay focused on cost control and remain prudent with our capital expenditures. In addition to the impacts described below, dramatically lower demand for air travel in turn presents significant risks to our Company, not all of which we are able to fully evaluate or even to foresee at the current time, and could negatively impact collections of accounts receivable, cause our lessee customers to not enter into new leases, reduce spending from new and existing customers for leases or spare parts or equipment, lower usage fees, cause some of our customers to go out of business, and limit the ability of our personnel to travel to customers and potential customers, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we experienced declining average utilization and a corresponding decrease in revenue, as well as a significant decline in spare parts and equipment sales, in each case as compared to the prior year periods. Additionally, we have, in certain situations, agreed to rent concessions which resulted in a total reduction to rent revenues of $6.5 million during 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has materially affected our business and financial results for the year ended December 31, 2020, and may continue to do so indefinitely thereafter. We have temporarily closed our headquarters and other offices, required our employees and contractors to predominately work remotely, and implemented travel restrictions, all of which represent a significant disruption in how we operate our business. We have taken various proactive actions in an attempt to mitigate the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, during 2020, 9% of our employees have been either furloughed, or subject to a form of reduced compensation. The operations of our partners and customers have likewise been disrupted. 
The scope and nature of the impact of COVID-19 on the airline industry, and in turn our business, continue to evolve and the outcomes are uncertain. Given the uncertainty in the rapidly changing market and economic conditions related to COVID-19, we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business and financial position. The ultimate extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our Company will depend on future developments, and such effects could exist for an extended period of time.
INDUSTRY BACKGROUND - THE DEMAND FOR LEASED AIRCRAFT ENGINES
Historically, commercial aircraft operators owned rather than leased their spare engines. As engines become more powerful and technically sophisticated, they also become more expensive to acquire and maintain. In part due to cash constraints on commercial aircraft operators and the costs associated with engine ownership, commercial aircraft operators have become more cost-conscious and now utilize operating leases for a portion of their spare engines and are therefore better able to manage their finances in this capital-intensive business. Engine leasing is a specialized business that has evolved into a discrete sector of the commercial aviation market. Participants in this sector need access to capital, as well as specialized technical knowledge, in order to compete successfully.
Growth in the spare engine leasing industry is dependent on two fundamental drivers:
•the number of commercial aircraft, and therefore engines, in the market; and
•the proportion of engines that are leased, rather than owned, by commercial aircraft operators.
While COVID-19 has significantly impacted engine leasing, we still believe leasing will increase over time but more slowly.
Increased number of aircraft, and therefore engines, in the market
We believe that the number of commercial and cargo aircraft, and hence spare engines, will increase. Boeing projects 3.2% annual growth in the global commercial jet fleet, increasing the current fleet to over 48,400 aircraft by 2039. Aircraft equipment manufacturers have predicted such an increase in aircraft to address the rapid growth of both passenger and cargo traffic in the Asian markets, as well as demand for new aircraft in more mature markets. While we believe these predictions are accurate over the long term, COVID-19 has materially disrupted the airline industry and significantly slowed down passenger growth globally, including in 
the U.S., and we believe such growth and demand may be negatively impacted over the short to medium term. See “Risk Factors” below.
Increased lease penetration rate
Spare engines provide support for installed engines in the event of routine or other engine maintenance or unscheduled removal. The number of spare engines needed to service any fleet is determined by many factors. These factors include:
•the number and type of aircraft in an aircraft operator’s fleet;
•the geographic scope of such aircraft operator’s destinations;
•the time an engine is on-wing between removals;
•average shop visit time; and
•the number of spare engines an aircraft operator requires in order to ensure coverage for predicted and unscheduled removals.
We believe that commercial aircraft operators are increasingly considering their spare engines as significant capital assets, where operating leases may be more attractive than finance leases or ownership of spare engines. We believe that currently 35% of the spare engine market falls under the category of leased engines. Industry analysts have forecast that the percentage of leased engines is likely to increase over the next 15 years as engine leasing follows the growth of aircraft leasing. We believe this is due to the increasing cost of newer engines, the anticipated modernization of the worldwide aircraft fleet and the significant cost associated therewith, and the emergence of new niche-focused airlines which generally use leasing in order to obtain their capital assets.
ENGINE LEASING
As of December 31, 2020, the majority of our leases to air carriers, manufacturers and MROs were operating leases with the exception of certain failed sale-leaseback transactions classified as notes receivable under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842. Under operating leases, we retain the potential benefit and assume the risk of the residual value of the equipment, in contrast to finance leases where the lessee has more of the potential benefits and risks of ownership. Operating leases allow commercial aircraft operators greater fleet and financial flexibility due to the relatively small initial capital outlay necessary to obtain use of the aircraft equipment, and the availability of short- and long-term leases to better meet their needs. Operating lease rates are generally higher than finance lease rates, in part because of the lessor retained residual value risk.
We describe all of our current leases as “triple-net” operating leases. A triple-net operating lease requires the lessee to make the full lease payment and pay any other expenses associated with the use of the engines, such as maintenance, casualty and liability insurance, sales or use taxes and personal property taxes. The leases contain detailed provisions specifying the lessees’ responsibility for engine damage, maintenance standards and the required condition of the engine upon return at the end of the lease. During the term of the lease, we require the lessee to maintain the engine in accordance with an approved maintenance program designed to meet applicable regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which the lessee operates.
We enter into both long-term and short-term leases which typically provide for monthly payment. Long-term leases typically have original lease terms in excess of one year. Characteristics of a long-term lease also include specified return conditions. Return conditions can be met by the customer through a maintenance overhaul in advance of asset return or a cash settlement at lease end resulting in maintenance revenue at that time. Maintenance reserves are often used for payment of maintenance overhauls in advance of asset returns. The cash settlement may, in some instances, be taken from maintenance reserves paid throughout the course of the lease. Short-term leases typically have an original lease term of less than one year. Short-term leases also include non-refundable, usage-based maintenance fees, which are billed at contractual rates and recognized as revenue over the term of the leases. Payment terms of our leases are predominately monthly in advance for rent and in arrears for usage. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, 28% and 40%, respectively, of the Company’s leases by net book value were short-term leases.
We try to mitigate risk where possible. For example, we make an analysis of the credit risk associated with the lessee before entering into any significant lease transaction. Our credit analysis generally consists of evaluating the prospective lessee’s financial standing by utilizing financial statements and trade and/or banking references. In certain circumstances, we may require our lessees to provide additional credit support, such as a letter of credit or a guaranty from a bank or a third party or a security deposit. We also evaluate insurance and expropriation risk and evaluate and monitor the political and legal climate of the country in which a particular lessee is located in order to determine our ability to repossess our engines should the need arise. Despite these guidelines, we cannot give assurance that we will not experience collection problems or significant losses in the future. See “Risk Factors” below.
At the commencement of a lease, we may collect, in advance, a security deposit normally equal to at least one month’s lease payment. The security deposit is returned to the lessee after all lease return conditions have been met. Under the terms of some of our 
leases, during the term of the lease, the lessee pays amounts to us based on usage of the engine, which is referred to as maintenance reserves or use fees, which are designed to cover the expected future maintenance costs. For those leases in which the maintenance reserves are reimbursable to the lessee, maintenance reserves are collected and are reimbursed to the lessee when qualifying maintenance is performed. Under longer-term leases, to the extent that cumulative use fee billings are inadequate to fund expenditures required prior to return of the engine to us, the lessee is obligated to cover the shortfall.
During the lease period, our leases require that maintenance and inspection of the leased engines be performed at qualified maintenance facilities certified by the FAA or its foreign equivalent. In addition, when an engine becomes off-lease, it undergoes inspection to verify compliance with lease return conditions. Our management believes that our attention to our lessees and our emphasis on maintenance and inspection helps preserve residual values and generally helps us to recover our investment in our leased engines.
Upon termination of a lease, we will either enter into a new lease, sell or part out the related engines or airframe. The demand for aftermarket engines for either sale or lease may be affected by a number of variables, including:
•general market conditions;
•regulatory changes (particularly those imposing environmental, maintenance and other requirements on the operation of engines);
•changes in demand for air travel;
•fuel costs;
•changes in the supply and cost of aircraft equipment; and
•technological developments.
The value of a particular used engine or airframe varies greatly depending upon its condition, the maintenance services performed during the lease term and, as applicable, the number of hours or cycles remaining until the next major maintenance interval. If we are unable to lease or sell engines on favorable terms, our financial results and our ability to service debt may be adversely affected. See “Risk Factors” below.
The value of a particular model of engine is heavily dependent on the status of the types of aircraft on which it is installed. We believe values of engines tend to be stable as long as the host aircraft for the engines and the engines themselves are still being manufactured. Prices will also tend to remain stable and even rise after a host aircraft is no longer manufactured as long as there is sufficient demand for the host aircraft. However, the value of an engine begins to decline rapidly once the host aircraft is retired from service and/or parted out in significant numbers. Values of engines also may decline because of manufacturing defects that may surface subsequently.
As of December 31, 2020, our $1,886.6 million equipment held for operating lease portfolio and $158.7 million notes receivable represented 291 engines, eight aircraft, one marine vessel and other leased parts and equipment. As of December 31, 2019, our $1,650.9 million equipment held for operating lease portfolio and $38.1 million notes receivable represented 263 engines, 12 aircraft, one marine vessel and other leased parts and equipment.
As of December 31, 2020 minimum future rentals under non-cancelable operating leases of these engines, related equipment and aircraft assets were as follows:

Year | (in thousands)
2021 | $ | 120,393
2022 | 75,835 | 
2023 | 28,452 | 
2024 | 15,091 | 
2025 | 5,647 | 
Thereafter | 8,002 | 
 | $ | 253,420

As of December 31, 2020, we had 70 lessees of commercial aircraft engines and related equipment, aircraft, and other leased parts and equipment in 41 countries. We believe the loss of any one customer would not have a significant long-term adverse effect on our business. We operate in a global market in which our engines are easily transferable among lessees located in many countries, which 
stabilizes demand and allows us to recover from the loss of a particular customer. As a result, we do not believe we are dependent on a single customer or a few customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our revenues.
In 2011 we entered into an agreement with Mitsui & Co., Ltd. to participate in a joint venture formed as a Dublin-based Irish limited company — Willis Mitsui & Company Engine Support Limited (“WMES”) for the purpose of acquiring and leasing jet engines. Each partner holds a fifty percent interest in the joint venture. WMES owned a lease portfolio, inclusive of a note receivable, of 36 engines and five aircraft with a net book value of $289.2 million as of December 31, 2020. Our investment in the joint venture was $37.4 million as of December 31, 2020.
In 2014 we entered into an agreement with China Aviation Supplies Import & Export Corporation (“CASC”) to participate in a joint venture named CASC Willis Lease Finance Company Limited (“CASC Willis”), a new joint venture based in Shanghai, China. Each partner holds a fifty percent interest in the joint venture. CASC Willis acquires and leases jet engines to Chinese airlines and concentrates on meeting the fast-growing demand for leased commercial aircraft engines and aviation assets in the People’s Republic of China. CASC Willis owned a lease portfolio of four engines with a net book value of $50.1 million as of December 31, 2020. Our investment in the joint venture was $15.9 million as of December 31, 2020. 
AIRCRAFT LEASING
As of December 31, 2020, our operating lease portfolio and notes receivable included two Boeing 737 aircraft, five A319-111 aircraft, and one A321-200 aircraft with an aggregate net book value of $105.2 million.
Our aircraft leases are “triple-net” leases and the lessee is responsible for making the full lease payment and paying any other expenses associated with the use of the aircraft, such as maintenance, casualty and liability insurance, sales or use taxes and personal property taxes. In addition, the lessee is responsible for normal maintenance and repairs, engine and airframe overhauls, and compliance with return conditions of flight equipment on lease. Under the provisions of many leases, for certain engine and airframe overhauls, we reimburse the lessee for costs incurred up to but not exceeding maintenance reserves the lessee has paid to us. Maintenance reserves are designed to cover the expected maintenance costs. The lessee is also responsible for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations with respect to the aircraft. We require our lessees to comply with FAA requirements. We periodically inspect our leased aircraft. Generally, we require a deposit as security for the lessee’s performance of obligations under the lease and the condition of the aircraft upon return. In addition, the leases contain extensive provisions regarding our remedies and rights in the event of a default by the lessee and specific provisions regarding the condition of the aircraft upon return. The lessee is required to continue to make lease payments under all circumstances, including periods during which the aircraft is not in operation due to maintenance or grounding.
SPARE PARTS SALES
The sale of spare parts is managed by the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Willis Aero. Willis Aero primarily engages in the sale of aircraft engine parts and materials through the acquisition or consignment from third parties or from the leasing portfolio. This business segment enables our Company to provide end-of-life solutions for the growing supply of surplus aircraft and engines, as well as manage the full lifecycle of our lease assets, enhance the returns on our engine portfolio and create incremental value for our shareholders.  As of December 31, 2020, spare parts inventory had a carrying value of $59.4 million.
ASSET MANAGEMENT
Willis Asset Management is a wholly owned subsidiary whose primary focus is the engine management and consulting business. Willis Asset Management had 362 engines, excluding WLFC engines, under management as of December 31, 2020. 
COMPETITION
The markets for our products and services are very competitive, and we face competition from a number of sources. These competitors include aircraft engine and aircraft parts manufacturers, aircraft and aircraft engine lessors, airline and aircraft service and repair companies and aircraft and aircraft engine spare parts distributors. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than us. Those resources may include greater name recognition, larger product lines, complementary lines of business, greater financial, marketing, information systems and other resources. In addition, equipment manufacturers, aircraft maintenance providers, FAA certified repair facilities and other aviation aftermarket suppliers may vertically integrate into the markets that we serve, thereby significantly increasing industry competition and negatively impacting the Company. We can give no assurance that competitive pressures will not materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We compete primarily with aircraft engine manufacturers as well as with other aircraft engine lessors. It is common for commercial aircraft operators and MROs to utilize several leasing companies to meet their aircraft engine needs and to minimize reliance on a single leasing company.
Our competitors compete with us in many ways, including pricing, technical expertise, lease flexibility, engine availability, supply reliability, customer service and the quality and condition of engines. Many of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do, or are affiliates of larger companies. We emphasize the quality of our portfolio of aircraft engines, supply reliability and high level of customer service to our aircraft equipment lessees. We focus on ensuring adequate aircraft engine availability in high-demand locations, dedicate large portions of our organization to building relationships with lessees, maintain close day-to-day coordination with lessees and have developed an engine pooling arrangement that allows pool members quick access to available spare aircraft engines.
INSURANCE
In addition to requiring full indemnification under the terms of our leases, we require our lessees to carry the types of insurance customary in the air transportation industry, including comprehensive third-party liability insurance and physical damage and casualty insurance. We require that we be named as an additional insured on liability insurance with ourselves and our lenders normally identified as the loss payee for damage to the equipment on policies carried by lessees. We monitor compliance with the insurance provisions of the leases. We also carry contingent physical damage and third-party liability insurance as well as product liability insurance.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
Our customers are subject to a high degree of regulation in the jurisdictions in which they operate. For example, the FAA regulates the manufacture, repair and operation of all aircraft operated in the United States and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries, such as the European Aviation Safety Agency (“EASA”) in Europe, regulate aircraft operated in those countries. Such regulations also indirectly affect our business operations. All aircraft operated in the United States must be maintained under a continuous condition-monitoring program and must periodically undergo thorough inspection and maintenance. The inspection, maintenance and repair procedures for commercial aircraft are prescribed by regulatory authorities and can be performed only by certified repair facilities utilizing certified technicians. The FAA can suspend or revoke the authority of air carriers or their licensed personnel for failure to comply with regulations and ground aircraft if their airworthiness is in question.
While our leasing and reselling business is not regulated, the aircraft, engines and related parts that we purchase, lease and sell must be accompanied by documentation that enables the customer to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. Furthermore, before parts may be installed in an aircraft, they must meet certain standards of condition established by the FAA and/or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied by compliance with FAA requirements. With respect to a particular engine or engine component, we utilize FAA and/or EASA certified repair stations to repair and certify engines and components to ensure marketability.
Governmental regulations where the related airframe is registered, and where the aircraft is operated, stipulate noise and emissions levels restrictions. For example, jurisdictions throughout the world have adopted noise regulations which require all aircraft to comply with Stage III noise requirements. In addition to the current Stage III compliance requirements, the United States and the International Civil Aviation Organization, or “ICAO,” have adopted a more stringent set of “Stage IV” standards for noise levels which apply to engines manufactured or certified from 2006 onward. At this time, the United States regulations do not require any phase-out of aircraft that qualify only for Stage III compliance, but the European Union has established a framework for the imposition of operating limitations on non-Stage IV aircraft.
As of December 31, 2020, most of the engines in our lease portfolio are Stage IV engines and are generally suitable for use on one or more commonly used aircraft.
We believe that the aviation industry will be subject to continued regulatory activity. Additionally, increased oversight will continue to originate from the quality assurance departments of airline operators. We have been able to meet all such requirements to date, and believe that we will be able to meet any additional requirements that may be imposed. We cannot give assurance, however, that new, more stringent government regulations will not be adopted in the future or that any such new regulations, if enacted, would not have a material adverse impact on us.
FINANCING/SOURCE OF FUNDS
We, directly or through our Willis Engine Structured Trust III, IV, and V (“WEST III”, “WEST IV” and “WEST V”) asset-backed securitizations (“ABS”) typically acquire engines with a combination of equity capital and funds borrowed from financial institutions. In order to facilitate financing and leasing of engines, each engine is generally owned through a statutory or common law trust that is wholly owned by us or our subsidiaries. We usually borrow up to 85% of an engine purchase price. Substantially all of our assets secure our related indebtedness. We typically acquire engines from airlines, engine manufacturers or from other lessors. From time to time, we selectively acquire engines prior to a firm commitment to lease or sell the engine, depending on the price of the 
engine and market demand with the expectation that we can lease or sell such engines in the future. Additionally, for discrete financing purposes, we will enter into bi-lateral and preferred financing arrangements from time to time.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2020, we had 232 total employees, of which 217 are full-time employees (excluding consultants), in sales and marketing, technical service and administration. During 2020, 9% of our employees have been either furloughed, or subject to a form of reduced compensation. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we believe our employee relations are satisfactory.
