ITEM 1. | Business
--------+---------


GreenLight has a clear mission: To create products addressing some of humanity’s greatest challenges through the rigorous application of science. 
 We aim to achieve this goal through our cell-free biomanufacturing platform. This platform enables us to make complex biological molecules—nucleic acids, peptides, carbohydrates, and many others—in a manner that we believe will allow us to manufacture high-quality products at a lower cost than traditional methods using fermentation. We are using this platform to develop and commercialize products that, if they receive appropriate regulatory approvals, address agricultural, human health and animal health issues. 
 Humanity faces numerous challenges. There are more than seven and a half billion people sharing the diminishing resources of Earth. This growing population needs to produce more food with the same amount of land and, at the same time, honor the global desire—and increasing technical need—to replace chemical pesticides. Not only are these pesticides facing increased consumer opposition and threat of outright bans due to environmental damage, many are losing their effectiveness. 
 More than half the world’s population now lives in cities, breathing the same air that carries pathogens and causes infections. Humanity needs to adapt and tackle pandemics both for those who have and for those who do not have access to good health care around the planet. 
 To address these issues, we need to develop high-quality, cost-effective products that can be deployed widely, including to developing countries. We believe RNA can be the critical aspect to these products. 
 Ribonucleic acid, or RNA, recently gained broad global prominence as the COVID-19 pandemic swept through the world’s population, prompting messenger RNA, or mRNA, vaccines to move from a scientific theory to a medical reality. Vaccines made using mRNA proved among the fastest to develop and the easiest to update for newer strains of COVID-19.
While the fast rollout of mRNA vaccines helped change the course of the pandemic, this is just one part of the story. The full potential for RNA in human health has not yet been been realized. Beyond human health, RNA-based technology can also be deployed to address other global issues, including agricultural needs for crop protection. 
 Our technology platform, which was initially developed to produce agricultural crop protection products and is protected by patents and know-how, is capable of synthesizing building blocks (nucleotides), building tools (enzymes), and instructions (DNA templates) to make dsRNA within an integrated process. The manufacturing process know-how that we gained from our experience making dsRNA allows us to understand some of the key aspects of producing mRNAs. For more information on our manufacturing platform and technology, see “Item 1. Business – Our Manufacturing Platform.”
We have several dsRNA-based products in our agricultural pipeline that, if commercialized, we believe can change the way in which farmers protect crops, allowing them to better utilize the land dedicated to agriculture and produce foods with less or no pesticide residue. One of these products, Calantha which is designed to manage Colorado potato beetles, has been submitted to the EPA for approval. Our other dsRNA-based agricultural products are in various earlier stages of development as compared to Calantha, our Colorado potato beetle product, ranging from proof of concept in the lab to proof of technology in the greenhouse and proof of scale in the field. See “Item 1. Business — Plant Health Product Pipeline — Process for developing new products” for additional information on the development process. In order to commercialize a product for the U.S. agricultural market, we must complete specified toxicology studies, submit a registration dossier to the EPA

  demonstrating that the product does not pose unreasonable risks to human health or the environment, respond adequately to any deficiencies identified by the EPA through its risk assessment process and obtain the EPA’s approval of our labeling. The EPA must also establish a tolerance level for the product or issue a tolerance exemption. We must separately obtain any applicable state or foreign regulatory approvals. For more information regarding the regulatory process, “Item 1. Business – Government Regulation – Agricultural Products” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Plant Health Program”. 
 We are also in pre-clinical development of RNA-based vaccines directed at arresting the damage of the current viral pandemic and addressing emerging pathogens. The first candidate in this product pipeline that we hope to bring to market is a COVID-19 vaccine, which is currently being tested on animals in toxicity studies in anticipation of filing a Clinical Trials Application, or CTA, with the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority, or SAHPRA, which, if approved, will allow clinical testing on human subjects. Depending on the results of any clinical testing in South Africa, we may decide to file an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application with the FDA for additional testing of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate. Other product candidates in the human health pipeline have yet to reach the Pre-IND phase. To get to the Pre-IND phase for our other product candidates in our human health pipeline, we must successfully design and test the product candidates in animal models, achieve positive results, select the product candidates to progress to IND-enabling toxicology studies, develop chemistry, manufacturing, and controls protocols and create a development plan to discuss with the FDA as part of pre-IND consultations. 
 AN INTRODUCTION TO RNA 
 RNA is present in all known life forms and plays an essential role in numerous biological processes but primarily provides a template by which proteins are constructed. In some organisms RNA can be the mechanism by which those templates are stored, but, in higher forms of life, it translates the code stored in the form of DNA and provides the template to convert that code into proteins by transcribing the DNA. Consequently, RNA molecules are being studied as potential products in many fields, such as agriculture (for pest control), animal health, and human health (messenger RNA-based vaccines and gene therapies). 
 RNA can be transformative for human health and plant health: 
 

• | Human and animal health—where messenger RNA, or mRNA, can be used to express proteins which form the basis of vaccines as well as other therapies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Plant health—where dsRNA can be leveraged to regulate the expression of a target protein by interfering with its message. Such RNA-mediated interference can form the basis for highly targeted pesticides or protection against parasites.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


RNA in agriculture 
 New crop-protection strategies are urgently needed as pests become resistant to existing pesticide products. Many existing products are also being limited through primary regulatory action (government regulations) or secondary regulations (food chain regulation) because of concerns about their effects on humans or the environment, with environmental concerns including off-target toxicity and long-term effects on crops, soil, and water. Together, these factors spur the need to develop alternative crop-protection products with new modes of action and improved safety profiles. 
 Double-stranded RNA products in agriculture exploit a natural biological process called RNA interference (RNAi). This a biological process found in many eukaryotic organisms, which break down dsRNA that has been taken into a cell into short fragments known as either micro-RNA or small interfering RNA (siRNA). The presence of these small RNA fragments can lead to the degradation of the corresponding mRNA, thereby limiting or stopping the synthesis of protein specific to a particular harmful pest insect. 
 
2 

  RNA-based pesticides may be able to give us more environmentally friendly ways to protect crops and beneficial insects while effectively stopping harmful pests. Much of our ability to design products that are intended to improve the environmental profile associated with crop protection products relies on our ability to design an RNA sequence that is only found in the organism(s) that we desire to manage. In this design process, we will compare the genome of our target species to the genome of other species that may co-exist with it, including humans. The goal is to have no overlap with the genome of other organisms by which our products would harm those organisms. 
 RNA in human health 
 Messenger RNA’s features make it broadly valuable for human health. It is well known that mRNA has been used to make some of the most effective COVID-19 vaccines and that these vaccines have been developed quickly, which is critical for a pandemic response. More than one billion doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine have been produced. However, beyond COVID-19 vaccines, mRNA’s features make it valuable for other vaccines and therapies. We are working on using mRNA in multiple vaccines and therapeutic applications such as an influenza vaccine, a sickle cell gene therapy and a shingles vaccine. 
 DNA encodes the instructions for life to function. DNA is transcribed into mRNA in the cellular nucleus, and subsequently this mRNA is translated into proteins in the cellular cytoplasm. Instructions to make proteins that help perform many critical functions are transcribed from the DNA to mRNA. The mRNA consists of four ribonucleosides (Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, and Uracil), the sequence of which determines the structure of the proteins encoded. Synthetic mRNA can be produced in manufacturing facilities for delivery into the cellular cytoplasm, enabling the cells to produce proteins as vaccines or for therapy. 
 mRNA has many advantages: 
 

• | Wide range of applications: mRNA can produce any encoded protein (intracellular, membrane-bound, or secreted), giving it many uses in vaccines, gene therapy, or for therapeutic proteins.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Transient expression: The body has mechanisms to degrade mRNA, allowing for repeat dosing and a dose response which can be tailored for the needs of the pharmaceutical product.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fast development: Relatively simple changes to the mRNA molecule are needed to produce different therapeutic proteins, enabling a fast turnaround from gene selection to product with little need for manufacturing changes. For instance, if a booster vaccine is needed for a new variant, no changes will need to be made except to the mRNA sequence itself.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Flexible manufacturing: A single manufacturing facility can produce different vaccines and therapies, as the process is essentially the same regardless of the product.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Until recently, it was very difficult to stabilize mRNA, understand its interaction with the human immune system, or deliver it in vivo. Addressing these challenges has allowed the development of the RNA industry and its rapid deployment as a global healthcare product. 
 THE IMPACT OF OUR HIGH-QUALITY, LOW-COST RNA
We currently make multiple forms of dsRNA at a rate of 2,000 liters per batch using our cell-free manufacturing platform. We have increased our production rate from microliters to milliliters to liters to our current 2,000-liter capacity with no material impact on quality or process yields. We believe our expertise and proprietary technology will allow us to increase batch sizes to 10,000 liters and beyond, which will allow us to reduce the per-liter cost of our dsRNA products.

  Alternative RNA production methods are generally slow to develop and more expensive: 
 

• | Cell-based fermentation does not achieve the quality required for human health uses or the cost considerations for broadacre coverage in agriculture applications.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Conventional cell-free processes, such as in vitro transcription (IVT), are cost prohibitive for agricultural applications and require complex specialty input supply chains.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


GreenLight’s manufacturing platform uses: 
 

• | a proprietary cell-free methodology that enables production at less than $1/gram for the production of technical grade active ingredient dsRNA.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a flexible architecture that accommodates the manufacturing of a wide variety of products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


For more information on our manufacturing platform and technology see the section titled “Item 1. Business—Our Manufacturing Platform.” 
 OUR BUSINESS MODEL AND GROWTH STRATEGY 
 Given the advantages of our platform, we aim to make the benefits of RNA, and other biologics, accessible to everyone. 
 In human health, we are developing vaccines and RNA therapeutics to alleviate or cure critical diseases facing patients worldwide. In agriculture, we are developing products that promote sustainability and supplement or replace traditional pesticides and fungicides with RNA in farmers’ crop-protection programs. 
 Our platform gives rise to three distinct capabilities that underpin a sustainable business model and bring capabilities normally used in advanced pharma discovery to agriculture and human health: 
 

• | Identification: Machine learning and proprietary algorithms are key tools as we work to identify the best gene target candidates. We become more efficient and innovative as we accumulate data, and our algorithms learn.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Develop and optimize: We run parallel trials on thousands of distinct RNA sequences to design our agricultural products, which gives us many more opportunities to develop the best products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Manufacturing: We can produce dsRNA products through our proprietary cell-free system. Our current production capacity is 2,000 liters per batch, and we are planning to build the capacity to produce dsRNA at a rate of at least 10,000 liters per batch. Production at larger capacities will allow us to achieve economies of scale by reducing labor costs and the fixed costs that we allocate to each liter of RNA that we produce.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In the next five years, our pipeline includes seven agricultural products planned for launch and five human health products with clinical milestones, including Phase I clinical trials. 
 We anticipate this pipeline will demonstrate: 
 

• | Fast development of agricultural products.Calantha will, if approved in 2022, have taken four years from start to market compared to a typical 10-year cycle at major agribusinesses.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rapid integration of acquisitions. We acquired Bayer’s topical RNA treatment for honeybees in December 2020. By May 2021, we were conducting further field trials and intend to be ready for regulatory submission in 2022.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Validation of our mRNA platform. We are working toward clinical proof of concept of our COVID-19 and influenza mRNA vaccines.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



4 

  
• | Innovative approaches to gene editing. We have the potential to tackle grave diseases such as sickle cell, for which we received a $3.3 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expansion of production capabilities. Our Rochester RNA manufacturing facility can produce 500 kg of dsRNA per year with the capability to expand to 1,000 kg. It currently provides samples for our field trials.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


These factors allow us to access the following major markets (with estimated total addressable market size in parentheses): 
 

• | Insecticides ($17 billion)
--+---------------------------


• | Fungicides ($16.5 billion)
--+---------------------------


• | Vaccines ($93 billion)
--+-----------------------


• | Gene therapies ($3 billion)
--+----------------------------


Our growth strategy in plant health is to pursue significant market opportunities where RNA has the greatest potential to provide growers with improved pest control and the sustainable nature of our products (e.g., benefits to honeybees and low to no residue) delivers the most impact for society and aligns most closely with macro trends from consumers and regulators. When we use the term ‘sustainable,’ we refer to our efforts to align economic development with environmental protection and human well-being as well as our anticipated obligations as a Public Benefit Corporation under § 362(a) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
 For our plant health products, we define total addressable market as the global revenue opportunity available to pesticide solutions controlling a target pest or disease. In most instances, we do this by defining a relevant active ingredient market for the crop or crops where we intend to market our products and then making an assumption as to the percentage of that market that is spent on controlling the target pest or disease. We use data from AgBioinvestor and FAOSTAT (a database run by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations), and data purchased from third party consultants is used to quantify the market and underpin assumptions. In order to address the total insecticide and fungicide markets we identify pests or diseases in that market, develop targeted dsRNA sequences for them and attempt to develop the best delivery mechanism for that dsRNA. Over time, we intend to expand beyond RNA, building on our capabilities. In human health, we intend to pursue markets where RNA can provide better products (faster, cost effective or more efficacious) to improve standards of care for patients. 
 Planned products and milestones 
 Agricultural programs we currently have planned for launch in the next five years include protection against: 
 

• | Colorado potato beetle, 2022
--+-----------------------------


• | Varroa mite, 2024
--+------------------


• | Botrytis, 2025
--+---------------


• | Fusarium, 2025
--+---------------


• | Powdery mildew, 2025
--+---------------------


• | Diamondback moth, 2026
--+-----------------------


• | Two-spotted spider mite, 2026
--+------------------------------


Key planned human health clinical milestones in the next five years include Phase I clinical trials currently targeted for: 
 

• | COVID-19 vaccine, 2022 (currently in animal toxicity studies)
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Our Covid-19 vaccine has successfully completed preclinical testing and we are preparing a Clinical Trials Application, or CTA, with the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority, or SAHPRA, which, if approved, will allow clinical testing on human subjects. Depending on the results of any clinical testing in South Africa, we may decide to file an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application with the FDA for our COVID-19 vaccine candidate. Our other product candidates in the human health pipeline have yet to reach the Pre-IND phase. To get to the Pre-IND phase for our other product candidates in our human health pipeline, we must design and test the product candidates in animal models, select the product candidates to progress to IND-enabling toxicology studies, develop chemistry, manufacturing, and controls protocols, and create a development plan to discuss with the FDA as part of pre-IND consultations. 
 In order to begin any Phase I clinical trials, we must first successfully complete the toxicity study for the product candidate, submit an IND application to the FDA, which will include the scope of our proposed Phase I clinical trial, and satisfy any conditions the FDA may require for the IND to become effective. Additionally, in order to begin our Phase I clinical trials, we must first produce the Phase I clinical drug substance for each of the product candidates, which will require us to complete the start-up of the two clean room suites that we recently leased in Burlington, Massachusetts, including compliance with applicable GMP regulations and conformity to our chemistry, manufacturing and controls protocols. Our Burlington facility is currently GMP-ready. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Manufacturing Platform.” Our Burlington facility completed the production of the drug substance for the Phase I clinical trial of our COVID-19 vaccine product candidate. Fill and finish manufacturing is planned for the first and second quarter of 2022. 
 OUR MANUFACTURING PLATFORM 
 Our platform, developed through 13 years of research and technology development, is protected by foundational patents and know-how that address barriers cell-free technologies have faced for many years. 
 Biologic production through living cells faces a range of constraints. These include the cell’s priority for self-preservation, which fights against RNA production, reducing yield and quality. 
 Conventional cell-free production breaks open the cells and removes the need to balance bioprocessing against self-preservation. But energy management in this method limits yield and quality, making RNA production prohibitive for many agricultural applications in terms of cost, scale, and speed. 
 Our proprietary cell-free process regenerates the energy needed for bioprocessing using ingredients that can include polyphosphates and enzymes. 
 Each step in the GreenLight bioproduction processes has been developed or selected with cost and functionality in mind. 
 

• | The key raw material for dsRNA can be obtained in large quantities from such sources as industrial fermentation processes (e.g., derived from yeast).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our proprietary process allows us to energize naturally occurring nucleoside monophosphates at low cost using inorganic polyphosphate, which is readily available and affordable.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Thermophilic enzymes are employed to facilitate the production of high-energy nucleotides. The utilization of thermally stable enzymes allows high temperature to be incorporated in their preparation, providing a way to mitigate undesirable contaminating activities (e.g., RNA-degrading enzymes, DNA-degrading enzymes, nucleotide-degrading/altering enzymes, protein-degrading enzymes) from entering the RNA synthesis portion of the process and affecting quality and yield.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We believe our process know-how and the technology we developed can be leveraged for our mRNA platform.

Overview of manufacturing process for agriculture 

  Our proprietary dsRNA manufacturing process for agriculture begins with a cellular RNA (e.g., from yeast). 
 This is then broken up (depolymerized) into RNA building blocks (commonly known as NMPs) using a nuclease enzyme. Our cell-free production process uses carefully selected enzymes to energize and polymerize the building blocks into a desired RNA according to a corresponding DNA template. 
 Cell-free production of dsRNA for agriculture 
 While the advantages of dsRNA for agriculture have been known for some time, production cost has been a barrier.

The outcome from our system is fast, with reaction times of two hours. We have successfully increased production from 50 microliters to more than 1,000 liters without significant loss in performance. 
 Overview of manufacturing process for human health 
 We have deep understanding and expertise in RNA manufacturing, design, and analysis. The many years of experience from our dsRNA platform are applicable to our human health mRNA platform. We are continually leveraging what we learn and applying it to mRNA production for human health applications. 
 State-of-the art production of mRNA molecules currently available commercially (for example, in the approved Covid-19 mRNA vaccines) employs in vitro transcription (IVT). The process depends on a ready supply of highly purified reagents, including chemically produced nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs), an RNA polymerase enzyme, and a DNA template. RNA is synthesized, capped, and tailed for protein translation and encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNP) for delivery to target cells in the patient. Importantly, mRNA used for human health requires purification steps to reach the highest quality levels expected by regulatory agencies. 
 Encapsulation 
 Our current mRNA drug product is based on lipid nanoparticles that encapsulate mRNA molecules, protecting them from degradation. Those nanoparticles enable mRNA uptake into the cells so that the mRNA can be used to express the protein of interest. 
 Our current nanoparticles are made of four lipids: the ionizable lipid that drives encapsulation and release of mRNA, two “helper” lipids that mainly provide stability to the particle itself, and a polyethylene-glycol lipid that prevents particle aggregation as well as opsonization once those particles are injected in the bloodstream. 
 The manufacturing process for mRNA-LNP involves two liquid streams colliding at high velocity in a jet-mixing chamber. One of the streams contains the lipids in organic solvents and the other stream contains the mRNA in acidified water. The mixing at high velocity reduces solubility of the lipids so that homogeneous nanoparticles are formed around a core made of mRNA and ionizable lipid. 
 
9 

  After the mixture is quenched to stop particle growth, the organic solvent is removed, the pH is neutralized, and the mRNA-LNP is concentrated. 
 A cryoprotectant is added at the end of the process before the product is sterile-filtered and stored in ultra-cold conditions.

Supply for research and development 
 We have a team dedicated to the manufacturing of materials for discovery and preclinical research in Massachusetts. Our team produces 1 to 20 mg of mRNA with a turnaround time of a few weeks, and we have technology-transferred in-house LNP manufacturing capability to support preclinical and clinical studies. 
 Supply for clinical trials 
 In August 2021, we began activating a manufacturing facility in Massachusetts that is capable of producing material for clinical trials and is implementing current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) systems to support the use of these materials in human trials. The first clinical materials to be produced in this facility, which were for our COVID-19 vaccine candidate, were manufactured in 2021, and we expect to follow with production for other programs entering the clinical phase. We have also produced mRNA and LNP formulations for IND-enabling toxicology studies under Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) procedures. We contract specialized third parties that meet our requirements and are experienced in cGMP fill-finish operations. 
 Our manufacturing for agriculture: Rochester (dsRNA) 
 Our dsRNA manufacturing facility in Rochester, New York, is designed for process development while generating samples for research and market development with a 1,000 kg dsRNA production design basis. The facility has a raw material storage and handling area, high bay wet-processing area with floor drains, two, 1,200-liter fermenters, 2,000-liter cell-free reactors, NMP preparation tanks, formulation, packaging, development laboratory, analytical laboratory, loading dock, and cold storage areas. This plant currently has 15 process engineers, technicians, research associates, and quality-control personnel for commercial production of plant health products. 
 In the third quarter of 2021, we increased production of dsRNA from microliter, milliliter and liter quantities in the lab to 2,000 liters per batch using a single bioreactor installed at our Rochester facility with no material impact on quality or process yields. We estimate that we can currently produce 500 kg of dsRNA per year with this capacity. We have also installed a second 2,000-liter bioreactor at our Rochester facility as part of our plan to increase manufacturing capacity. If brought online, this bioreactor would double our capacity to 1,000 kg of dsRNA per year. If we obtain the appropriate regulatory approvals to commercialize our products as we project in our agricultural product pipeline, we expect that this capacity will enable us to meet our agricultural product needs through mid-2024. We are currently designing an expansion of our Rochester facility to further increase our manufacturing capacity of dsRNA for agricultural use and have recently leased an additional 5,577 square feet of laboratory space in Rochester for this added capacity.

  Our manufacturing for human health (mRNA) 
 We currently make mRNA at our cleanroom facility in Burlington, Massachusetts. We have scaled our production to approximately three liters and plan to use a contract development and manufacturing organization, or CDMO, to produce mRNA in larger quantities. 
 We have agreements to produce early clinical materials for the COVID-19 program, which are expected to be filled, labeled, and packaged for the clinic by contract manufacturing organizations. 
 Our Burlington facility completed the production of the drug substance for the Phase I clinical trial of our COVID-19 vaccine product candidate. Fill and finish manufacturing is planned for the first and second quarter of 2022. 
 We are implementing cGMP systems to support clinical production using our process. 
 We produced our first 3-liter clinical batch using our proprietary process and will use the wild-type Wuhan COVID-19 strain. This material will follow the same supply chain but will use an IVT production process currently in development, akin to existing vaccines, in the upstream. 
 The downstream purification process consists of filtration and chromatography steps. The purified material is formulated in a lipid nanoparticle system. The material is then sent to a contract manufacturer to fill into vials and is stored frozen. 
 In November 2021, we engaged Samsung Biologics Co., Ltd. (“Samsung”) as a contract development and manufacturing organization for our mRNA COVID-19 vaccine pursuant to a Master Services Agreement (the “MSA”) and a Product Specific Agreement (the “PSA”, and together with the MSA, the “Samsung Agreements”). Under the Samsung Agreements, Samsung will perform pharmaceutical development and manufacturing services for us over a period of years at its South Korean facility in exchange for service fees. Under these agreements, we must purchase certain minimum quantities of drug products. We agreed that, if we enter into a purchase agreement for commercial quantities of drug product, we will pay Samsung, on a minimum take-or-pay basis for each year under that agreement, for our minimum purchase commitments, as determined pursuant to the terms of the Samsung Agreements. Based on our minimum purchase commitments, we expect to pay Samsung a minimum of approximately $11.5 million in service fees under the Samsung Agreements, excluding the cost of raw materials, which we must supply to Samsung separately. These fees include initial technology and analytical method transfer fees, process development and scale-up fees, process characterization fees, an annual project management fee, and per-batch engineering and cGMP run fees. Based on our current schedule, we expect to incur the substantial majority of these expenses in 2022 and a portion in 2023. If we move to commercial production, the agreement provides for additional process validation, inspection, cleaning, stability testing and commercial production fees, most of which would be incurred on a per-batch basis. 
 The Samsung Agreements will terminate on December 31, 2026, unless earlier terminated or extended in accordance with their terms. If we terminate the Samsung Agreements, we will generally be responsible for paying the purchase price for our aggregate product commitment for the remainder of the term, less any amounts we have already paid. Samsung agreed that, at or before the end of the term of the Samsung Agreements, it will assist us to transfer the commercial scale manufacturing process to a facility designated by us. The Samsung Agreements impose limits on Samsung’s liability to us for breaches of the agreements. 
 HUMAN HEALTH PRODUCT PIPELINE 
 Our mRNA platform consists of: 
 

• | The manufacturing process used to produce the product (described above)
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The mRNA molecule
--+------------------


• | The delivery vehicle it uses to reach the target tissue
--+--------------------------------------------------------



12 

  All elements of the platform affect product characteristics, such as purity, potency, and immunogenicity, so our teams work on optimizing mRNA molecules and delivery vehicles for a given indication, and the performance and cost of the manufacturing process. 
 mRNA molecule design 
 Changes in the mRNA molecule will result in changes in the protein we are looking to express, the immune response to the product, and mRNA stability and potency. 
 First, we must choose the right target protein, after which an mRNA has to be designed for it. A well-designed mRNA molecule can carry instructions for the relevant protein, to be expressed efficiently and for the desired duration. The mRNA composition can be optimized to avoid undesirable immune responses while increasing protein expression, referred to as product potency. 
 Delivery vehicles 
 To facilitate the mRNA to reach its destination without degradation, we must formulate it into a delivery vehicle. The delivery system’s design can influence potency, immunogenicity, and the product’s shelf life. 
 One such delivery system consists of encapsulating mRNA in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). We work with several established companies that have extensive experience in clinical LNPs for our vaccine candidates. We are able to routinely produce our mRNA-containing LNPs to support our research and development efforts. In addition, we work on stabilizing the LNPs to improve the storage conditions and shelf life of our products. 
 Our human health pipeline 
 We are currently working on two modalities: 
 

• | Prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases
--+----------------------------------------------


• | Gene therapies
--+---------------


We are exploring ways to expand our pipeline to include additional therapeutic areas, including using antibodies, in the future. 
 Prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases 
 The objective of a prophylactic vaccine is to expose the body to a protein which is present in the disease-causing virus or bacterium, called the antigen, so that it can generate an immune response in the absence of the pathogen and be prepared to fight the actual infection, should it occur in the future. mRNA can potentially be used to encode the antigen as a way to expose the body to a component of the pathogen, avoiding the use of a whole infectious agent. 
 Vaccines that use mRNAs present significant advantages compared to non-mRNA vaccines, including: 
 

• | The antigen expressed is a true match to the protein present in the pathogen, thus increasing the potential for quality of the immune response as compared to vaccines produced through other methods, in which manufacturing processes may result in changes to the antigen.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The short development time from antigen selection to clinical trials makes mRNA ideal for emerging epidemics or pandemic response. This is why mRNA vaccines have been among the fastest developed for COVID-19.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The same manufacturing plant can be used to produce different mRNA vaccines.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------



13 

  Opportunity 
 Immunization with prophylactic vaccines has become one of the most successful of all healthcare interventions. It is estimated that vaccines prevent 6 million deaths every year. The global vaccine market in 2019 was estimated at $33 billion, with the surge of the COVID-19 pandemic representing a significant growth in the market to $93 billion in 2020. 
 Our COVID-19 vaccine candidate 
 Unmet need 
 Although a large portion of the population in high-income countries has been vaccinated against COVID-19, widespread vaccination is not expected in mid- and low-income countries until mid-2022 or early 2023. To keep COVID-19 at bay, a periodic booster may be necessary as global herd immunity is unlikely to be achieved. Current research is ongoing to determine if booster shots will be necessary to cover waning immunity or new variants. 
 Product concept 
 Our COVID-19 vaccine candidate, GLB-CoV-2-043, will use mRNA to encode a spike protein of the Wuhan strain, and/or a spike protein of a SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern, formulated in LNPs. 
 Achievements to date and future milestones 
 Our COVID-19 vaccine candidate has successfully completed preclinical testing, and we are preparing to file a Clinical Trials Application, or CTA, with the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority, or SAHPRA, seeking approval to initiate phase 1 clinical studies in South Africa. Hamsters (16/group) were immunized at day 0 and 21 at three dose levels of 5 µg, 30 µg, and 100 µg of vaccine or controls of saline or LNP. At day 40 of the study the animals were intra-nasally challenged with live SARS-CoV-2 virus (isolate USA-WA1/2020). Animals were followed for 14 days, and their weights were taken daily. This hamster challenge study revealed that all doses of GLB-CoV-2-043 provided protection from SARS-CoV-2 challenge using percent body weight (% BW) change as a criterion. We observed a statistically significant (p < 0.0001) reduction in weight loss, compared to controls on Day 6, the peak of disease, and Day 14, the end of the challenge study.

  Hamsters (8/group) were immunized at day 0 and 21 at three dose levels of 5 µg, 30 µg, and 100 µg of vaccine or controls of saline or LNP (GLuc). Blood draws at day 21 (pre-boost: before injection of the second vaccine dose), and day 39 (post-boost: that is, 18 days after the second dose) were tested for neutralizing antibody titers against live SARS-CoV-2 virus (isolate USA-WA1/2020).
All vaccine doses tested induced significantly higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titer compared to controls, both Pre and Post-Boost. The 100 µg and 30 µg doses of GLB-CoV-2-043 induced statistically significantly or trending towards statistically significantly higher titers of neutralizing antibodies compared to control immunized animals. The GLB-CoV-2-043 vaccine displayed a clear dose response after boost. These results demonstrated that GLB-CoV-2-043 mRNA vaccine candidate induces high titers of functional anti-SARS-CoV-2 capable of neutralizing virus entry into cells.

 The above chart presents SARS-Cov-2 serum neutralizing antibody titers (IC50, or inhibition concentration at 50%) for hamsters vaccinated with GLB-Cov-2-043 at day 21 (three weeks after the first vaccination dose) and at day 39 (18 days after the second vaccination dose). GLB-COV-2043 is the GreenLight vaccine candidate. 
 We have had a pre-IND consultation with the FDA regarding our approach to IND and Phase I clinical testing. We commenced IND-enabling toxicology studies in the third quarter of 2021. We have a license for an LNP from an established company for our COVID-19 vaccine candidate. 
 Upon approval of our CTA by SAHPRA, we expect to initiate a phase 1 safety and immunogenicity clinical trial in South Africa in the first half of 2022. We are also seeking partnership opportunities with a pharmaceutical company to conduct late-stage clinical trials and commercialize our vaccine. If we successfully complete our planned clinical trials, we plan to analyze the data and assess whether to submit an application package to regulatory authorities in jurisdictions outside the U.S. for emergency or full marketing authorization. It is possible that the regulatory authorities will no longer be accepting Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) submissions (or their equivalent) for COVID-19 vaccines at that time. If that is the case, we would need to assess whether and to what extent additional data would be needed to submit a Biologics License Application (BLA), or its equivalent in other jurisdictions, for full marketing authorization.

  Our seasonal influenza vaccine candidate 
 Unmet need 
 Commercial influenza vaccines typically have a mismatch between the strains selected for the season and the strains circulating during the season, because selection occurs six months before influenza season—given the time required to manufacture vaccines. This, along with the viral mutations that occur in eggs during the manufacturing process, results in a variable vaccine efficacy of between 40% and 60%. 
 Along with manufacturing-process challenges, egg-based vaccines are slow to produce and there would likely be an insufficient supply of eggs to produce the vaccines necessary in a pandemic setting. 
 Our product concepts 
 Our influenza vaccine candidate is a multivalent vaccine consisting of mRNA encoding for two types of antigens, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), formulated in LNPs. We believe this combination of antigens has the potential to provide a protective immune response to influenza viruses. 
 Achievements to date and future milestones 
 We have formulation design and testing activities underway for our seasonal influenza mRNA vaccine program. We are testing prototype formulations in mice and ferret models, and plan to evaluate resulting data and consult with the FDA to select a candidate for pre-clinical, IND-enabling, toxicology testing. Based on our current projected timeline, and if our preclinical studies are successful, we anticipate selecting a clinical candidate, in the first half of 2022 to undertake IND-enabling toxicology studies for a clinical Phase I trial starting in 2023 . We have an option to license LNP for our influenza vaccine candidate from an established LNP company. We will seek partnership with an established pharmaceutical company to conduct clinical development trials and, if our clinical studies are successful, commercialize our influenza vaccine. 
 Gene therapies 
 There are thousands of genetic diseases caused by mutations in single genes. Patients with many of these diseases are not yet well-served by existing therapies. Although there are treatments for certain genetic diseases, sometimes the treatments alleviate symptoms temporarily or require organ, bone marrow, or stem cell transplants. These are costly, time-consuming, and logistically challenging. We aspire to develop our technology to edit the specifically targeted gene to treat such diseases by simple injections of mRNA/LNP formulations consisting of the gene and molecular machinery for its integration into the genome. 
 Our sickle cell disease gene product concept 
 Unmet need 
 Sickle cell disease affects about 100,000 people in just the United States and is prevalent in people of African and Middle Eastern descent. There is no cure for sickle cell disease, and current treatments focus on managing the pain crises and other effects such as anemia. Current treatment regimens—including blood transfusions and bone marrow transplants—are costly, invasive, and impractical for treating large segments of affected patient populations. Gene therapies currently in development for sickle cell disease are cell therapies, which require facilities close to the patient that can edit the cells outside of the body, posing an additional challenge for populations in remote areas or without adequate facilities to perform the editing. 
 Current approaches to gene therapy have challenges to overcome. Therapies that use adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) as vectors can encapsulate and deliver genetic material of up to 5,000 base pairs only, which limits the diseases to which this technology can be applied.

  Product concept 
 Our RNA-based gene product concept is to design a product candidate to deliver a healthy copy of the gene to stem cells. We believe our gene therapy concept has the potential to be: 
 

• | Accessible: Based on our cost-competitive RNA platform and with an in vivo administration, we believe our therapy will enable us to bypass the need for facilities required to edit the cells ex vivo.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Targeted: The delivery technology targets specific cells in tissue.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | One dose and done: Our strategy is to target precursor stem cells to provide long-lasting expression.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Versatile: Our therapy has the potential to encode for full-length genes and address genetic indications that require therapy in nondividing cells.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Our work in gene therapy is supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. This work involves reduction to practice of novel approaches for gene therapy using mRNA and cell/tissue targeting. We anticipate being ready for preclinical toxicology studies at the end of 2024. 
 Early Stage R&D 
 Our supra-seasonal influenza and antibody therapy targets utilize the mRNA platform technology used for our SARSCoV-2 vaccine candidate. These targets are currently in the early stages of concept evaluation in terms of antigen or protein design and in-vitro testing. If we succeed in these endeavors we anticipate selecting clinical candidates in 2024. 
 GLOBAL RNA MANUFACTURING NETWORK 
 Our vision is to enable Africa, Asia, and Latin America to meet local demand through production outside the United States and Europe, from drug substance to product to fill and finish of mRNA vaccines and therapies, ideally in the country where the vaccine will be sold. If our vaccines and therapies are approved in these jurisdictions, we intend to contract with local manufacturers to produce our products, which we believe will enable the accessibility and cost competitiveness of our products. 
 If we obtain applicable regulatory approvals, we intend to create an interoperable network with local production facilities deploying our manufacturing process using modular design concepts that can be constructed off-site and set up more quickly than traditional construction models, so each facility will rely less on international supply chains to create vaccines and therapies for local needs. 
STRATEGIC COLLABORATIONS 
 Collaborators are part of our core strategy as we seek to accelerate our development of RNA therapies. We have relationships with research hospitals, universities, foundations, biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies, and nongovernmental organizations with expertise in our pipeline programs. During research and development stages, we seek collaborators to complement our preclinical studies and manufacturing capabilities. At the clinical development stage, we will seek established collaborators to codevelop or commercialize our product candidates. For vaccines, we are seeking companies with commercial capabilities that will receive rights to develop and commercialize our vaccine candidate. In this way, we can share the risk and reward of our portfolio while acquiring the capabilities required to launch commercial products. We seek partners aligned with our mission of making RNA accessible to the world. 
 Our decision to partner will be determined by the partner’s geographic scope and the complementary capabilities that partner can bring to support the commercialization of products. We have yet to choose either the 
 
17 

  products for which we choose to partner, or the partners themselves; however, we may also choose to commercialize some early-stage programs without partners, as large-scale commercial capabilities may not be required for programs with a small patient population. 
 PLANT HEALTH PRODUCT PIPELINE 
 Overview 
 We plan to design, build, and sell a complete portfolio of products that growers can use throughout the food chain, from field to fork, to enhance, protect, and preserve produce and animals. 
 Our product pipeline is based on double-stranded RNA, or dsRNA, which works by regulating the expression of a carefully selected protein in the target organism, be it in plants, fungi, or animals (primarily insects or arachnids). This method can, with careful selection of the appropriate target, potentially be used to control a wide range of unwanted pests and problems. 
 An introduction to dsRNA and agriculture 
 As a tool for crop protection, dsRNA has several advantages. It is designed to impact the target pest and limit harm to any non-targeted organisms. Unlike many other pesticides, dsRNA degrades quickly in the environment, so it is typically undetectable after a few days, meaning in typical use, treated produce would contain low to no pesticide residue. Finally, in the event any residue remains, there is an established history of safe consumption of RNA molecules in human and animal food. According to a September 2020 report published by the Environmental Directorate of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development entitled Considerations for the Environmental Risk Assessment of the Application of Sprayed or Externally Applied ds-RNA-Based Pesticides, there is a long-established view that dietary intake of nucleic acids, including dsRNAs from plant viruses, does not present a health risk to humans and other vertebrates, and, as a result, the adoption of RNAi technology in agriculture is likely to present a lower human health risk than the use of conventional pesticides. 
 Based on our toxicity testing and these advantages of dsRNA, GreenLight has requested a tolerance exemption from the EPA for the active ingredient contained in its first dsRNA product, GS2, which seeks to control Colorado Potato Beetle in potatoes and other solanaceous crops. If granted, such an exemption would be consistent with a category IV toxicity level, the EPA’s lowest level of pesticide toxicity under FIFRA. 
 Process for developing new products 
 GreenLight uses a five-phase product development process for plant and animal health products as summarized in the following table. In general, in order for a product to move to a particular stage, it must successfully have met the requirements of the preceding stages.

Market opportunity 
 Given the versatility of RNA-based solutions, we believe that the markets for our products are large. In the near term, we intend to pursue more than $10 billion in addressable target markets for plant health, with the full launch of our first product anticipated in 2023. 
 We define total addressable market as the global revenue opportunity available to pesticide solutions controlling a target pest or disease. In most instances, we do this by defining a relevant active ingredient market for the crop or crops where we intend to market our products and then making an assumption as to the percentage of that market that is spent on controlling the target pest or disease. We use data from AgbioInvestor and FAOSTAT (a database run by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations), and we use data purchased from third-party consultants to quantify the market and underpin assumptions. 
 We intend to develop products for our own distribution as well as for commercial partners. In doing so, we will focus our attention on the fresh fruits, vegetables, and nuts markets, which urgently need residue-free crop- protection products or have a strong association with the need to conserve honeybees. We will seek to serve the broadacre markets and international markets through partnerships with established multinational crop-protection companies and distributors. We intend to develop products that farmers trust and incorporate as a regular part of their annual crop-protection program. 
 Each of the initial products we are developing is intended to be specific to one target pest based on grower needs. We believe we can leverage our expertise in RNA in the future to target multiple pests as well as use our manufacturing platform and experience to make novel products at a cost that works for farmers. 
 What specific problems are we trying to solve? 
 Our Plant Health group is working to provide growers with highly effective tools to use within their normal cultural practices that avoid disrupting non-target organisms while leaving low to no residue in the treated produce. Today there are very few commercially available products that successfully combine these characteristics that growers, regulators, and consumers desire. Our primary focus for this mission is the successful deployment of carefully designed dsRNA. In order for our products to function successfully, the organism that needs to be managed must possess the appropriate cellular apparatus to process exogenous dsRNA to regulate protein biosynthesis. For these organisms, we intend to develop a portfolio of insecticides, acaricides, fungicides, and products that affect crop physiology and health, such as bio stimulants and herbicides. 
 
19 

  Insecticides and acaricides 
 Our insecticides and acaricides program is currently working on six major targets with a combined addressable target market size of $4.4 billion. These projects are distributed across various phases ranging from the most advanced, which is in the pre-commercial phase awaiting regulatory approval, to nascent candidates. We calculate addressable markets for our projects using market data from AgbioInvestor and FAOSTAT and information purchased from third-party consultants. We use this data as well as our industry knowledge to inform assumptions around expenditures to control the target pest or disease to arrive at the addressable market. 
 Calantha, our program to control the Colorado potato beetle, has been submitted to the EPA for approval. Another, aimed at Varroa mites, is expected to be submitted to the EPA in 2022. We anticipate moving the program for diamond back moth to the field in 2022 or 2023, with EPA submission in 2023. Additionally, we project to submit our two spotted spider mite product to the EPA for approval in 2024. 
 Colorado potato beetle 
 Calantha, our product candidate for the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata), which decimates plants in the nightshade family and accounts for more than $500 million in crop loss annually, has gone from discovery to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) submission in four years. The application is mixed with water and sprayed using standard agricultural practice over crops at a rate of 9.9 grams per hectare—less than one-tenth the rate at which many conventional industrial chemicals are normally used on fields. Consumption of the dsRNA, which itself degrades within days, causes the Colorado potato beetle to stop eating and expire from its own toxins while beneficial insects are unaffected. In the United States, we have tested this product over the last three annual growing seasons in Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin, New York, Maine and Idaho. We have also conducted field tests of the product in Spain, Germany and France. 
 We believe the addressable market for protecting crops from the Colorado potato beetle is approximately $350 million. Assuming EPA approval in 2022, we anticipate full commercialization in 2023. 
 Widely recognized for its ability to develop resistance to pesticides, the Colorado potato beetle was first described as a pest in the United States in 1859. 
 We expect the price and performance of Calantha, the first-ever foliar RNA product—submitted for regulatory approval with the EPA in October 2020—to be competitive with other products currently available to farmers. We have conducted more than 100 field trials over four years to develop a product that is effective at just 9.9 g/hectare, an extremely low active ingredient use rate, equivalent to a spoonful of sugar spread on a football field. 
 Our testing has shown that Calantha is safe for honeybees, butterflies, and several other non-target insects and mammals at use rates 100 times higher than our recommended rate. It degrades in water and soil within three days to benign, natural nucleotides. The product works well with standard growers’ programs to control first- or second-generation Colorado potato beetle. It effectively controls all stages of the life of this beetle but is most effective on young larvae up to one-quarter inch in length. 
 In addition to being water soluble, this product contains additional inert ingredients to allow it to be mixed with other agricultural products and applied by farmers in a single spraying using common methods, including low-water volume (aerial or ground) or chemigation. Although conventional pesticides can require special protective equipment for farmers, we anticipate just basic work gloves will be required for this product. 
 Varroa mites 
 Having acquired the rights to portions of Bayer’s topical RNA intellectual property portfolio, which include bee-health assets, we are developing an RNA-based syrup that targets reproductive mites, is easy to use, and will add another tool in the limited Varroa-control market. 
 
20 

 
  We have been field testing our RNA-based product candidate for the Varroa destructor mite, which many beekeepers consider to be the top threat to honeybees and which has been detected in up to 90% of US hives, since March 2021 with the assistance of commercial beekeepers in Georgia, California, Florida, and Maine. To date, these tests demonstrate a measurable improvement in hive health. Hive health is measured by bee management personnel through a visual assessment of open broods (uncapped hive cells containing larvae) and closed broods (capped hive cells containing larvae) and the assignment of scores based on that assessment. The assessment also includes a scored evaluation of the overall health of the hive, including appearance and productivity of drones, brood health and queen health. Hive health measurements attempt to take into account a variety of factors other than mite count and include potential harmful effects from the pathogens mites can introduce into the hive, the potential harmful effects of chemical pesticides and other environmental factors that can affect overall hive health. Our tests measured hive health 12 weeks after application of our Varroa mite product and demonstrated a 20% improvement in open brood health (p=0.0193), a 20% improvement in closed brood health (p=0.0163) and a 17% improvement in overall hive health (p=0.0200), compared to hive health measured 12 weeks after application of the commercial standard chemical Varroa mite control product. As part of our hive health assessments, we also assess mite population and control before and after application of our product, using guidelines from the USDA’s Agricultural Research Services for measuring mite populations. Using these guidelines in our field tests, we observed a decline in mite population of 80% 6 weeks after treatment (p=0.0073) and 77% 12 weeks after treatment (p=0.0106) after the application of our product. 
 About 3 million commercial honeybee colonies in the United States are used to pollinate more than 100 crops annually that are worth an estimated $15 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The parasitic Varroa mite reproduces in hives, feeds on honeybees, and spreads disease, destroying colonies across the globe. Now in the development phase, our product candidate targets the Varroa mite to protect bees, beekeepers, and pollination-dependent crops. 
 When we acquired rights from Bayer relating to its bee-health assets, Bayer disclosed to us that in laboratory tests its original Varroa mite product had been observed to have adverse effects on ladybugs. We are developing our own version of this product using our proprietary manufacturing process, and our product has a different composition than the Bayer product. We have observed adverse effects on ladybugs in laboratory tests of products made with our dsRNA manufacturing process but at 10x higher use rates than Bayer observed. We do not believe that such data will negatively impact our ability to secure a registration from the EPA or impact the attractiveness of our product to potential customers for two reasons. First, during the normal course of use, our product would be delivered in a sealed package directly to beehives, and it is atypical for ladybugs to enter a treated beehive during the proposed treating season. Accordingly, it is unlikely that the organisms that may be negatively affected would be exposed to the product during the normal course of use. Second, we believe that customers would conclude that the benefits of controlling Varroa mites outweigh the potential risks to ladybugs. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Animal Health Program” for a discussion of several risks factors relating to our Varroa mite product. Nonetheless, until we complete our field trials, it is unclear whether we will be able to limit delivery of our product to bees and, through bees, to Varroa mites, in a manner that will effectively impede mite function. 
 In preparation for seeking EPA approval of our Varroa mite product, we have been conducting laboratory and field tests, including a required high-dose test to assess risks associated with potential overexposure to the product. When we tested our Varroa mite product in the laboratory at the required level of ten times the field use rate, the higher concentration of the product caused the treated bee food to become highly viscous, which limited consumption and resulted in bee starvation. We did not observe these adverse effects either when our product was administered at the field use rate or when our product was administered at the high-dose rate in the field. Because our product is delivered in a ready-to-use formulation through a pre-measured pouch delivery system, rather than through conventional spraying, we do not believe that our product presents a material risk that bees will be exposed to concentrations greater than the field use rate. For more information regarding potential adverse effects on regulatory approval of our Varroa mite product if the EPA does not agree to modify its safety factor protocol, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Animal Health Program — The EPA will

21 

  evaluate our Varroa mite product without a precedent product, which may result in the need to conduct additional field trials and lengthen the regulatory review period. If we cannot reduce bee mortality experienced in high-dose safety factor testing, the EPA may not approve our product or may impose labeling requirements that materially limit the commercial attractiveness of the product.” 
 In order to submit a registration dossier to the EPA in 2022, we need to complete additional studies required for the initial submission, including a bee safety study that is only available seasonally. This study is part of the normal course of an EPA registration and generally cannot be conducted during cold winter months. We are currently conducting this study, and additional non-target organism studies are in progress during the spring of 2022 for inclusion in the dossier we plan to submit to the EPA. For the United States registration of our Varroa mite product, we will be able to submit for approval under the FIFRA regulations, and we expect to make the submission in the second or third quarter of 2022. In certain foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union, we expect that we will be required to apply for authorization of our Varroa mite product as an animal health product under applicable veterinary medicine regulations. 
 Diamond Back Moth 
 The Diamond Back Moth (Plutella xylostella) is sometimes called the cabbage moth because of its voracious appetite for consuming brassicas plants, which include cabbage, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower, among others. It represents a global challenge to farmers and growers because its short life cycle allows it to rapidly develop resistance to existing crop protection products. 
 By testing Diamond Back Moth larvae in greenhouse assays (where they are fed foliage treated with their specific RNA sequence combined with the different delivery technologies we have developed), we believe that the Diamond Back Moth can be controlled with a dsRNA-based pesticide. We are now testing delivery methods by which the product would be delivered to the field. If we successfully develop delivery mechanisms, we expect to enter the field-testing stage for the product. If a successful delivery mechanism is developed, we anticipate moving into our pre-development phase in 2022 and the development phase in 2023, with the goal of a 2026 launch, subject to receipt of regulatory approval. 
 Two Spotted Spider Mite 
 Two spotted spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) (TSSM) are not insects but arachnids that feed on plants. All life cycle stages of the mite will cause damage to the plants upon which they feed. TSSM use their mouthparts to pierce cells on the surface of the leaf to suck out the contents, rendering the cell useless. TSSM will feed on a wide range of crops from Glasshouse ornamentals to tree nuts and fruits to corns and soybeans and can be found almost anywhere crops are grown. This project is currently in the discovery phase where we are seeing good control from our on-plant assays without any need to develop any specific delivery technology. We anticipate progression into pre-development in 2023 and move rapidly on to development in 2024 by having an initial focus on controlled environment crops. 
 Fungicides 
 Our fungicides program currently has six major targets in the pipeline with a combined total addressable market of $7.2 billion. This includes botrytis, fusarium, powdery mildew, downy mildew, Asian soybean rust, and rice blast. We calculate addressable markets for our projects using market data from AgbioInvestor and FAOSTAT and information purchased from third-party consultants. We use this data as well as our industry knowledge to inform assumptions around expenditures to control the target pest or disease to arrive at addressable market. 
 Our fungicide programs for botrytis and powdery mildew control are currently being field tested, and we expect to make an EPA submission in 2023. We also expect to submit our fusarium program to the EPA in 2023. 


22 

  Botrytis 
 Botrytis cinerea, which causes grey mold and bunch rot, is an ever-present global threat for fresh fruit and vegetables that affects 80% of crops grown and can result in up to 30% yield loss. Even greater losses can occur when botrytis develops en route to the consumer. Given how frequently crops such as grapes, berries, and onions need to be sprayed, resistance to existing chemical fungicides can build quickly and produce can carry residues of multiple products. Botrytis has long been a target for new biological fungicides, but excessive rain or humidity means that very few of these products can be relied on to work consistently. 
 

We began testing our Botrytis product in California, New York and Italy in 2021 and anticipate one more year of field testing before applying to the EPA for product approval in 2023. Assuming an 18-24 month EPA approval cycle, we would expect to begin commercialization in 2025. California, a major market for this product, could lag EPA approval by up to a year or more. Because this product demonstrated disease control in the field on both of the crops that we tested (strawberries and grapes), we progressed the project into Phase 2, the pre-development phase, at our portfolio review in December 2021. We believe we can move this project into Phase 3 of our development process at the end of 2022, which we believe would allow us to move through the remaining development phases and, subject to receipt of regulatory approval, into the market by 2025. 
 Grapevine powdery mildew 
 Powdery mildew, caused by Erysiphe necator, is the most common and destructive disease affecting grapes. Mostly observed on the upper surface of leaves as a dusty gray or white coating, the disease also strikes the lower surface, young stems, buds, flowers, canes, and fruit. Severely infected leaves may exhibit mottling or deformity, including leaf curling and withering. Infected fruit turn grayish-white first, then exhibit a brown, rusted appearance and may crack, shrivel, or drop from clusters. 
 We conducted our first season of field trials in 2021 in New York and California, and we were able to demonstrate disease control comparable to current leading chemical-control products. We anticipate one more year of field trials with the goal of regulatory submission in 2023. Assuming the EPA approves the product in 2025, we would expect to begin commercialization that year. California, a major market for this product, could lag EPA approval by up to a year or more, and non-US grape growing regions such as France could also take one or more additional years to obtain approval. Because this product demonstrated disease control in the field on both of the crops that we tested (strawberries and grapes), we progressed into Phase 2, the pre-development phase, at our portfolio review in December 2021. We believe we can move this project into Phase 3 of our development process at the end of 2022, which we believe would allow us to move through the remaining development phases and, subject to receipt of regulatory approval, into the market by 2025. 
 
23 

  Fusarium Head Blight 
 Fusarium Head Blight is a disease of cereal crops most typically caused in the United States and Europe by Fusarium graminearum, though some other Fusarium species are implicated. Fusarium species have a wide host range and can cause many different types of damage to crops depending upon the type of crop plant and its growth stage at the time of infection. In the form of the disease in which it infects the flowering ear of the cereal crop, Fusarium does not necessarily rob the farmer of yield but instead frequently produces mycotoxins as part of its metabolic process. These mycotoxins can cause serious illness and even death when consumed in small quantities (the primary mycotoxin is deoxynivalenol, or DON, known colloquially as vomitoxin), so there is a detection limit in process food stuffs of 11 ppm. dsRNA can be designed to inhibit the metabolic pathway that produces the mycotoxins. We believe the ability to do this is a key differentiator for GreenLight. The current fungicides available to the grower will control the pathogen but do not provide reliable suppression of the mycotoxins. This product is currently in the “Discovery 1B” phase described above, with GreenLight having demonstrated under controlled conditions that it can stop mycotoxin production on growing wheat. Based on our product development to date, we believe we can move this project into Phase 3 of our development process in 2022, which we believe would allow us to move through the remaining development phases and into the market by 2025. 
 Crop physiology 
 The market for crop physiology, crop health, and herbicides is approximately $25 billion, based on data compiled by AgbioInvestor. Our activities in these areas have taught us how to deliver dsRNA into cells, so we are expanding our research to give us further opportunities in the crop-protection market. 
 Limitations we are working to overcome 
 The use of dsRNA as a crop-protection technology has been proposed since the discovery of the mechanisms of RNAi in the 1990s. A key barrier to the development of dsRNA was the cost of manufacturing RNA itself. 
 Our proprietary cell-free technology aims to solve this problem. Other technical, commercial, and social challenges remain, with delivery as the next challenge. Not all organisms will readily uptake dsRNA in the way that the Colorado potato beetle and Varroa mite do, and we need to deploy strategies that overcome barriers for lepidoptera (the rate of breakdown in the gut) or plants (passage across membranes). Much of our mid- and long-term pipeline target work relates to addressing the challenge of extending environmental stability both within the gut of target insects and on the leaves of sprayed plants. 
 Another perceived limitation of dsRNA is associated with its highly specific nature. While we believe that this specificity is a benefit because it can make the technology safer for beneficial insects and humans, we realize most products on the market are broad-spectrum, which is appealing to farmers because they enable farmers to control multiple pests or diseases at once. 
 Biotechnology and agriculture have a complicated history. We know that building trust with stakeholders is critical to ensuring smooth adoption. We seek to educate about dsRNA and the benefits of what it can do. By increasing awareness of the benefits of RNA biopesticides, we hope to form strong relationships with other sustainability-oriented initiatives and industry stakeholders who can help tell our story. 
 Our people and culture 
 At GreenLight, we celebrate the power of working together to address humanity’s challenges, meet the needs of underserved populations, and push the boundaries of scientific discovery. Our culture represents a team united by a common purpose of creating a more sustainable future by bringing food security, medicine, and 
 
24 

  healthcare to everyone. From the very beginning, our founders believed that our way forward would be based on equality, diversity, and inclusion (ED&I). These founding principles guide us every day as we seek to identify, attract, retain, incentivize, and develop a highly talented workforce. 
 Qualified team 
 Building a platform through RNA manufacturing to address food and agriculture markets and human health markets in vaccines and gene therapies requires deep technical and scientific expertise. 
 As of March 21, 2022, we have 312 full-time employees. Within our workforce, 271 employees are engaged in research and development and manufacturing operations and 41 are engaged in the shared business-enabling functions. Approximately 53% of our team members who are focused on research and development have master’s degrees or higher and approximately 38% of our team members have PhDs. Our employees are not represented by any labor union nor any collective-bargaining arrangement with respect to their employment with us. 
 In addition to our regular workforce, we are grateful for the collaboration, contributions, and support of a network of industry advisors, consultants, contractors, and temporary staff who make up the overall GreenLight team. 
 With ED&I principles as the foundation, we are focused on cultivating a team with diverse backgrounds and perspectives. We consider how we can better serve our colleagues of different genders, ethnicities, generations, educational achievements, sexual orientations, workstyles, and more. Our current senior management team is diverse: 50% of our Executive team members and Senior Vice Presidents are female. Additionally, approximately 40% of our Executive team identifies as a non-Caucasian racial or ethnic group (Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian or Native Hawaiian, other Pacific Islander, or two or more races). Our management team is committed to continuing to build a diverse team and a culture of inclusion to ensure that diverse perspectives thrive. 
 Numbers alone cannot capture the rich diversity of our company. However, we collect and report these numbers for transparency and as a marker of our continued efforts. Approximately 46% of our full-time employees self-identify as female and 45% of full-time employees self-identify as a non-Caucasian racial or ethnic group (as defined above). While we acknowledge that there is still work to be done, we are committed to doing our part to make real changes to address systemic bias and inequities. 
 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE (ESG) STRATEGY 
 Environmental and social impact is inherent to our purpose and the underlying reason our company was launched. We were founded to develop sustainable products for the biggest issues facing humanity and the planet. GreenLight scientists are developing new products for public health challenges and sustainable food production to feed a growing population. We believe our ESG strategy is fundamental to achieving our mission and underscores everything we do at GreenLight. 
 We are striving to optimize the environmental impact of our facilities and operations, but we recognize the greatest potential for impact is through our product development process and in our goal to design and manufacture RNA-based products to support human, animal and plant health more naturally and safely. 
 Environmental 
 There is a need to take immediate action to address the environmental crisis that is forcing the reconsideration of how products are made, from our homes to our food, to our clothing. Many modern approaches to produce food and drugs to keep the growing population healthy have had a negative effect on the 
 
25 

 
  health of the planet. Clear cutting forests for cattle, chemical residues on food, in the water and in the soil, nitrogen blooms in rivers, declining soil productivity, the loss of bees and other beneficial insects—these are all clear signs that the current system is not sustainable. 
 The world is running out of arable soil. For years, farmers have used effective petroleum-based chemical pesticides in the form of neonicotinoids, pyrethroids, carbamates, and organophosphates. Over time, these non-targeted products can have unintended negative consequences, including damage to beneficial insects and plants, and they can linger in the environment for years, eroding soil quality and polluting water resources. 
 Using RNA, we can create targeted biocontrols for agriculture. Biology also offers a fundamental shift in how things are made and disposed of in a world where things grow and decay, creating circular, regenerative processes. Our goal is to have products that can help the environment, not harm it. GreenLight’s RNA is produced from materials using an enzymatic process and after application our RNA product candidates disappear in a few days. We believe that, because the active RNA ingredients in our product candidates quickly degrade in the environment, our product candidates will have the potential to be more sustainable, or greener, than traditional petroleum-based chemical pesticides. 
 We aim to provide farmers with safe-to-use, cost-effective, targeted biocontrols that stop pests while protecting crops, honeybees, and land before and after harvest. If we help farmers create greener, cleaner crops, they can provide consumers with the greener, cleaner foods they demand. Additionally, we also intend to provide farmers with safer products to handle, while helping farming families promote more sustainable land for future generations. 
 When we refer to a product or process as ‘green’ in the context of potential agricultural products, we are referring to the fact that dsRNA-based pesticides have the potential to leave little to no residue behind after use, resulting in a significant potential reduction in the toxins or other foreign matter released into local waterways, aquifers, or the food chain. Additionally, when we use the term ‘sustainable,’ we refer to our efforts to align economic development with environmental protection and human well-being as well as our anticipated obligations as a Public Benefit Corporation under § 362(a) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
 Social 
 Values and biases can be embedded in the technologies that are made, in the applications that are considered, and in the ways problems are addressed. Inclusion of those who have historically been left out of the development of new technologies is essential to building equitable and positive outcomes. GreenLight was born from a passion to make our world more sustainable and more equitable. Our vision is to enable Africa, Asia, and Latin America to meet local demand through local production. Our novel RNA manufacturing process—quick to start, built for scale, and using small bioreactors—may be part of the solution. 
 An ecosystem thrives with more diversity, and the inclusion of many different voices is essential to growing our company. Team members are empowered to bring their best ideas forward, and leaders are always open to listen and act. We challenge one another to discover breakthroughs that advance our science to deliver on a common cause: sustaining the planet, protecting our food, saving lives. With equity, diversity, and inclusion principles as the foundation, we are relentlessly focused on cultivating a team with diverse backgrounds and perspectives. We are always thinking about how we can better serve our colleagues of different genders, ethnicities, generations, educational achievement, sexual orientation, and workstyles. These values and initiatives are not just a top-down corporate statement; they are an intrinsic part of our culture. 
 Governance 
 At GreenLight, we celebrate the power of working together to address humanity’s challenges, meet the needs of underserved populations, and push the boundaries of scientific discovery. Our culture represents a team 
 
26 

  united by a common purpose of creating a more sustainable future by bringing food security, medicine, and healthcare to everyone. From the very beginning, our founders believed that our way forward would be based on equality, diversity, and inclusion (ED&I). These founding principles guide us every day as we identify, attract, retain, incentivize, and develop a highly talented workforce. 
 The following values are deeply coded within our business, mission, and culture: 
 

• | Care for everyone
--+------------------


• | Courage to achieve the impossible
--+----------------------------------


• | Collaboration to propel our success
--+------------------------------------


• | Commitment to science and doing the right thing, always
--+--------------------------------------------------------


Our culture is built on care, transparency, diversity, employee ownership and engagement, and a deep, humble respect for science. Transparency is essential to how we operate, to enable sharing of the insights and tools that enable our platform to grow, as well as to build trust and accountability with all our stakeholders. 
 We have selected independent directors and scientific advisory board members with decades of experience. Our board of directors and management team will leverage that experience and consider the interests of stockholders, customers, employees, suppliers, academic researchers, governments, communities, and other stakeholders to pursue long-term value for our company and drive the sustained health of our global community.

  COMPETITION 
 We are aware of only one large company, Bayer AG, that has human health and agricultural capabilities similar to our company. Other competitors split into either human health or agricultural market categories. 
 Human health 
 Our competitors are biotechnology companies working on indications similar to our pipeline, mRNA companies, large pharmaceutical companies, and academia. 
 We are aware of several large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as smaller, early-stage companies, pursuing the development of products and disease indications we are targeting. These include major vaccine and therapeutics companies such as Roche Holding AG, AbbVie, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Merck & Co Inc, Sanofi, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, and Novavax. 
 Among RNA specialist companies, BioNTech and Moderna already have COVID-19 vaccines on the market, while CureVac N.V., Arcturus Therapeutics Inc., Translate Bio, Daiichi Sankyo, Elixirgen Therapeutics, and Providence Therapeutics have clinical trials underway. Specialized therapeutics companies such as Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Editas Medicine, and Dicerna Pharmaceuticals also compete against GreenLight. 
 Agriculture 
 We believe that our technology platform coupled with our research and development expertise and commercial strategy set us apart from others in the food and agricultural market. Because crop protection is a mature industry, there are several companies targeting similar insects and fungi and investing in effective products. These include larger companies such as Syngenta and Bayer, as well as smaller companies such as Provivi, Vestaron, and Biotalys. Creating the sustainable food system we know is possible will require the expertise and dedication of many people bringing many new products to market. We look forward to collaborating with many companies, even those we have called out as competitors, to achieve that future. 
Platform 
 Our platform, and our ability to manufacture biological molecules, is a key competitive advantage and driver of future growth. Ginkgo Bioworks, Zymergen, and Codexis, among others, have sophisticated know-how and may emerge as competitors. 
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
 We strive to protect and enhance proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets to develop, strengthen, and maintain proprietary positions that may be important for the development of our business. We additionally may rely on regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity, and patent-term extensions, where available. 
 Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to: obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents and patent applications; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; maintain and defend our trademark registrations and applications; and operate without infringing the valid, enforceable patents and other intellectual property and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to limit third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing our products or using our proprietary methods may 
 
28 

  depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable licenses, patents, trademarks or trade secrets that cover these activities. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products or methods of manufacturing and using the same or that they will prevent others from commercializing competing products or technology. 
 Patents 
 As of March 22, 2022, we had approximately 40 patent families (the term “patent family” is used here to denote patents and applications claiming priority to a common patent application) in various fields of our business. Of those patent families, approximately seven families relate to RNA production; approximately six families relate to other human health-related technologies; approximately 17 families relate to crop protection and bee health; approximately three families relate to production of sugars; and approximately seven families relate to process control and compound production. The number of families may change if we file additional applications or obtain additional issued patents or if we abandon any of our pending or issued patents. We continue to evaluate the costs and potential benefits of patent protection in various jurisdictions. In connection with such evaluations, we may abandon pending applications or issued patents. 
 Individual patent terms extend for varying periods of time, depending on the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which patent applications are filed, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing of the first non-provisional application to which priority is claimed. Under certain circumstances, a patent term can be extended. For example, in the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term-adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in reviewing and granting a patent; by patent-term extension for certain patents covering products requiring regulatory approval prior to being sold or methods of using or making such products; or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country, and depends on many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
 Our seven RNA production patent families include four families directed to RNA production platforms. All four families, including all of the issued patents in such families, contain claims directed to methods of manufacture of RNA and/or related processes. One such platform family includes U.S. Patent No. 10,858,385, the issued claims of which protect certain aspects of our process for production of dsRNA. This family also includes a pending U.S. continuation and a number of foreign applications pending in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Costa Rica, the European Patent Office, Japan, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand, and Ukraine. The projected expiration for U.S. Patent No. 10,858,385 is in 2037, not including any term adjustments or extensions if applicable. 
 Another RNA production platform family contains U.S. Patent No. 10,954,541 along with a pending U.S. continuation, issued patents in India and Indonesia, and a number of foreign applications pending in jurisdictions including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Costa Rica, the European Patent Office, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, and Ukraine. The projected expiration for U.S. Patent No. 10,954,541 is in 2037, not including any term adjustments or extensions if applicable. 
 The third RNA production platform family contains U.S. Patent No. 11,274,284, along with a pending U.S. continuation, issued patents in China, Indonesia, Japan, and Singapore, and additional foreign applications pending in jurisdictions including the European Patent Office, Israel, India and South Korea. The projected 
 
29 

  expiration date for U.S. Patent No. 11,274,284 is in 2036, not including any term adjustments or extensions if applicable. 
 The fourth RNA production platform family relates to methods for production of mRNA that may have applicability to our next generation approach for such production. This family contains a United States application along with applications recently filed in a number of foreign jurisdictions, including, Australia, Canada, China, the European Patent Office, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, and South Africa. All applications in this family are national stage applications from International Application No. PCT/US2020/025824. If the U.S. patent application in this family were allowed, the projected expiration of the resultant patent would be in 2040, not including any term adjustments or extensions if applicable. 
 The RNA production families also contain patent applications directed to various improved compositions and processes. These include, for example, two families, each consisting of an international patent application related to plasmid templates for production of RNA products, proteins and enzymes of interest. If we were to file U.S. national stage patent applications from these international applications and any claims were to be allowed, they would have projected expiration dates in 2040 and 2041, not including any term adjustments or extensions if applicable. 
 Other Human Health Patent Families 
 We currently have six additional Human Health specific patent families. One family includes International Application No. PCT/US2021/042015 and a related U.S. patent application directed to compositions and methods of treatment related to our ongoing research in the field of gene therapy. If the U.S. patent application were to be allowed, the projected expiration of the resultant patent would be in 2041, not including any term adjustments or extensions if applicable. Two families each contain a pending United States provisional patent application related to the same research. Another of the families contains a U.S. provisional application directed to mRNA compositions, including the company’s proposed COVID vaccine. 
Bee Health and Crop Protection Families 
 Our 17 Bee Health and Crop Protection patent families include seven Bee Health patent families and ten Crop Protection patent families. 
 Bee Health Patent Families 
 Four of our Bee Health patent families contain claims directed to or related to our proposed varroa mite product and/or its use. The first such family is co-owned with Yissum and subject to an exclusive license to us of Yissum’s ownership interest in commercial rights to this patent family. For more information on this license, see “Item 1. Business—Intellectual Property Agreements — Bayer Acquisition Agreement.” This family consists of U.S. Patent Nos. 8,962,584, 9,662,348, and 10,801,028, which contain composition and method of treatment claims expected to expire in 2030, not including any term adjustments or extensions if applicable.

This family further comprises a pending U.S. continuation; foreign patents in China, Israel, and South Africa; and pending foreign applications in jurisdictions including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, European Patent Office, India, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Ukraine, Uruguay. 
 The fourth such Bee Health patent family contains a pending U.S. application, Serial No. 17/013,330 along with pending applications in Australia and New Zealand. If claims of the U.S. application were to be allowed, the resultant patent would have a projected expiration in 2040, not including any term adjustments or extensions if applicable. 
 Crop Protection Patent Families 
 We have ten Crop Protection patent families. Three such families relate to nucleic acid compositions for control of Colorado potato beetle. One of those three families includes U.S. Patent No. 11,142,768 (expected to expire in 2039, not including any term adjustments or extensions if applicable) with composition claims directed to Calantha, our proposed Colorado potato beetle product, along with two pending related U.S. applications, and pending foreign patent applications in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, European Patent Office, India, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, and Ukraine. Another of those three Colorado potato beetle patent families contains U.S. Patent No. 11,185,079, which has composition claims and an expected expiration in 2039 (not including any term adjustments or extensions if applicable), one pending related U.S. application, and pending foreign applications in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, European Patent Office, India, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, and Ukraine. The third such family has one pending U.S. patent application. 
 Our seven other Crop Protection patent families include: one family with a pending international patent application directed to compositions for controlling lepidopteran pests; one family with a pending U.S. patent application and an international patent application directed to compositions for control of a fungus; three provisional applications directed to compositions for control of lepidopteran pests; a provisional application directed to compositions for controlling fungi; and one provisional application directed to compositions for improved product stability. 
 Sugar Platform Patent Families 
 We have three patent families related to enzymatic production of sugars. One family consists of issued U.S. Patent Nos. 10,316,342, 10,577,635, and 10,704,067, all of which contain method of production claims and are expected to expire in 2038, not including any term adjustments or extensions if applicable. That family also consists of a pending U.S. continuation and foreign applications in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, European Patent Office, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Korea, and Thailand. 
 A second sugar platform family comprises United States and pending foreign applications in a number of jurisdictions recently filed as national stage entries of International Application No. PCT/US2019/067113. If the U.S. patent application in this family were to be allowed, the resultant patent claims would have a projected expiration in 2039, not including any patent term adjustments or extensions if applicable. 
 Our third family consists of a pending provisional patent application directed to improved compositions useful for production of sugars. 
 Trade secrets 
 GreenLight’s technology-related intellectual property that are not patent-protected are maintained as confidential information and trade secrets. We employ a variety of safeguards to protect our confidential information and trade secrets, including contractual arrangements that impose obligations of confidentiality and security, digital security measures, and physical security precautions. 
 
31 

  With respect to contractual arrangements, we protect our confidential and proprietary information by requiring our employees to execute nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon commencement of their employment. Agreements with our employees also bar them from using the proprietary rights of third parties in the course of their employment or disclosing to us any confidential information of third parties. 
 We require confidentiality and material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials, and we also incorporate confidentiality and material transfer precautions into our research and collaboration agreements. 
 We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems 
 Trademark and domain names 
 GreenLight owns 4 U.S. trademark applications relating to the GreenLight name and logo and the Calantha brand in the United States and other jurisdictions around the world. We are still evaluating whether we want to release some or all of our products under the GreenLight brand, or whether we want to develop new brands applicable to specific product pipelines. We also have a registered domain name for our website found at www.greenlightbiosciences.com. 
 Intellectual Property Agreements 
 Bayer Acquisition Agreement 
 We entered into an Assignment and License Agreement with and Bayer CropScience LLP (“Bayer”) dated December 10, 2020 (the “Bayer Acquisition Agreement”), pursuant to which we acquired from Bayer certain intellectual property rights related to (i) RNA technology used to control Varroa mites, Nosema, and bee viruses, which includes assignments of patents and a license to research, develop and sell methods and products in such field with the use of Bayer “know-how” with respect to such technology, and the assignment of Bayer’s rights under a license agreement with Yissum Research and Development Company of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem LTD (the “Yissum License”), and (ii) technology used to control the Colorado potato beetle and canola flea beetle, including a license to research, develop and sell methods and products in such field with the use of Bayer patents and “know-how” with respect to such technology. Under the Bayer Acquisition Agreement, we were obligated to make a closing payment to Bayer equal to $2,000,000 as well as certain milestone payments equal to up to $2,000,000 in the aggregate, in the event that certain regulatory approvals are achieved with respect to the aforementioned technologies. 
 We also agreed to indemnify Bayer against losses arising out of GreenLight’s recklessness, willful misconduct, violation of law or breaches of representations or warranties under the Bayer Acquisition Agreement or activities related to the use of intellectual property assigned to GreenLight thereunder. The Bayer Acquisition Agreement shall survive for so long as the assigned patents remain in effect; provided, that the parties do not terminate the Bayer Acquisition Agreement earlier in accordance with its terms. 
 Under the Bayer Acquisition Agreement, GreenLight was assigned Bayer’s rights and obligations under the Yissum License. Pursuant to the Yissum License, we were granted an exclusive, worldwide license to make use of the relevant technology to develop, manufacture, market, distribute, or sell covered products, including an exclusive, worldwide license under Yissum’s interest in any bee health patents jointly owned with GreenLight. Notwithstanding the exclusive license, Yissum retains the right to practice the jointly-owned patents in ways that will not result in competition with GreenLight, including the right of the Hebrew University of Israel (the “University”) to practice the inventions for the University’s own internal research and educational purposes, and to license other academic and not-for-profit research organizations to do the same, provided that no such license directly or indirectly harms our commercial interest in the relevant patents and products. 
 
32 

  We also have the right, but not the obligation, to prosecute in our own name and at our own expense any infringement of patents jointly owned with Yissum, but in making our decision whether to assert infringement, we must give consideration to the views of Yissum. In order to settle any such infringement suit, we must obtain the consent of Yissum. 
 Pursuant to the Yissum License, we agreed to pay Yissum a running royalty percentage in the low single digits on net sales of the licensed products. The License ends on a country-by-country basis upon the later of the date of expiration of the last valid licensed patent, the end of regulatory exclusivity for a product, or 20 years from the date of first sale. 
 Pursuant to the Yissum License, we are liable for any loss, injury or damage whatsoever caused to our employees or to any person acting on our behalf or to the employees of Yissum or to any person acting on our behalf or to any third party, by reason of GreenLight’s acts or omissions pursuant to the Yissum License or by reason of any use made by GreenLight of the licensed technology and products. Moreover, we will compensate, indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Yissum or any person acting on its behalf or any of its employees or the University or representatives of the University against any liability imposed upon them by GreenLight’s acts or omissions or which derive from GreenLight’s use, development, manufacture, marketing, sale or sublicensing of any product or licensed technology unless it has been determined by an adjudicator of last resort that that the particular damage, loss or expense was caused by a particular indemnitee’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. 
 Either party may terminate the Yissum License upon written notice in the event of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding of the other party. Yissum may terminate the license agreement if we do not commercialize products within a reasonable timeframe, with certain exceptions, if it provides written notice and we do not cure such failure within a certain timeframe; or if we have an uncured lapse in necessary insurance coverage; or if we unreasonably fail to respond to third-party claims against the patents or technology licensed under the Yissum License. 
 Patent expiration is a legal determination under the laws of each relevant jurisdiction worldwide. Third parties may review public patent filings and make their own determination as to patent expiration based on the available documents. The last to expire U.S. Patent under the Yissum License is expected to expire in 2031. 
 Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation 
 We entered into a Grant Agreement with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation dated July 20, 2020, as amended by that certain Amendment 1 to Grant Agreement dated May 25, 2021 (as amended, the “Gates Grant”) pursuant to which we were awarded a grant in the amount of $3,343,151, payable in milestone tranches, for research regarding treatment and curative therapies for sickle cell disease and/or durable suppression of HIV in developing countries. We utilize the Gates Grant funds to explore new, low cost capabilities for the in vivo functional cure of sickle cell disease as well as the durable suppression of HIV. In the event that GreenLight has materially breached the Grant Agreement, the Foundation may demand repayment of the Gates Grant funds. 
Acuitas Therapeutics 
 Development & Option Agreement 
 In August 2020, we and Acuitas entered into a development and option agreement, or the Acuitas Option Agreement. Under the Acuitas Option Agreement, the parties agreed to jointly develop certain products combining our RNA constructs with Acuitas’s LNPs. Each party granted the other party a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license under its proprietary technology to conduct the joint research. We pay Acuitas’s personnel costs and external expenses incurred in performing research in accordance with a work plan under the Acuitas Option Agreement. Under the Acuitas Option Agreement, Acuitas granted us options to 
 
33 

  obtain non-exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable licenses under Acuitas’s patent rights and know-how related to LNP technology, or Acuitas LNP Technology, with respect to three specified targets, or Reserved Targets, to develop and commercialize one or more therapeutic products incorporating Acuitas LNP Technology and our RNA constructs. We paid Acuitas a technology access fee of $750,000 at the outset of the Option Agreement. Thereafter, we are obligated to pay an annual technology maintenance fee of $250,000 for each option that has not been exercised and target reservation and maintenance fees of $100,000 per Reserved Target until such Reserved Target is removed from the Reserved Target list or until we exercise an option with respect to such Reserved Target. 
 On exercise of the first option, we were required to pay a $1.5 million option exercise fee after execution of the first non-exclusive license. On exercise of the second and third options, we are required to pay a $1.75 million and $2.75 million option exercise fee after execution of the second and third non-exclusive licenses, respectively. 
 Unless earlier terminated, the Acuitas Option Agreement will remain in effect until the first to occur of (1) all options are exercised, and (2) three years from the effective date, except that we can choose to extend the three-year term for an additional two years. Either party may terminate the Acuitas Option Agreement for an uncured material breach of the other party or upon the other party’s bankruptcy or a similar event. We may terminate the Acuitas Option Agreement at our convenience following written notice to Acuitas. To GreenLight’s knowledge, the last to expire U.S. patent under the Acuitas Option Agreement will expire in 2041 if the last filed relevant U.S. patent application currently identified by Acuitas is allowed. However, additional intellectual property, including patents, may still be added to the Acuitas Option Agreement or may not be known to us. Therefore the last to expire patent under that Option Agreement may change. Moreover, patent expiration is a legal determination under the laws of each relevant jurisdiction worldwide. Third parties may review public patent filings and make their own determination as to patent expiration based on the available documents. 
 Any jointly developed intellectual property under the Acuitas Option Agreement is jointly owned by the parties in an undivided one-half interest to such joint intellectual property. 
 Non-Exclusive License Agreement 
 In January 2021, we exercised the first option under the Acuitas Option Agreement and entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with Acuitas, or the Acuitas License Agreement. Acuitas granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under the Acuitas LNP Technology to research, develop, manufacture, and commercially exploit a vaccine product consisting of our RNA constructs and Acuitas’s LNPs. We paid Acuitas an option exercise fee of $1.5 million. Under the Acuitas License Agreement, we are required to pay Acuitas an annual license maintenance fee of $1 million until we achieve a particular development milestone. Acuitas is entitled to receive potential clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments of up to $17.25 million in the aggregate. With respect to the sale of each licensed product by us, our affiliates or our sublicensees, Acuitas is entitled to receive low single digit percentage royalties on net sales of the licensed product in a given country until the last to occur, in such country, of (i) the expiration of all licensed patent rights covering the licensed product, (ii) expiration of any regulatory exclusivity for the licensed product, or (iii) ten years from the first commercial sale of the licensed product, or Royalty Terms. We are entitled to certain royalty reductions and offsets with respect to each licensed product in a given country if no licensed patents cover the licensed product or if we are required to obtain rights to third party patents that relate to LNP technology. Unless earlier terminated, the Acuitas License Agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of the last-to-expire Royalty Term. Either party may terminate the Acuitas License Agreement for an uncured material breach of the other party or upon the other party’s bankruptcy or a similar event. We may terminate the Acuitas License Agreement at our convenience following written notice to Acuitas. 
 Additional intellectual property, including patents, may still be added to the Acuitas License Agreement or may not be known to us. Therefore the last to expire patent under that License Agreement may change. 
 
34 

  Moreover, patent expiration is a legal determination under the laws of each relevant jurisdiction worldwide. Third parties may review public patent filings and make their own determination as to patent expiration based on the available documents. To GreenLight’s knowledge the last to expire U.S. patent under the Acuitas License Agreement will expire in 2041 if the last filed relevant U.S. patent application currently identified by Acuitas is allowed. 
 GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
 We are using our RNA manufacturing platform to develop products for human health and agriculture, and we are subject to laws and regulations for those markets. These regulations currently apply to development and testing of our products and in the future will apply to manufacturing, import, export, marketing, and sale of products. 
 Human health products 
 We are developing human health products and gene therapies that include vaccines for COVID-19, shingles, influenza, and sickle cell anemia. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and biologics under the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”). Both drugs and biologics also are subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of drugs and biologics. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 U.S. biologics regulation 
 In the United States, biological products such as gene therapies and vaccines are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. The process required by the FDA before biologics may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
 

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice requirements (“GLPs”);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (“IND”), which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an institutional review board (“IRB”) or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application (“BLA”), after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



35 

 
  
• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with Good Clinical Practices (“GCPs”); and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must typically review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries. 
 For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
 

• | Phase 1—The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2—The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



36 

  
• | Phase 3—The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may also be made a condition to approval of the BLA. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 BLA submission and review by the FDA 
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by independent investigators. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies. 
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. Once a BLA has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after the filing date, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process may also be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may also convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional 
 
37 

  information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (CRL). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the CRL without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the CRL, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. 
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy implemented to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. 
 Expedited development and review programs 
 The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. For example, the fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing product candidates that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product candidate has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development and, once a BLA is submitted, the product candidate may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product candidate may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. 
 A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers. 
 
38 

  Any marketing application for a drug or biologic submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a fast track designation and/or breakthrough therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A BLA is eligible for priority review if the product candidate is designed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available alternatives for such disease or condition. For original BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (as compared to ten months under standard review). 
 Additionally, product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
 Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time-period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. 
 Post-approval requirements 
 Biologics are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
 

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



39 

  
• | fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | clinical holds on clinical studies;
--+------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. 
 Biosimilars and reference product exclusivity 
 The Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. 
 Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA. 
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the 
 
40 

 
 
  safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. 
 A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study. 
 Laboratory licensing and certification requirements 
 We are planning to partner with contract laboratories who are subject to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (“CLIA”), which requires all clinical laboratories to meet certain quality-assurance, quality-control, and personnel standards. 
 Agricultural products 
 We are developing insecticides and fungicides to protect crops and acaricides to protect honeybees that are beneficial to crops. In the United States, the development, testing, and commercialization of these products are regulated by the EPA through the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”), the Food Quality Protection Act (“FQPA”) and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”). 
 In general, FIFRA prohibits the sale or distribution of any pesticide, a product category that includes the insecticides, fungicides, and acaricides we are developing, unless that pesticide is registered with the EPA. To register a pesticide with the EPA, the applicant must demonstrate that the product will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment. These adverse effects include any unreasonable risk to man or the environment, taking into account the economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits of the use of the pesticide, as well as any human dietary risk from residues that result from use of the pesticide in or on any food consistent with the FFDCA. In the course of its evaluation of a pesticide, EPA assesses the impact that a pesticide may have on endangered species and non-target organisms. 
 Because our products contain novel RNA-based active ingredients, there will generally be no previously registered pesticide product containing that active ingredient and, as a result, the use of each of our products will require a new registration under FIFRA and the establishment of a tolerance under Section 408 of the FFDCA or the issuance of a tolerance exemption. 
 In order for the EPA to register a pesticide: 
 

• | the applicant must first conduct specified studies to evaluate mammalian toxicology, toxicological effects to non-target organisms in the environment (ecotoxicological exposures), and the product’s physical and chemical properties;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the applicant must then submit to the EPA a registration dossier that includes data demonstrating that the product does not pose unreasonable risks;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the EPA will conduct both scientific and administrative reviews of the dossier, including a thorough evaluation of submitted safety data and completion of risk assessments for human dietary and ecotoxicological exposures;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | if the EPA identifies any risks that appear to exceed regulatory standards or any other deficiencies in the dossier, it will ordinarily issue a letter identifying the deficiencies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the applicant will have one or more opportunities to address any deficiencies, including the submission of factors that mitigate any risks identified in the EPA’s risk assessments; this process may involve ongoing submissions and coordination with the EPA to address any unresolved concerns; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



41 

  
• | the EPA will undertake various stages of internal review prior to making a final decision on the application.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act, enacted in 1996 and subsequently renewed, can serve to reduce the data requirements and timeline related to regulatory approvals for biopesticides when compared to other pesticides, with EPA approvals typically received within 16 to 24 months, compared with 36 months or longer for conventional chemical pesticides. 
 As part of the pesticide registration process, the EPA under its FFDCA authority establishes tolerances for pesticide chemicals, which consist of limits on pesticide residues that may remain on feed or feed commodities. In some cases, the EPA may issue a tolerance exemption when the chemical will have no impact on human health. 
 Even if a FIFRA registration is granted, the EPA has the authority to revoke the registration or impose limitations on the use of any of our pest management products if we do not comply with the regulatory requirements, if unexpected problems occur with a product, or if the EPA receives other newly discovered adverse information. 
 In addition to the approval by the EPA, we are required to obtain regulatory approval from the appropriate regulatory authorities in individual states and foreign jurisdictions before we can market or sell any pest management product in those jurisdictions. In most U.S. states, local authorizations typically take one to three months after EPA approval. In other states, such as California, Arizona and New York, regulatory authorities require additional data specific to their respective jurisdictions, and the process for having a product approved or denied can last an additional two to three months, or longer, for these states. 
 Outside the United States, the registration process varies by jurisdiction and can take between 24 and 84 months to complete. In most instances, initial submissions to foreign regulatory authorities will not occur until after a U.S. registration has been secured. Moreover, foreign governments typically require up to two seasons of locally generated field efficacy data on crop/pest combinations before a product dossier can be submitted for review. For example, in the EU, we would need to obtain authorization under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, which sets forth rules for the authorization, sale, use, and control of plant protection products, in order to market our products, and regulators may seek to require our products to comply with maximum residue levels under Regulation (EC) NO 396/2005. 
 In some instances, California and Canada will conduct joint reviews with the EPA, which allows some pesticides to receive concurrent approvals in California, Canada and the United States. California and foreign jurisdictions also require us to submit product efficacy data. Historically, the EPA has not required the submission of product efficacy data, but may request it. 
 The microbial strains used in our agricultural manufacturing process are also regulated by the EPA under the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”). In some circumstances, TSCA requires entities to provide notice to the EPA prior to the manufacture or importation of new microorganisms, called a Microbial Commercial Activity Notice (“MCAN”). Persons intending to manufacture or import these microorganisms for commercial purposes in the United States must submit an MCAN to the EPA at least 90 days before such manufacture or importation. The EPA has 90 days to review the submission in order to determine whether the microorganism may present an unreasonable risk to human health or the environment. If the EPA makes that determination, the EPA may impose appropriate regulatory restrictions on the microorganism. 
 Finally, a number of our products may require registration or approval under various state regulatory programs, including those relating to fertilizers, auxiliary plant substances, soil amendments, beneficial substances and/or biostimulants.
