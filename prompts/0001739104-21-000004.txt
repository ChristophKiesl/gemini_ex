ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Founded in 1954 as part of Lilly, Elanco Animal Health Incorporated (Elanco Parent) and its subsidiaries (collectively, Elanco, the Company, we, us, or our) is a premier animal health company that innovates, develops, manufactures and markets products for pets and farm animals. Headquartered in Greenfield, Indiana, we are one of the largest animal health companies in the world, with pro forma combined revenue of Elanco and Bayer Animal Health of approximately $4.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding Bayer Animal Health, globally, we are #1 in medicinal feed additives, #2 in poultry, and #3 in other pharmaceuticals, which are mainly pet health therapeutics, measured by 2019 revenue, according to Vetnosis. We have one of the broadest portfolios of pet parasiticides in the pet health sector. We offer a diverse portfolio of approximately 190 brands that make us a trusted partner to veterinarians and farm animal producers in more than 90 countries.
Elanco Parent was formed in 2018, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lilly, to serve as the ultimate parent company of substantially all of the animal health businesses of Lilly.
On September 24, 2018, we completed our initial public offering (IPO), pursuant to which we issued and sold 19.8% of our total outstanding shares. On September 20, 2018, our common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol “ELAN.” On September 24, 2018, immediately preceding the completion of the IPO, Lilly transferred to us substantially all of its animal health businesses in exchange for (i) all of the net proceeds (approximately $1,659.7 million) we received from the sale of our common stock in the IPO, including the net proceeds we received as a result of the exercise in full of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares, (ii) all of the net proceeds (approximately $2,000 million) we received from the issuance of our senior notes; and (iii) all of the net proceeds ($498.6 million) we received from the entry into our term loan facility. In addition, immediately prior to the completion of the IPO, we entered into certain agreements with Lilly that provide a framework for our ongoing relationship with them. These transactions are collectively referred to herein as the Separation.
On February 8, 2019, Lilly announced an exchange offer whereby Lilly shareholders could exchange all or a portion of Lilly common stock for shares of Elanco common stock owned by Lilly. On that date, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-4 with the SEC in connection with that exchange offer. The disposition of Elanco shares was completed on March 11, 2019, and resulted in the full separation of Elanco along with the disposal of Lilly's entire ownership and voting interest in Elanco.
On August 1, 2020, we completed the previously announced acquisition of Bayer Animal Health in a cash and stock transaction. The initial purchase price of $6.9 billion, subject to working capital and customary purchase price adjustments, was funded by $5.2 billion in cash and 72.9 million in shares of Elanco common stock at a fair value of $1.7 billion. We funded the cash portion of the acquisition consideration with available cash, which included $4.3 billion of net proceeds raised in the borrowings under a term loan B facility established in connection with the acquisition. The discussion throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K incorporates the acquired Bayer Animal Health business unless otherwise noted. 
In connection with the acquisition we divested Osurnia™, Vecoxan™, and the U.S. rights to Capstar™, along with certain other immaterial assets. Additionally, we divested the European Economic Area and United Kingdom rights to the Drontal™ and Profender™ product families from Bayer Animal Health. The divestitures were completed during the third quarter of 2020 with gross cash proceeds from the sales of $434.7 million. Other immaterial Bayer Animal Health assets were divested during the first quarter of 2021.
We believe the acquisition expands our portfolio to provide farmers, pet owners, and veterinarians more comprehensive animal health solutions. By combining Elanco’s longstanding focus on the veterinarian with Bayer Animal Health’s direct-to-consumer experience, the transaction creates new opportunities for growth and expands our omni-channel presence, enabling us to meet customers where and how they want to shop. Our existing product portfolio is enhanced by the addition of Bayer Animal Health, which complements our commercial operations and international infrastructure, and our robust R&D pipeline is now strengthened with expected launch equivalents from Bayer Animal Health. Subsequent to the acquisition date, our consolidated and combined financial statements 

2020 Form 10-K | 6 

include the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of Bayer Animal Health. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6. Acquisitions and Divestitures” for additional information.
We continue to operate our business in a single segment directed at fulfilling our vision of enriching the lives of people through food, making protein more accessible and affordable, and through pet companionship, helping pets live longer, healthier lives. For additional information about our business segment, refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 18. Geographic Information.” During the third quarter of 2020, we renamed our four primary product categories by replacing "food animal" and "companion animal" with "farm animal" and "pet health," respectively, to better reflect the terminology used by our customers. We advance our vision by offering products in these four primary categories:

Pet Health Disease Prevention (PH Disease Prevention): We have one of the broadest parasiticide portfolios in the pet health sector based on indications, species and formulations, with products that protect pets from worms, fleas and ticks. Our Seresto™ and Advantage™, Advantix™, Advocate™ (collectively referred to as the Advantage Family) products represent treatments for the elimination and prevention, respectively, of fleas and ticks. Combining our parasiticide portfolio with our vaccines presence, we are a leader in the U.S. in the disease prevention category based on share of revenue. 
Pet Health Therapeutics (PH Therapeutics): We have a broad pain and osteoarthritis portfolio across species, modes of action, indications and disease stages. Pet owners are increasingly treating osteoarthritis in their pets, and our Galliprant™ product is one of the fastest growing osteoarthritis treatments in the U.S. We also have treatments for otitis (ear infections) with Claro™, as well as treatments for certain cardiovascular and dermatology indications. 
Farm Animal Future Protein & Health (FA Future Protein & Health): Our portfolio in this category, which includes vaccines, nutritional enzymes and animal-only antibiotics, serves the growing demand for protein and includes innovative products in poultry and aquaculture production, where demand for animal health products is outpacing overall industry growth. With our Maxiban™ product, we are a leader in the control and prevention of intestinal disease in poultry. We are focused on developing functional nutritional health products that promote farm animal health, including enzymes, probiotics and prebiotics. We are also a global leader in providing vaccines as alternatives to antibiotics to promote animal health based on share of revenue. 
Farm Animal Ruminants & Swine (FA Ruminants & Swine): We have a range of farm animal products, including Rumensin™ and Baytril™, used extensively in ruminant (e.g., cattle, sheep and goats) and swine production. 

Excluding Bayer Animal Health, we have a top four presence in all four key industry geographic regions: North America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA); Latin America (LATAM); and Asia-Pacific (APAC), as measured by 2019 revenue, according to Vetnosis. The following graphs illustrate our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 by product category and geography:
(1)Represents revenue from arrangements in which we act as a contract manufacturer, including supply agreements associated with divestitures of products related to the acquisition of Bayer Animal Health. This category was previously called Strategic Exits.
(2)LATAM includes aquaculture in all regions.

2020 Form 10-K | 7 

Through our global sales force comprised of approximately 2,210 sales representatives, our veterinary consultants and our key distributors, we seek to build strong customer relationships and fulfill demand for our farm animal products primarily with farm animal producers, veterinarians and nutritionists, and for our pet health products primarily with veterinarians and, in some markets, pet owners. We are also expanding into retail channels in order to meet pet owners where they want to purchase.
Our inclusive approach to sourcing innovation helps us identify, attract, fund and develop new ideas that enhance our pipeline and reduce risk as compared to an in-house only approach. Through this process we have launched or acquired 14 new products since 2015, including the additions of Entyce™, Nocita™ and Tanovea™ in 2019, that delivered $440.8 million of revenue in 2020. This excludes our most recent acquisition of Bayer Animal Health, which added approximately 65 products to the Elanco portfolio that contributed post-acquisition revenues of $591.9 million in 2020.
We believe we have an experienced leadership team that fosters an adaptive, purpose-driven culture among approximately 10,200 employees worldwide as of December 31, 2020 and that our employees share a deep conviction for achieving our vision of food and companionship enriching life.
A summary of our 2020, 2019, and 2018 revenue and net income is as follows:

 | Year Ended December 31,
(Millions of Dollars) | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018
Revenue | $ | 3,273.3 | | | $ | 3,071.0 | | $ | 3,066.8
Net income (loss) | (560.1) | | | 67.9 | | | 86.5

Products
We have a diverse portfolio of products marketed under approximately 190 brands, including products for both farm animals and pets.
Our farm animal products are designed to enable producers to keep animals healthy and deliver more food while using fewer resources. Our antibacterials, anticoccidials, vaccines and parasiticides aim to make food safer by preventing and controlling disease. We offer products and support to enhance the integrity of the food supply, while our productivity enhancers help make food more affordable and abundant by increasing the amount of meat or milk an animal can supply. Furthermore, our expertise and data analytics help our customers improve production efficiency and business performance. Farm animal products represented approximately 56% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Our pet health products help veterinarians better care for pets. We partner with pet owners and veterinarians for the purpose of providing a consistent flow of innovative and effective products and support. Our R&D focuses on products that prevent and treat disease, improve and extend quality of life and improve the type of care received by pets. We also partner closely with veterinarians to provide technical support and case management for our products. Pet health products represented approximately 42% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020.
We group our products into four principal categories:
PH Disease Prevention: includes parasiticides and vaccine products for canines and felines.
PH Therapeutics: includes products for the treatment of pain, osteoarthritis, otitis, cardiovascular and dermatology indications in canines and felines.
FA Future Protein & Health: includes vaccines, antibiotics, parasiticides and other products used in poultry and aquaculture production, as well as functional nutritional health products, including enzymes, probiotics and prebiotics.
FA Ruminants & Swine: includes vaccines, antibiotics, implants, parasiticides and other products used in ruminants and swine production, as well as certain other farm animal products.

2020 Form 10-K | 8 

A significantly smaller portion of our revenue but a fast growing area within our business is derived from other non-pharmaceutical products, such as nutritionals. These products are categorized within FA Future Protein & Health and include enzymes, probiotics, and prebiotics, which impact animal microbiomes and other dietary factors to reduce disease incidence, improve gut health and enhance feed digestibility.
Rumensin, our top selling product, contributed approximately 7%, 10%, and 11% of our revenue in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. No other product contributed 10% or more of our revenue. Our top five selling products, Rumensin, Trifexis™, Maxiban, Interceptor Plus and the aggregate Advantage Family, collectively contributed approximately 23% of our 2020 revenue. Our top 10 products, including Seresto, collectively contributed 37% of our 2020 revenue.
Set forth below is information regarding our principal products, which are defined as product lines and products that represented approximately 1% or more of our revenue in 2020. We used estimated pro forma 2020 revenues as the basis for acquired Bayer Animal Health products included below:

Antibiotics
Antimicrobial resistance in humans, or the risk that bacterial pathogens that cause infectious disease in humans evolve or otherwise emerge that are resistant to antibiotics or other antimicrobials, is a significant health concern, and animal agriculture can play a role in mitigating this risk. As a company dedicated to the health and well-being of animals, we seek to help veterinarians and farmers responsibly use antibiotics when treating animals. In our efforts to address antibiotic resistance while protecting animal health, we introduced a global antibiotic stewardship plan focused on increasing responsible antibiotic use; reducing the need for shared-class antibiotics; and replacing antibiotics with alternatives to help livestock producers treat and prevent animal disease. Antibiotics, used responsibly, along with good animal care practices, help enhance food safety and animal well-being.

2020 Form 10-K | 12 

There are two classes of antibiotics used in animal health:
Animal-only antibiotics and ionophores: Not all pathogens that cause disease in animals are infectious in humans, and accordingly animal-only antibiotics are not used in human medicine. Ionophores are a special class of animal-only antimicrobials uniquely developed only for use in animals. In Europe and certain other jurisdictions, ionophores are not currently classified as antibiotics. Because of their animal-only designation, mode of action, and spectrum of activity, their use is not considered to create the same risk of resistance in human pathogens.
Shared-class antibiotics: These are used in both humans and animals. Some antibiotics are used to treat infectious disease caused by pathogens that occur in both humans and animals. Of the 18 major antibiotic resistance threats that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracks, two are associated with infectious disease in animals. As part of our global antibiotic stewardship plan and in compliance with the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) guidance, shared-class antibiotics are labeled only for the treatment of an established need in animals and only with veterinarian oversight.
We have intentionally shifted away from shared-class antibiotics, and are focusing on animal-only antibiotics, as well as antibiotic-free solutions. In 2020, 12% of our revenue was from products classified as shared-class antibiotics (4% from sales in the U.S. and 8% from international sales), which is down from 16% in 2015. Revenue from animal-only antibiotics and ionophores represented 17% of our total revenue in 2020 (14% from ionophores), which is down from 23% in 2015. The decline in animal-only antibiotics is primarily a result of the inclusion of revenues from Bayer Animal Health products, which are disproportionately more pet health-focused than the existing legacy Elanco portfolio. Through our policies and efforts in this area, we seek to protect the benefits of antibiotics in human medicine, while responsibly protecting the health of farm animals and the safety of our food supply.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales organization includes sales representatives, veterinary consultants and other value added specialists. In markets where we do not have a direct commercial presence, we generally contract with distributors that provide logistics and sales and marketing support for our products. On a more limited basis, in certain markets, we sell certain products through retail and e-commerce channels. Our presence in these channels has been expanded by our acquisition of Bayer Animal Health. 
Our sales representatives visit our customers, including consultants, veterinarians, farm animal producers, and resellers, to inform, promote and sell our products and to support customers. Our veterinary consultants are available to provide scientific consulting focused on disease management and herd management, training and education on diverse topics, including responsible product use, and generally have advanced degrees in veterinary medicine, veterinary nutrition or other agriculture-related fields. These direct relationships with customers allow us to better understand their needs. Additionally, our sales representatives and veterinary consultants focus on collaborating with our customers to educate and support them on topics such as local disease awareness and to help them adopt new and more sophisticated animal health solutions, including through the use of our products. As a result of these relationships, our sales and consulting visits provide us with access to customer decision makers. In addition, our sales and marketing organization provides enhanced value by providing support to farm animal producers to help maximize their yields and reduce costs. Our analytics help customers analyze large amounts of health and production data. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 2,210 sales representatives.
Customers
We primarily sell our farm animal products to third-party distributors and directly to a diverse set of farm animal producers, including beef and dairy farmers as well as pork, poultry and aquaculture operations. We primarily sell our pet health products to third-party distributors, as well as directly to veterinarians who typically then sell our products to pet owners. With the acquisition of Bayer Animal Health, we have expanded our presence in retail and e-commerce channels in order to meet pet owners where they want to purchase. Certain principal pet health products acquired from Bayer Animal Health, including Seresto and the Advantage Family, are offered through these channels. Our largest customer, an affiliate of AmerisourceBergen Corp., is a third-party veterinary distributor and represented approximately 11% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our next two largest customers represented approximately 6% and 5% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. No other customer represented more than 5% of our revenue for the same period.

Research and Development
Our R&D organization is comprised of internal research, global development, global regulatory and external innovation collaborations and venture investing. As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 1,200 employees in our global R&D and Regulatory Affairs organizations. Our global R&D sites are comprised of the following:

Facilities | Co-located with Manufacturing Sites | Other R&D Operations
Greenfield, Indiana (R&D headquarters) | Fort Dodge, Iowa | Basel, Switzerland 
Kemps Creek, Australia | Shawnee, Kansas | Sao Paulo, Brazil 
Monheim, Germany | Cuxhaven, Germany | Shanghai, China 
 | Manukau, New Zealand | Bangalore, India 

Certain R&D sites will be impacted by restructuring and integration activities expected to occur over the next year as we implement initiatives to realize cost efficiencies from the Bayer Animal Health acquisition. 
We incurred R&D expenses of $327.0 million in 2020, $270.1 million in 2019 and $246.6 million in 2018.
New product innovation is a core part of our business strategy. Our R&D investment is focused on projects that target novel product introductions, as well as new indications, presentations, combinations and species expansion. Our approach is a build, buy, or ally strategy to develop compelling targets and concepts that originate from our scientists and innovators, academia, agribusiness, or human pharmaceutical and biotechnology at all stages of R&D. The ability to source our concepts from different areas allows us to create a pipeline that can be competitive in the categories in which we have chosen to compete, while reducing our risk by not owning and funding all aspects of our R&D projects.
We seek to concentrate our resources in areas where we believe the science and our capabilities best match the opportunities in the animal health market. Specifically, our R&D focuses on six areas across pets and farm animals. For pets, we have R&D activities in therapeutics, vaccines and parasiticides, while in farm animals we are pursuing pharmaceuticals, vaccines and nutritional health.
Our R&D efforts consist of more than 150 active programs balanced across species and technology platforms. For both farm animals and pets, we apply both large and small molecule approaches. In vaccines, our efforts encompass a full range of modified live, inactivated and nucleic acid strategies. In nutritional health, we focus on products based on enzymes, probiotics, prebiotics and other approaches that modulate biological activity in the animal digestive tract. Additionally, we employ various delivery strategies for products including in-feed, injectable, oral and topical formulations developed in conjunction with our manufacturing team to assure production that maximizes the capabilities within our internal and external manufacturing network.
We engage in licensing and business development to acquire assets for our pipeline and new R&D platforms and to establish strategic R&D collaborations. We make and maintain capital investments in venture capital vehicles that focus on agribusiness and animal health, and we engage in risk sharing collaborations to expand our external capital sources to augment internal investments. To support collaborations with innovation sources focused on human health we have developed capabilities to conduct translational comparative medical research trials in animals with naturally occurring conditions in animals that mimic a human disease or disorder. This type of collaboration de-risks unproven or less well-validated human hypotheses while potentially defining a clinically validated new approach in veterinary medicine.
Our R&D and commercial leadership allocate R&D investment annually with the goal of aligning near and long-term strategic opportunities and objectives. Portfolio investment decisions are made based on the probability of technical success and regulatory approval, timing of approval/launch and earlier milestones, feasibility and cost of development and manufacturing, intellectual property protection and market attractiveness/commercial forecast. R&D projects are supported by pharmaceutical project management approaches and we aim for all of our supporting R&D functional capabilities and capacities to be managed and matched to the evolving demands of the pipeline. We believe this overall R&D management system has enabled us to consistently gain product approvals while maintaining clear visibility to pipeline breadth and depth to support sustained launches into the future.

Manufacturing and Supply Chain
Our products are manufactured both at sites operated by us and sites operated by third-party contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs). We have a global manufacturing network of 20 sites comprised of the following:

International | | U.S. 
Barueri, Brazil | Kiel, Germany | Clinton, Indiana 
Belford Roxo, Brazil | Santa Clara, Mexico | Terre Haute, Indiana
Prince Edward Island, Canada | Manukau, New Zealand | Fort Dodge, Iowa 
Chengdu, China | Banwol, South Korea | Kansas City, Kansas 
Wusi, China | Chungli, Taiwan | Shawnee, Kansas 
Huningue, France | Speke, Liverpool, U.K. | Winslow, Maine 
Cuxhaven, Germany | Binh Duong, Vietnam | 

Manufacturing sites may be impacted by restructuring and integration activities expected to occur over the next year as we implement initiatives to realize cost efficiencies from the Bayer Animal Health acquisition.
Our global manufacturing and supply chain is also supported by a network of CMOs. As of December 31, 2020, this network was comprised of approximately 130 CMOs, including 50 relationships acquired from Bayer Animal Health. Our external manufacturing network centrally governs our global CMO relationships and provides oversight to these CMOs.
We select CMOs based on several factors: (i) their ability to reliably supply products or materials that meet our quality standards at an optimized cost; (ii) their access to specialty products and technologies; (iii) capacity; (iv) financial analyses; and (v) local presence. Our External Manufacturing Network seeks to ensure that all the CMOs we use adhere to our standards of manufacturing quality.
We purchase certain raw materials necessary for the commercial production of our products from a variety of third-party suppliers. We utilize logistics service providers as a part of our global supply chain, primarily for shipping and logistics support.
We intend to continue our efficiency improvement programs in our manufacturing and supply chain organization. We have strong globally managed and coordinated quality control and quality assurance programs in place at all internal manufacturing sites and external manufacturing hubs, and we regularly inspect and audit our internal sites and CMO locations.

We face intense competition. Principal methods of competition vary depending on the particular region, species, product category, or individual product. Some of these methods include new product development, quality, price, service and promotion.
Our primary competitors include animal health medicines and vaccines companies such as Zoetis Inc.; Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc., the animal health division of Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH; and Merck Animal Health, the animal health division of Merck & Co., Inc. We also face competition globally from manufacturers of generic drugs, as well as from producers of nutritional health products, such as DSM Nutritional Products AG and Danisco Animal Nutrition, the animal health division of E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, a subsidiary of DowDuPont, Inc. There are also several new start-up companies working in the animal health area. In addition, we compete with numerous other producers of animal health products throughout the world.
Intellectual Property
Our technology, brands and other intellectual property are important elements of our business. We rely on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as regulatory exclusivity periods and non-disclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. Our policy is to vigorously protect, enforce and defend our rights to our intellectual property, as appropriate.

Our product portfolio and certain product candidates enjoy the protection of approximately 6,500 patents and applications, filed in over 90 countries, with concentration in our major markets as well as other markets with strong patent systems, such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe, Japan and the U.S. Many of the patents and patent applications in our portfolio are the result of our own work, while other patents and patent applications in our portfolio were at least partially developed, and licensed to us, by third parties. A subset of our current products or product candidates are covered by patents and patent applications in our portfolio.
Patents for individual products expire at different times based on the date of the patent filing (or sometimes the date of patent grant) and the legal term of patents in the countries where such patents are obtained. Below is a summary of our recent and upcoming key patent expirations:
•Galliprant’s active ingredient, grapiprant, is encompassed by both compound and physical form patents in the U.S., Europe, Canada and other key markets, with terms that expire between October 2021 and March 2026. 
•Various formulation and method of use patents encompass the spinosad pesticide products, Comfortis and Trifexis. The Comfortis formulation patent extended through August 2020 in the U.S., Canada and Australia, and, upon grant of applicable supplementing protection certificate (SPC), through August 2025 in Europe. At this time, there is no indication of market entry of a generic version of Comfortis in the U.S., Canada or Australia. The Trifexis formulation and method of use patents extend through September 2021 in the U.S., Canada and Australia, and, upon grant of applicable SPC, through September 2026 in Europe. 
•The Seresto formulation patent will expire in the U.S. in September 2027. In Europe, the formulation patents will expire in June 2025, but in some countries, including Spain and the U.K., SPCs have been granted which expire in September 2026.
•Advantage Family products, acquired from Bayer Animal Health, are off-patent in most countries. If our customers increase their use of new or existing generic product alternatives, Advantage Family revenues could be adversely affected.
We typically maintain all of our patents and assert our patent rights against third parties as appropriate.
Additionally, many of our vaccine products, including the Duramune family of vaccines, are based on proprietary or patented master seeds and formulations. We actively seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, through a variety of means including by seeking to require our employees, consultants, advisors and partners to enter into confidentiality agreements and other arrangements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement.
In order to facilitate the Separation and allow Lilly's and our operations to continue with minimal interruption, Lilly licensed to us the right to use certain intellectual property rights in the animal health field. In addition, Lilly granted us a transitional license to use certain of Lilly’s trademarks for a period of time following the IPO. 
We seek to file and maintain trademarks around the world based on commercial activities in most regions where we have, or desire to have, a business presence for a particular product. We currently maintain more than 15,000 trademark applications and registrations in major regions, primarily identifying products dedicated to the care of livestock and pets.
Regulatory
The sale of animal health products is governed by the laws and regulations specific to each country in which we sell our products. To maintain compliance with these regulatory requirements, we have established processes, systems and dedicated resources with end-to-end involvement from product concept to launch and maintenance in the market. Our regulatory function actively seeks to engage in dialogue with various global agencies regarding their policies that relate to animal health products. In the majority of our markets, the relevant health authority is separate from those governing human medicinal products.
United States
U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The regulatory body that is responsible for the regulation of animal health pharmaceuticals in the U.S. is the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM), a division of the FDA. All manufacturers of 

2020 Form 10-K | 16 

animal health pharmaceuticals must demonstrate their products to be safe, effective and produced by a consistent method of manufacture as defined under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). The FDA’s basis for approving a new animal drug application is documented in a Freedom of Information Summary. Post-approval monitoring of products is required by law, with reports being provided to the CVM’s Office of Surveillance and Compliance. Reports of product quality defects, adverse events or unexpected results are maintained and submitted in accordance with the law. Additionally, as part of the drug experience report, we are required to submit all new information pertaining to the safety or effectiveness of a product, regardless of the source.
U.S. Department of Agriculture. The regulatory body in the U.S. for veterinary biologicals is the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The Center for Veterinary Biologics within the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in the USDA is responsible for the regulation of animal health biologicals, which includes but is not limited to vaccines, bacterins, allergens, antibodies, antitoxins, toxoids, immunostimulants, certain cytokines, antigenic or immunizing components of live microorganisms, and diagnostic components of natural or synthetic origin, or that are derived from synthesizing or altering various substances or components of substances such as microorganisms, genes or genetic sequences, carbohydrates, proteins, antigens, allergens or antibodies. All manufacturers of animal health biologicals must show their products to be pure, safe, effective and produced by a consistent method of manufacture as defined under the Virus Serum Toxin Act. Post-approval monitoring of products is required. Reports of product quality defects, adverse events or unexpected results are maintained and submitted in accordance with the agency requirements.
Environmental Protection Agency. The main regulatory body in the U.S. for veterinary pesticides is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA’s Office of Pesticide Programs is responsible for the regulation of most pesticide products applied to animals in accordance with a memorandum of understanding between the FDA and EPA for products that are subject to regulation under both the FFDCA and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. All manufacturers of animal health pesticides must show their products will not cause unreasonable adverse effects to man or the environment as stated in the act. Within the U.S., individual state pesticide authorities must, before distribution in that state, also approve pesticide products that are approved by the EPA. Post-approval monitoring of products is required, with reports provided to the EPA and some state regulatory agencies.
Food Safety Inspection Service. The FDA is authorized to determine the safety of substances (including “generally recognized as safe” substances, food additives and color additives), as well as prescribe their safe conditions of use. However, although the FDA has the responsibility for determining the safety of substances, the Food Safety and Inspection Service, the public health agency in the USDA, still retains, under the tenets of the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Poultry Products Inspection Act and their implementing regulations, the authority to determine that new substances and new uses of previously approved substances are suitable for use in meat and poultry products.
International
European Union (EU). We are governed by the following EU regulatory bodies:
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is a centralized agency of the EU responsible for the scientific evaluation of Veterinary Medicinal Products (VMP) developed by pharmaceutical companies for use in the EU. The agency has a veterinary review section distinct from the medical review section for human products. The Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products (CVMP) is responsible for scientific review of the submissions for VMP and Immunological Veterinary Medicinal Products. If the CVMP concludes that all requirements for quality, safety and efficacy are met, it issues a positive opinion that is forwarded to the European Commission, who takes the final decision following the European comitology procedure. The centralized marketing authorization (commission decision) of the European Commission is valid in all of the EU. All countries that are not part of the EU but belong to the European Economic Area (EEA), i.e., Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, have been part of the scientific assessment done by the CVMP. These countries issue a national marketing approval in accordance with the Commission decision. A series of regulations, directives, guidelines, EU Pharmacopeia Monographs and other legislation provide the requirements for approval in the EU. In general, these requirements are similar to those in the U.S., requiring demonstrated evidence of purity, safety, efficacy and consistency of manufacturing processes.
If approval is sought for products that either cannot or do not need to follow the centralized procedure, approval can also be achieved by national approval in an EEA country agency. This national authorization 

2020 Form 10-K | 17 

can be mutually recognized by other EEA countries/EU member states (Mutual Recognition Procedure). In addition, national and mutual recognition can be done in a combined procedure (Decentralized Procedure).
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is the agency of the EU that provides scientific advice and communicates with respect to existing and emerging risks associated with the food chain. Based on EFSA’s mandate, the agency evaluates applications for feed additives, including enzymes and several nutritionals for animals.
The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) is the agency of the EU for the safe use of chemicals. Based on the ECHA’s mandate, the agency conducts the evaluation of biocides for the EU.
With regard to Brexit, the U.K. formally left the EU on January 31, 2020. A transition period was in effect from February 1, 2020 until December 31, 2020, during which the U.K. and the EU would negotiate a trade agreement. On December 24, 2020, the EU and U.K. agreed to a trade deal with regulatory and customs cooperation mechanisms, no tariffs/quotas on products, as well as certain provisions ensuring open and fair competition. Post-separation, the U.K. has indicated it will look to continue working closely with the EMA, and that existing agreements between the EMA and other countries such as Switzerland, the U.S. and Canada provide a precedent on which the U.K. could build. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the agreed Brexit trade deal will have on our business, particularly our U.K. and other European operations; however, Brexit and its related effects could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated and combined financial statements.
Brazil. The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock Production and Supply (MAPA) is the regulatory body in Brazil that is responsible for the regulation and control of pharmaceuticals, biologicals and medicinal feed additives for animal use. MAPA’s regulatory activities are conducted through the Secretary of Agricultural Defense and its Livestock Products Inspection Department. In addition, regulatory activities are conducted at a local level through the Federal Agriculture Superintendence. These activities include the inspection and licensing of both manufacturing and commercial establishments for veterinary products, as well as the submission, review and approval of pharmaceuticals, biologicals and medicinal feed additives. MAPA is one of the most active regulatory agencies in Latin America, having permanent seats at several international animal health forums, such as Codex Alimentarius, World Organization for Animal Health and Committee of Veterinary Medicines for the Americas. MAPA was also recently invited to be a Latin American representative at International Cooperation on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Veterinary Medicinal Products (VICH) meetings. Several normative instructions issued by MAPA have set regulatory trends in Latin America.
Japan. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery (MAFF) is the regulatory body in Japan that is responsible for the regulation and control of pharmaceuticals (including biologicals and pesticide/disinfectant) and feed additive/feed for animal use. MAFF’s regulatory activities are conducted through the Livestock & Aquaculture Product Safety Control Division under Consumer Safety Bureau. The animal drug reviews and approvals, reexamination reviews, GxP compliance checks, GxP site inspections and product assay checks (including vaccine national assays) are done by National Veterinary Assay Laboratory (NVAL). MAFF coordinates with other agencies such as Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) and Food Safety Commission (FSC) to perform various license compliance checks (e.g. marketing authorization holder, manufacturer and oversea site accreditation) and ensure good promotional activities. Routine inspections, antimicrobial feed additive national assays and manufacturing inspections are done by the Food & Agriculture Material Inspection Center. For farm animal products, animal drug review is done by NVAL but the human food safety review is done by FSC (ADI establishment and antimicrobial risk assessment) and MHLW (MRL establishment). These three agencies (NVAL, FSC and MHLW) work together to approve farm animal products. In addition to those central government agencies, various licenses are delegated to the local municipal government, such as animal drug wholesaler and retailer licenses and feed additive distributor licenses.
China. The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) is the regulatory body that is responsible for the regulation and control of pharmaceuticals, biologicals, disinfectants, medicinal feed additives, pesticide and feed/feed additives for animal use. There are three organizations under the MOA that regulate animal health:
The Institute of Veterinary Drug Control is responsible for the evaluation of new applications, renewals, variations, manufacturers, quality methods and tissue residue methods for pharmaceuticals, biologicals, disinfectants and medicinal feed additives.
The feed/feed additive office is responsible for the registration and renewal of feed and feed additives.

2020 Form 10-K | 18 

The pesticide bureau is responsible for the registration and renewal of pesticide products.
Australia. The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) is an Australian government statutory authority established in 1993 to centralize the registration of all agricultural and veterinary products into the Australian marketplace. Previously, each state and territory government had its own system of registration. The APVMA assesses applications from companies and individuals seeking registration so they can supply their product to the marketplace. Applications undergo rigorous assessment using the expertise of the APVMA’s scientific staff and drawing on the technical knowledge of other relevant scientific organizations, Commonwealth government departments and state agriculture departments. If the product works as intended and the scientific data confirms that when used as directed on the product label it will have no harmful or unintended effects on people, animals, the environment or international trade, the APVMA will register the product. As well as registering new agricultural and veterinary products, the APVMA reviews older products that have been on the market for a substantial period of time to ensure they still do the job users expect and are safe to use. The APVMA also reviews registered products when particular concerns are raised about their safety and effectiveness. The review of a product may result in confirmation of its registration or it may see registration continue with some changes to the way the product can be used. In some cases, the review may result in the registration of a product being cancelled and the product taken off the market.
Rest of World. Country-specific regulatory laws typically have provisions that include requirements for certain labeling, safety, efficacy and manufacturers’ quality control procedures (to assure the consistency of the products), as well as company records and reports. Other countries’ regulatory agencies typically either refer to the FDA, USDA, EU and other international animal health entities, including the World Organization for Animal Health, Codex Alimentarius or VICH (see below), in establishing standards and regulations for veterinary pharmaceuticals and vaccines, or review the quality, safety and effectiveness of the products themselves according to their own national requirements.
Global Policy and Guidance
Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives. The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives is an international expert scientific committee that is administered jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO). They provide a risk assessment/safety evaluation of residues of veterinary drugs in animal products, exposure and residue definition and maximum residue limit proposals for veterinary drugs. Similarly, the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR) is an international expert scientific group administered jointly by the FAO and WHO. JMPR reviews residues and analytical aspects of the pesticides, estimate the maximum residue levels, review toxicological data and estimate acceptable daily intakes for humans of the pesticides under consideration. Elanco works with these committees to establish acceptable safe levels of residual product in food-producing animals after treatment with veterinary drugs or pesticides. This in turn enables the calculation of appropriate withdrawal times for our products prior to an animal entering the food chain.
Advertising and Promotion Review. Promotion of ethical animal health products is controlled by regulations in many countries. These rules generally restrict advertising and promotion to those claims and uses that have been reviewed and endorsed by the applicable agency. We conduct a review of promotion material for compliance with the local and regional requirements in the markets where we sell animal health products.
Import and Export of Products. The importation and exportation of animal health products is controlled by regulations in many countries. In some jurisdictions this may include obtaining separate permits or licenses by product or by company or filing notices with applicable regulatory agencies prior to import or export of product. We ensure compliance with local and global regulations in the markets where we import/export our animal health products.
International Cooperation on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Veterinary Medicinal Products. VICH is a trilateral (EU-Japan-USA) program launched in 1996 aimed at harmonizing technical requirements for veterinary product registration. Several other countries have obtained observer status, for example, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and South Africa, or are linked to VICH on basis of the VICH Outreach Forum, a VICH initiative with the main objective of providing a basis for wider international harmonization of technical requirements. In addition, the World Organization for Animal Health is an associate member of VICH.

Human Capital
As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 9,400 full time employees. In addition, we employed approximately 800 fixed-duration employees, which are individuals hired for a pre-defined length of time (one to four years). Together, they total approximately 10,200 employees worldwide. Of the 10,200 global employees, approximately 3,200 are U.S.-based and approximately 7,000 are employed in other jurisdictions. Some of these employees are members of unions, works councils, trade associations or are otherwise subject to collective bargaining agreements, including approximately 140 union employees in the U.S. located at our Fort Dodge, Iowa manufacturing/R&D facility. Approximately 35% of our global population is in customer-facing roles, including but not limited to traditional sales roles, technical consultants, account managers and commercial and general managers. 
The safety of employees, customers and suppliers with whom we frequently interact was our highest priority as COVID-19 spread across the globe. To limit exposure, we substantially restricted travel, required social distancing and supplied personal protective equipment to our workers who, as essential workers because the animal health industry has been designated an essential business, continued to be physically present in our manufacturing and research facilities while requiring non-essential employees to work remotely whenever possible. In 2020, our employees demonstrated resiliency, agility and engagement in support of business continuity despite the challenges that arose during the COVID-19 pandemic.
At Elanco, we are committed to fostering an inclusive culture where employees can make a difference, encouraging ownership, growth, and well-being. The following gives an overview of our approach to managing human capital resources.
Our Culture. We commit to create a culture built on the foundation of three values and four behavioral pillars:
Values that Guide our Decisions:
Integrity - Do the right thing in the right way.
Respect - Respect people, our customers and the animals in their care.
Excellence - Be accountable. Continuously improve. Deliver with discipline.
Behavioral Pillars that Guide our Actions:
Involve - We seek participation and input to gain commitment and passionate performance and create an engaged community. We act with humility as One Elanco, collaborating for the best outcomes for the entire company.
Deliver - We focus on the essential, build mastery, and diligently deliver on our commitments to our colleagues, customers, and shareholders.
Own - We are accountable and empowered. We ask questions and raise concerns. We are fully invested in Elanco's success.
Innovate - We bring an innovative mindset that drives continuous improvement of our processes, products, and services.
Our employees are driven by these values and behavioral pillars. At Elanco, this culture drives employee performance. Leadership and employees are encouraged to evaluate performance with these values and behavioral pillars in mind. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. We are focused on discovering new ways in which healthier animals can solve the world’s greatest health and environmental challenges, and this innovation is only possible through an inclusive culture of employees with diverse backgrounds, strengths, and perspectives. Diversity, equity and inclusion are critical to creating and maintaining our purpose-driven culture and strengthening our promises to our employees and customers.
Formed in 2015, our Global Elanco Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council (EDEIC) serves as a catalyst for a culture where diversity, equity and inclusion are embraced and recognized as a business-result driver. Within this 

2020 Form 10-K | 20 

framework, employee development is better supported, opinions and diverse backgrounds are embraced, and we are a stronger company. Current EDEIC focus areas include our Be You! Seminar series to raise awareness and provide a forum for an open discussion on the importance of a diverse and inclusive workplace at Elanco, strong Employee Resource Groups, an annual Multi-Cultural Summit, and aspirational goals for representation of women (globally) and minority group members (U.S.) in leadership. In addition, a clear direction has been established for the post COVID-19 pandemic “future of work” that will enable greater flexibility and access to more diverse talent in a wider range of locations.
Total Rewards. We invest in our workforce by offering competitive salaries, incentives, and benefits. Our pay for performance philosophy is designed to create ownership and ensure that we reward and recognize top-performing employees through merit increases and other rewards. We benchmark our total rewards annually to ensure our compensation and benefit programs remain competitive with our peers. Our benefits are one way we support our employees’ well-being and live up to our employee promise. 
Development. We offer our employees opportunities to advance their careers at Elanco and are passionate about equipping employees with skills and development opportunities to help them thrive and continually meet the ever-changing needs of our customers and other stakeholders in a dynamic and growing industry. 
Beyond professional growth and development, Elanco employees actively engage in Elanco's Healthy Purpose,™ which is our initiative to advance the well-being of animals, people and the planet, enabling us to realize our vision of "Food and Companionship Enriching Life." This vision is built on a fundamental belief uniting the purpose of all Elanco employees – healthier animals are the key to solving some of the world’s most pressing issues. Our 2020 Annual Voice of the Employee Survey found that more than 80 percent of employees feel a personal commitment to Elanco’s corporate responsibility goals of improving food security and supporting the human-animal bond. Since 2014, our employees have engaged in more than 855 global volunteer projects and more than 95,000 employee volunteer hours have been logged in support of cause-related projects and disaster relief efforts.
Environmental, Health and Safety
We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety (EHS) laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern matters such as the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air or water; the generation, use, storage, handling, treatment, packaging, transportation, exposure to, and disposal of hazardous and biological materials, including recordkeeping, reporting and registration requirements; and the health and safety of our employees. Due to our operations, these laws and regulations also require us to obtain, and comply with, permits, registrations or other authorizations issued by governmental authorities. These authorities can modify or revoke our permits, registrations or other authorizations and can enforce compliance through fines and injunctions.
Certain environmental laws impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault, for cleanup costs on persons who have disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment, including at third-party sites or offsite disposal locations, or that currently own or operate (or formerly owned or operated) sites where such a release occurred. We could be subject to liability for the investigation and remediation of legacy environmental contamination caused by historical industrial activity at sites that we own or on which we operate. In addition to clean-up actions brought by federal, state, local and foreign governmental entities, private parties could raise personal injury or other claims against us due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous materials on, from or otherwise relating to such a property.
We have made, and intend to continue to make, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable EHS laws and regulations. We are also monitoring and investigating environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites. As a result, we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2020 for environmental compliance purposes and for the clean-up of certain past industrial activities. Environmental-related capital expenditures and other environmental-related expenditures were $0.0 million and $0.4 million in 2020, respectively. 
In connection with past divestitures, we have undertaken certain indemnification obligations that may require us in the future, to conduct or finance environmental cleanups at sites that we no longer own or operate. In connection with certain of our acquisitions, we have also entered into indemnification agreements pursuant which we are or 

2020 Form 10-K | 21 

may be indemnified for various environmental cleanups; however, such indemnities are limited in both time and scope and may be further limited in the presence of new information, or may not be available at all.
