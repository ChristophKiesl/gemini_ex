ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We were a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this report as our initial business combination.
 
In June 2017, our sponsor acquired all 100 shares of our outstanding common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $250.00 per share. Prior to the initial investment in the company of $25,000, the company had no assets, tangible or intangible. The per share price for the founder shares was determined by dividing the amount initially contributed to the company by the number of founder shares issued. In October 2018, our sponsor sold certain of the founder shares to our three independent directors. On November 14, 2018 and November 15, 2018, we effected the Recapitalization and the Forfeiture (as described in Note 5 of the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K), respectively, and, as a result, our sponsor and independent directors held 5,750,000 founder shares (up to 750,000 of which were subject to forfeiture depending on the extent to which the underwriters’ option to purchase additional units was exercised, if at all). The number of founder shares issued in the Recapitalization and forfeited in the Forfeiture was determined based on the expectation that the total size of our initial public offering would be a maximum of 23,000,000 units if the underwriters’ option to purchase additional units was exercised in full, and therefore that such founder shares would represent 20% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock after our initial public offering (not including the shares of Class A common stock underlying the private placement units). On January 4, 2019, our sponsor forfeited 750,000 founder shares to us at no cost, in connection with the expiration of the underwriters’ over-allotment option.
 
The registration statement for our initial public offering was declared effective on November 15, 2018. On November 20, 2018, we completed our initial public offering of 20,000,000 units sold to the public at the price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $200,000,000. Each unit consisted of one share of our Class A common stock, $0.0001 par value and one warrant, each warrant exercisable to purchase one share of our Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50, pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-1, as amended (File No. 333-228018). The underwriters were granted a 45-day option to purchase up to 3,000,000 additional units to cover over-allotments, if any, at $10.00 per unit, less underwriting discounts and commissions. The over-allotment option was not exercised prior to its expiration on December 30, 2018.
 
Simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering, we completed a private placement of an aggregate of 250,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit and 3,500,000 warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant, generating total gross proceeds of $6,000,000. A total of $200,000,000 (including approximately $7,000,000 in deferred underwriting commissions payable to the underwriters) of the net proceeds from our initial public offering and the private placement was deposited in a trust account located in the United States established for the benefit of the company’s public stockholders with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee.
 
Our units began trading on November 16, 2018 on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “BWMCU.” Commencing on January 17, 2019, the common stock and warrants comprising the units began separate trading on Nasdaq under the symbols “BWMC” and “BWMCW,” respectively.
 
On August 12, 2019, Boxwood Merger Corp. (“Boxwood”), Atlas TC Holdings LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Boxwood and a Delaware limited liability company (“Holdings”), and Atlas TC Buyer LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings and a Delaware limited liability company (the “Buyer”), entered into a unit purchase agreement (as amended, the “Purchase Agreement”) with Atlas Intermediate Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Atlas Intermediate”) and Atlas Technical Consultants Holdings LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Seller”), pursuant to which the Buyer would acquire from the Seller all of the equity interests in Atlas Intermediate (the “Atlas Intermediate Units”). The acquisition of the Atlas Intermediate Units and the other transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement are collectively referred to herein as the “business combination.”
 
Recent Developments
 
On February 14, 2020, we consummated the business combination (the “Closing”). Following the Closing, the combined company is organized in an “Up-C” structure in which the business of Atlas Intermediate and its subsidiaries is held by Holdings and continues to operate through the subsidiaries of Atlas Intermediate, and in which our only direct assets consist of common units of Holdings (“Holdings Units”). We are the sole manager of Holdings in accordance with the terms of the amended and restated limited liability company agreement of Holdings (the “Holdings LLC Agreement”) entered into in connection with the consummation of the business combination.

Following the completion of the business combination, the Seller and its limited partners (the “Continuing Members”) owned an aggregate of 23,974,368 Holdings Units redeemable on a one-for-one basis for shares of Class A common stock. Upon the redemption by any Continuing Member of Holdings Units for shares of Class A common stock, a corresponding number of shares of our Class B common stock held by such Continuing Member will be cancelled. Following the conversion of each outstanding share of our Class F common stock to one share of Class A common stock, the sponsor owned an aggregate 2,225,000 shares of Class A common stock and 3,750,000 private placement warrants.
 
In connection with the Closing, all of our units separated into their component parts of one share of Class A common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of Class A common stock of the company, and the units ceased trading on Nasdaq. Following the Closing, our Class A common stock and warrants will continue to be listed on Nasdaq under the new trading symbols of “ATCX” and “ATCXW,” respectively.
