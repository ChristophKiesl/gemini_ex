Item 1.  Business
General
Pool Corporation (the Company, which may be referred to as we, us or our) is the world’s largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies, equipment and related leisure products and is one of the top three distributors of irrigation and landscape products in the United States.  The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1993 and has grown from a regional distributor to a multi-national, multi-network distribution company. 
Our industry is highly fragmented, and as such, we add considerable value to the industry by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and then distributing the products to our customer base on conditions that are more favorable than our customers could obtain on their own.
As of December 31, 2016, we operated 344 sales centers in North America, Europe, South America and Australia through our four distribution networks:

• | SCP Distributors (SCP);


• | Superior Pool Products (Superior);


• | Horizon Distributors (Horizon); and


• | National Pool Tile (NPT).

Beginning in 2014, we identified NPT as a separate distribution network. Through this network, we sell specialized products under the NPT brand including tile, decking materials and interior pool finishes, as well as hardscape and natural stone products. Please refer to our “Business Strategy and Growth” section below for more detailed information regarding the development of our NPT distribution network.
Superior and Horizon are both wholly owned subsidiaries of SCP, which is wholly owned by Pool Corporation. 
Our Industry
We believe that the swimming pool industry is relatively young, with room for continued growth from the increased penetration of new pools. Of the approximately 80 million homes in the United States that have the economic capacity and the yard space to have a swimming pool, approximately 11% currently have a pool. Significant growth opportunities also reside with pool remodel and pool equipment replacement activities due to the aging of the installed base of swimming pools, technological advancements and the development of energy-efficient products. The irrigation and landscape industry shares many characteristics with the pool industry, and we believe that it will realize long-term growth rates similar to the pool industry. As irrigation system installations and landscaping often occur in tandem with new single-family home construction, we believe the continued trend in increased housing starts also offers significant opportunities for the irrigation and landscape industry. 
Favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends have positively impacted our industry and we believe these trends will continue to do so in the long term.  These favorable trends include the following:

• | long-term growth in housing units in warmer markets due to the population migration toward the southern United States, which contributes to the growing installed base of pools that homeowners must maintain;


• | increased homeowner spending on outdoor living spaces for relaxation and entertainment;


• | consumers bundling the purchase of a swimming pool and other products, with new irrigation systems and landscaping often being key components to both pool installations and remodels; and


• | consumers using more automation and control products, higher quality materials and other pool features that add to our sales opportunities over time.

Approximately 60% of consumer spending in the pool industry is for maintenance and minor repair of existing swimming pools.  Maintaining proper chemical balance and the related upkeep and repair of swimming pool equipment, such as pumps, heaters, filters and safety equipment, creates a non-discretionary demand for pool chemicals, equipment and other related parts and supplies.  We also believe cosmetic considerations such as a pool’s appearance and the overall look of backyard environments create an ongoing demand for other maintenance-related goods and certain discretionary products.

1

We believe that the recurring nature of the maintenance and repair market has historically helped maintain a relatively consistent rate of industry growth.  This characteristic, along with relatively consistent inflationary price increases of 1% to 2% on average passed on by manufacturers and distributors, has helped cushion the negative impact on revenues in periods when unfavorable economic conditions and softness in the housing market adversely impacted pool construction and major replacement and refurbishment activities.
The following table reflects growth in the domestic installed base of in-ground swimming pools over the past 11 years (based on Company estimates and information from 2014 P.K. Data, Inc. reports):

The replacement and refurbishment market currently accounts for close to 30% of consumer spending in the pool industry.  The activity in this market, which includes major swimming pool remodeling, is driven by the aging of the installed base of pools. The timing of these types of expenditures is more sensitive to economic factors that impact consumer spending compared to the maintenance and minor repair market.
New swimming pool construction comprises the bulk of the remaining consumer spending in the pool industry.  The demand for new pools is driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership including relaxation, entertainment, family activity, exercise and convenience.  The industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer purchases such as kitchen and bathroom remodeling, boats, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and vacations.  The industry is also affected by other factors including, but not limited to, consumer preferences or attitudes toward pool and landscape products for aesthetic, environmental, safety or other reasons.
The irrigation and landscape distribution business is split between residential and commercial markets, with the majority of sales related to the residential market.  Irrigation activities account for approximately 50% of total spending in the irrigation industry, with the remaining 50% of spending related to power equipment, landscape and specialty outdoor products and accessories.  As such, our irrigation business is more heavily weighted toward new home construction activities compared to our pool business. Over the last five years, our irrigation and landscape business has benefited from the continued slow recovery of single-family home construction as irrigation system installations and landscaping projects typically correlate with, but lag, new home construction.
Certain trends in the housing market, the availability of consumer credit and general economic conditions (as commonly measured by Gross Domestic Product or GDP) affect our industry, particularly new pool and irrigation system starts as well as the timing and extent of pool refurbishments and equipment replacement.  We believe that over the long term, single-family housing turnover and home value appreciation may correlate with demand for new pool construction, with higher rates of home turnover and appreciation having a positive impact on new pool starts over time.  We also believe that homeowners’ access to consumer credit is a critical factor enabling the purchase of new swimming pools and irrigation systems.  Similar to other discretionary purchases, replacement and refurbishment activities are more heavily impacted by economic factors such as consumer confidence, GDP and employment.
2

While we estimate that new pool construction has increased to approximately 65,000 - 70,000 new units in 2016 from the historically low levels experienced during the economic downturn, construction levels are still down approximately 65% - 70% compared to peak historical levels and down approximately 55% - 60% from what we consider normal levels. 
Over the past five years, the pool industry has continued to show signs of recovery, mostly due to the gradual improvement in remodeling and replacement activity. Our consistent base business sales growth reflects increased consumer discretionary spending and higher replacement activities. Improvements in general external market factors in the United States including consumer confidence, employment, housing, access to consumer credit and economic expansion, largely support our base business growth. Over the last five years, we estimate the pool industry grew from 2% to 4% per year, with favorable weather accelerating growth in any given year and unfavorable weather impeding growth. In 2015 specifically, excessive precipitation impacted our industry in the second quarter; however a mild fall and delayed winter alleviated any contraction in industry growth rates. In 2016, an earlier start to the pool season due to warmer than usual temperatures and overall favorable weather throughout the rest of the year benefited the industry as a whole. 
We believe there is potential for continued sales recovery due to the build-up of deferred replacement and remodeling activity over the next several years and our expectation is that new pool and irrigation construction levels will gradually normalize. Additionally, we believe favorable demographics from an aging population and southern migration are ideal for increased residential investment, especially in outdoor lifestyle products. We expect that market conditions in the United States will continue to improve, enabling further recovery of replacement, remodeling and new construction activity to normalized levels over the next 4 to 7 years. We expect that the industry will realize an annual growth rate of approximately 3% to 6% over this time period. As economic trends indicate that consumer spending has been slowly recovering and that residential construction activities will likely continue to gradually improve, we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of both the eventual market recovery and the inherent long-term growth opportunities in our industry.
Our industry is seasonal and weather is one of the principal external factors that affect our business.  Peak industry activity occurs during the warmest months of the year, typically April through September.  Unseasonable warming or cooling trends can accelerate or delay the start or end of the pool and landscape season, impacting our maintenance and repair sales.  These impacts at the shoulders of the season are generally more pronounced in northern markets in the United States and Canada. Weather also impacts our sales of construction and installation products to the extent that above average precipitation, late spring thaws in northern markets and other extreme weather conditions delay, interrupt or cancel current or planned construction and installation activities.
Business Strategy and Growth
Our mission is to provide exceptional value to our customers and suppliers, in order to provide exceptional return to our shareholders while providing exceptional opportunities to our employees.  Our three core strategies are as follows:

• | to promote the growth of our industry;


• | to promote the growth of our customers’ businesses; and


• | to continuously strive to operate more effectively.

We promote the growth of our industry through various advertising and promotional programs intended to raise consumer awareness of the benefits and affordability of pool ownership, the ease of pool maintenance and the many ways in which a pool and the surrounding spaces may be enjoyed beyond swimming.  These programs include media advertising, industry-oriented website development such as www.swimmingpool.com®, public relations campaigns and other online marketing initiatives including social media.  We use these programs as tools to educate consumers and lead prospective pool owners to our customers.
We promote the growth of our customers’ businesses by offering comprehensive support programs that include promotional tools and marketing support to help our customers generate increased sales.  Our uniquely tailored programs include such features as customer lead generation, personalized websites, brochures, direct mail, marketing campaigns and business development training.  As a customer service, we also provide certain retail store customers assistance with all aspects of their business including site selection, store layout and design, product merchandising, business management system implementation, comprehensive product offering selections and efficient ordering and inventory management processes. In addition to these programs, we feature consumer showrooms in over 80 of our sales centers and host our annual Retail Summit to educate our customers about product offerings and the overall industry. We also act as a day to day resource by offering product and market expertise to serve our customers’ unique needs.

In addition to our efforts aimed at industry and customer growth, we strive to operate more effectively by continuously focusing on improvements in our operations such as product sourcing, procurement and logistics initiatives, adoption of enhanced business practices and improved working capital management.  Other key internal growth initiatives include the continued expansion of both our product offerings (as described in the “Customers and Products” section below) and our distribution networks.
With our 2008 acquisition of National Pool Tile Group, Inc., we added a market leading brand of pool tile and composite pool finish products, and gained a position in a wider market. To increase operating efficiency and improve market reach, we have consolidated and repositioned NPT standalone sales centers and established NPT showrooms within certain existing sales centers. In addition to our 17 standalone NPT sales centers, we currently have over 80 SCP and Superior sales centers that feature consumer showrooms where landscape and swimming pool contractors, as well as homeowners, can view and select pool components including tile, decking materials and interior pool finishes in various styles and grades, and serve as stocking locations for our NPT branded products. 
We feel the growth opportunities for the NPT network closely align with those of our other networks, as we see continued opportunity to expand under the NPT brand. We also expect potential expansion of the network by broadening our product range and sourcing capabilities. As more consumers create and enhance outdoor living areas and continue to invest in their outdoor environment, we believe we can focus our resources to address such demand, while leveraging our existing pool and irrigation/landscape customer base. We feel the development of our NPT network is a natural extension of our distribution model. While we are currently enjoying an expanding economy and improving housing market, which help fuel demand for these products, this business is more sensitive to these external market factors compared to our business overall. 
We have grown our distribution networks through new sales center openings, acquisitions and the expansion of existing sales centers.  Given the more stabilized external environment, we have increased our focus on new sales center openings complemented by strategic acquisitions and consolidations, depending on our market presence. Since the beginning of 2014, we have opened 13 new sales centers, with 6 new sales centers in 2016. We expect to open between 6 and 8 new sales centers in 2017. Since the beginning of 2014, we have completed 8 acquisitions consisting of 21 sales centers (net of sales center consolidations within one year of acquisition).  The acquired locations in 2016 include 8 sales centers added to our Horizon network. Our locations that were consolidated in 2016 include 3 sales centers from our SCP network, 2 from our Horizon network and 1 from our SPP network, which represents a location that was acquired in 2015 and consolidated within one year of acquisition.  We plan to continue to make strategic acquisitions and open new sales centers to further penetrate existing markets and expand into both new geographic markets and new product categories.  For additional discussion of our recent acquisitions, see Note 2 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
We believe that our high customer service levels and expanded product offerings have enabled us to gain market share historically. Going forward, we expect to realize sales growth higher than the industry average due to further increases in market share and continued expansion of our product offerings.
We estimate that price inflation has averaged 1% to 2% annually in our industry over the past 10 years.  We generally pass industry price increases through the supply chain and make strategic volume inventory purchases ahead of vendor price increases.  We estimate that annual price inflation between 2014 and 2016 was consistent with the ten-year average. We anticipate price inflation will vary some by product lines, but will approximate the ten-year average overall in 2017.
Customers and Products
We serve over 100,000 customers. In 2016, sales to our largest 100 customers collectively accounted for just under 10% of our total sales. We estimate that sales to our largest 1,000 customers represented approximately 25% of our total sales in 2016. Notably, 98% of our customers are small, family-owned businesses with relatively limited capital resources. These core customers generated a large majority of our sales in 2016. Most of these businesses provide labor and technical services to the end consumer and operate as independent contractors employing no more than ten employees (in many cases, working alone or with a limited crew).  These customers also buy from other distributors, mass merchants, home stores, and specialty and internet retailers. 
We sell our products primarily to the following types of customers:

• | swimming pool remodelers and builders;


• | specialty retailers that sell swimming pool supplies;


• | swimming pool repair and service businesses;


• | irrigation construction and landscape maintenance contractors; and


• | golf courses and other commercial customers.

We conduct our operations through 344 sales centers in North America, Europe, South America and Australia. Our primary markets, with the highest concentration of swimming pools, are California, Texas, Florida and Arizona, collectively representing approximately 52% of our 2016 net sales.  In 2016, we generated approximately 95% of our sales in North America, 5% in Europe and less than 1% in South America and Australia combined. References to product line and product category data throughout this Form 10-K generally reflect data related to the North American swimming pool market, as it is more readily available for analysis and represents the largest component of our operations.
We use a combination of local and international sales and marketing personnel to promote the growth of our business and develop and strengthen our customers’ businesses.  Our sales and marketing personnel focus on developing customer programs and promotional activities, creating and enhancing sales management tools and providing product and market expertise.  Our local sales personnel work from our sales centers and are charged with understanding and meeting our customers’ specific needs.
We offer our customers more than 160,000 manufacturer and Pool Corporation branded products.  We believe that our selection of pool equipment, supplies, chemicals, replacement parts, irrigation and landscape products and other pool construction and recreational products is the most comprehensive in the industry.  The types of products we sell are as follows:


• | maintenance products such as chemicals, supplies and pool accessories;


• | repair and replacement parts for pool equipment, such as cleaners, filters, heaters, pumps and lights;


• | packaged pool kits including walls, liners, braces and coping for in-ground and above-ground pools;


• | pool equipment and components for new pool construction and the remodeling of existing pools;


• | irrigation and landscape products, including irrigation system components and professional lawn care equipment and supplies;


• | building materials, such as concrete, plumbing and electrical components, both functional and decorative pool surfaces, decking materials, tile, hardscapes and natural stone, used for pool installations and remodeling;


• | commercial products, including ASME heaters, safety equipment, and commercial pumps and filters; and


• | other pool construction and recreational products, which consist of a number of product categories and include discretionary recreational and related outdoor lifestyle products that enhance consumers’ use and enjoyment of outdoor living spaces, such as spas, grills and components for outdoor kitchens.

We currently have over 500 product lines and over 50 product categories. Based on our 2016 product classifications, sales for our pool and spa chemicals product category as a percentage of total net sales was 13% in 2016, 2015 and 2014. In 2016 and 2015 chemical sales increased by 6% and 5%, respectively, with little benefit from pricing inflation. No other product category accounted for 10% or more of total net sales in any of the last three fiscal years.
Our maintenance, repair and replacement products are generally described as follows:

• | maintenance and minor repair (non-discretionary); and


• | major refurbishment and replacement (partially discretionary).

In 2016, the sale of maintenance and minor repair products accounted for approximately 60% of our sales and gross profits while approximately 40% of our sales and gross profits were derived from the refurbishment, replacement, construction and installation (equipment, materials, plumbing, electrical, etc.) of swimming pools. As recently as five years ago, sales of maintenance and minor repair products had increased to approximately 70% of our sales and gross profits due to the significant declines in new pool construction. This trend reflects a shift back toward a greater percentage of our sales coming from major refurbishment and replacement products due to an ongoing recovery of these activities since levels reached their historic low point in 2009. 
Discretionary demand for products related to pool construction and remodeling has been an important factor in our historical base business sales growth.  We have realized sales growth over the past five years due to our ongoing expansion of these product offerings and the steady improvement in new construction, remodeling and economic trends. However, new pool construction remains approximately 65% - 70% below peak historic levels and approximately 55% - 60% below what we believe to be normal levels. We continue to identify new related product categories and we typically introduce new categories each year in select markets.  We then evaluate the performance in these test markets and focus on those product categories that we believe exhibit the best long-term growth potential.  We expect to realize continued sales growth for these types of product offerings by expanding the number of locations that offer these products, increasing the number of products offered at certain locations and continuing a modest broadening of these product offerings on a company-wide basis.

In recent years we have experienced product and customer mix changes, including a shift in consumer spending to higher value, lower margin products such as variable speed pumps, high efficiency heaters, LED lighting and irrigation and landscape equipment, which positively contribute to our sales and gross profit growth but negatively impact our gross margin. We expect continued demand for these products, but believe our efforts in various pricing and sourcing initiatives and our expansion of building materials product offerings will help offset these gross margin declines and lead to somewhat flat gross margin trends over the next few years. 
Operating Strategy
We distribute swimming pool supplies, equipment and related leisure products domestically through our SCP and Superior networks and internationally through our SCP network. We distribute irrigation and landscape products through our Horizon network and tile, decking materials and interior pool finish products through our NPT network.  We adopted the strategy of operating two distinct distribution networks within the U.S. swimming pool market primarily for two reasons:

• | to offer our customers a choice of distinctive product selections, locations and service personnel; and


• | to increase the level of customer service and operational efficiency provided by the sales centers in each network by promoting healthy competition between the two networks.

We evaluate our sales centers based upon their performance relative to predetermined standards that include both financial and operational measures.  Our corporate support groups provide our field operations with various services, such as developing and coordinating customer and vendor related programs, information systems support and expert resources to help them achieve their goals.  We believe our incentive programs and feedback tools, along with the competitive nature of our internal networks, stimulate and enhance employee performance.
Distribution
Our sales centers are located within population centers near customer concentrations, typically in industrial, commercial or mixed‑use zones.  Customers may pick up products at any sales center location, or we may deliver products to their premises or job sites via our trucks or third party carriers.
Our sales centers maintain well-stocked inventories to meet our customers’ immediate needs.  We utilize warehouse management technology to optimize receiving, inventory control, picking, packing and shipping functions. For additional information regarding our inventory management, see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Inventory Obsolescence,” of this Form 10-K. 
We also operate four centralized shipping locations (CSLs) that redistribute products we purchase in bulk quantities to our sales centers or in some cases, directly to customers.  Our CSLs are regional locations that carry a wide range of traditional swimming pool, irrigation and related construction products.  
Purchasing and Suppliers
We enjoy good relationships with our suppliers, who generally offer competitive pricing, return policies and promotional allowances.  It is customary in our industry for certain manufacturers to manage their shipments by offering seasonal terms to qualifying purchasers such as Pool Corporation.  These terms typically allow us to place orders in the fall at a modest discount, take delivery of product during the off-season months and pay for these purchases in the spring or early summer.
Our preferred vendor program encourages our distribution networks to stock and sell products from a smaller number of vendors to optimize profitability and shareholder return.  We also work closely with our vendors to develop programs and services to better meet the needs of our customers and to concentrate our inventory investments.  These practices, together with a more comprehensive service offering, have positively impacted our selling margins and our returns on inventory investments.
We regularly evaluate supplier relationships and consider alternate sourcing to assure competitive cost, service and quality standards.  Our largest suppliers include Pentair Water Pool and Spa, Inc., Hayward Pool Products, Inc. and Zodiac Pool Systems, Inc., which accounted for approximately 20%, 10% and 8%, respectively, of the cost of products we sold in 2016.

Competition
We are the largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool and related backyard products (based on industry knowledge and available data) and the only truly national wholesale distributor focused on the swimming pool industry in the United States.  We are also one of the top three distributors of irrigation and landscape products in the United States.  We face intense competition from many regional and local distributors in our markets and from one national wholesale distributor of irrigation and landscape products.  We also face competition, both directly and indirectly, from mass-market retailers and large pool supply retailers (both store-based and internet) who buy directly from manufacturers. 
Some geographic markets we serve, particularly the four largest and higher pool density markets of California, Texas, Florida and Arizona, have a greater concentration of competition than others.  Barriers to entry in our industry are relatively low.  We believe that the principal competitive factors in swimming pool and landscape supply distribution are:

• | the breadth and availability of products offered;


• | the quality and level of customer service;


• | the breadth and depth of sales and marketing programs;


• | consistency and stability of business relationships with customers and suppliers;


• | competitive product pricing; and


• | access to commercial credit to finance business working capital.

We believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to each of these factors.
Seasonality and Weather
For a discussion regarding seasonality and weather, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations,” of this Form 10-K.
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulations
Our business is subject to regulation under local fire codes and international, federal, state and local environmental and health and safety requirements, including regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Department of Transportation, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the National Fire Protection Agency and the International Maritime Organization. Most of these requirements govern the packaging, labeling, handling, transportation, storage and sale of chemicals and fertilizers. We store certain types of chemicals and/or fertilizers at each of our sales centers and the storage of these items is strictly regulated by local fire codes. In addition, we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act and various state pesticide laws. These laws primarily relate to labeling, annual registration and licensing.
Employees
We employed approximately 3,900 people at December 31, 2016. Given the seasonal nature of our business, our peak employment period is the summer and, depending on expected sales levels, we add 200 to 500 employees to our work force to meet seasonal demand.
Intellectual Property
We maintain both domestic and foreign registered trademarks and patents, primarily for our Pool Corporation and Pool Systems Pty. Ltd. (PSL) branded products that are important to our current and future business operations. We also own rights to numerous internet domain names.
