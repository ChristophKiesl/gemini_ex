ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 
We are a blank check company incorporated on June 12, 2020 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.
 
In June 2020, we issued 14,375,000 founder shares to our sponsor for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.002 per share. In July 2020, our sponsor transferred to our independent directors an aggregate of 75,000 founder shares at the same price originally paid for such shares.
 
The registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-239572) for our initial public offering were declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on August 4, 2020. On August 7, 2020, we consummated our initial public offering of 50,000,000 units, and on September 21, 2020 we sold an additional 7,500,000 units as a result of the underwriters’ full exercise of their over-allotment option, with each unit consisting of one share of Class A common stock and one-third of one redeemable warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The units in our initial public offering were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating total gross proceeds of $575,000,000.
 
Simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering and the full over-allotment option, we consummated the private placement of an aggregate of 9,000,000 private placement warrants to our sponsor at a price of $1.50 per private placement warrant, generating total gross proceeds of $13,500,000 (the “private placement”).
 
A total of $575,000,000 (or $10.00 per unit sold in our initial public offering) of the net proceeds from our initial public offering and the private placement was placed in a trust account established for the benefit of our public stockholders (the “trust account”), with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and has been invested only in U.S. “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), having a maturity of 185 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of our initial business combination within the required time period and (ii) the distribution of the trust account, as described below, except that interest earned on the trust account can be released to pay our taxes payable and for dissolution expenses up to $100,000, as applicable.
 
We paid a total of $11,500,000 in underwriting discounts and approximately $623,000 for other offering costs and expenses related to our initial public offering. In addition, the underwriters agreed to defer $20,125,000 in underwriting discounts and commissions.
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $1.3 million outside of the trust account, approximately $0.3 million of investment income available in the trust account to pay for tax obligations (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), and a working capital surplus of approximately $1.1 million.
 
Our units began trading on August 5, 2020 on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbol “GOAC.U.” Commencing on September 25, 2020, the shares of Class A common stock and warrants comprising the units began separate trading on the NYSE under the symbols “GOAC” and “GOAC WS,” respectively. Those units not separated continue to trade on the NYSE under the symbol “GOAC.U.”
 
We intend to focus our efforts on identifying a prospective target business with either all or a substantial portion of its activities in North America or Europe. We expect to focus on travel-related and travel-adjacent businesses that have attractive growth-oriented characteristics and strong underlying demand drivers which include business services and travel infrastructure platforms such as visa processing, settlement systems and payment platforms. We expect that these target investments will have characteristics appropriate for public companies and, accordingly, or due to other characteristics, will not be suitable for private equity-style investments. As we focus our efforts on identifying a prospective target company or business, we will seek to capitalize on the multiple decades of combined investment experience and vast relationship networks of our founders, Noam Gottesman and M. Gregory O’Hara. However, we do not intend to target investments that are competitive with Nomad Foods Limited (“Nomad Foods”), Radius Global Infrastructure, Inc. (“Radius”) or any portfolio companies, investments or investment mandates of Certares Management LLC and its affiliated funds (“Certares”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, our efforts on identifying a prospective target company or business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region.

It has been noted that total global travel spending has increased substantially, from $3.7 trillion in 2009 to $5.7 trillion in 2018, becoming one of the largest and fastest growing economic sectors in the world. In 2018, travel and tourism represented 10.4% of worldwide gross domestic product and was expected to continue growing. We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has created temporary dislocation in the travel-related and travel-adjacent sectors and specifically has adversely affected the ability of companies and business divisions in these sectors to access public markets through traditional initial public offerings or spin-offs. We believe there are many potential targets within the space that are both attractive acquisition opportunities and positioned to deliver substantial value to stockholders in the public markets.
 
Mr. Gottesman has spent his career building, operating and investing in businesses both in the private and public markets. Mr. Gottesman’s varied experience includes co-founding GLG Partners Inc. and its predecessor entities (“GLG”), a leading multi-strategy asset management platform, and, in 2012, founding TOMS Capital LLC, a New York-based actively-managed single-family office with diverse investments across consumer, retail, hospitality, real estate, technology and financial services (“TOMS Capital”). Furthermore, Mr. Gottesman has co-founded two previous acquisition vehicles, Nomad Holdings Limited (“Nomad”) and Landscape Acquisition Holdings Limited (“Landscape”), and in January 2021 Mr. Gottesman co-founded an additional acquisition vehicle, N2 Acquisition Holdings Corp (“N2”).
 
Mr. O’Hara has deep experience investing institutional capital across a variety of asset classes. Mr. O’Hara is the founder and President of Clementine Investments LLC (“Clementine Investments”), the investment arm of Mr. O’Hara’s family office which has diverse investments in hotels, hospitality, restaurants, consumer goods, media and entertainment and real estate and is the founder and Senior Managing Director of Certares, a multi-billion dollar private equity firm specializing in direct private investment in the travel and hospitality sectors.
 
We are confident that the combined experience of our management team makes us well situated to identify, source, negotiate and execute an initial business combination with an attractive company or business in the travel-related and travel-adjacent sectors. Investment opportunities will be sourced from our founders’ operating network of executives, investors and advisors, which include opportunities in the form of private equity investments, family owned businesses or divisions of larger corporations. Our founders will employ a disciplined and highly selective investment process and expect to add value to a target company through add-on acquisitions, capital structure optimization and operational improvements.
 
Mr. Gottesman co-founded GLG as a division of Lehman Brothers International (Europe) in 1995 where he was a Managing Director. Under Mr. Gottesman’s leadership, GLG managed approximately $31 billion in assets at its peak. At GLG, Mr. Gottesman served in various chief executive capacities until January 2012, including as chief executive officer from September 2005 until January 2012. Mr. Gottesman was also chairman of the board of GLG following its merger with Freedom Acquisition Holdings Inc. and prior to its acquisition by Man Group plc.
 
In April 2014, Mr. Gottesman co-founded Nomad, an acquisition vehicle which completed its $500 million initial public offering and listing on the London Stock Exchange. In June 2015, Nomad acquired Iglo Foods Holdings Limited, a leading frozen food company in Europe whose brands at that time included Birds Eye in the U.K. and Ireland, Findus in Italy and Iglo in Germany and continental Europe, for approximately €2.6 billion which was funded in part by a private placement of approximately $795 million. Upon closing of the acquisition, the combined company subsequently changed its name to Nomad Foods Limited. Nomad Foods relisted on the New York Stock Exchange in 2016 and is currently Europe’s largest frozen foods business. Subsequent to the initial transaction, Nomad Foods has acquired Findus Sverige AB, Green Isle Foods Ltd., Aunt Bessie’s Limited and Findus Switzerland for aggregate consideration of approximately $1.4 billion. Mr. Gottesman continues to serve as co-chairman of Nomad Foods’ board of directors.

In November 2017, Mr. Gottesman co-founded Landscape, an acquisition vehicle which completed its $500 million initial public offering and listing on the London Stock Exchange. In February 2020, Landscape acquired AP WIP Investments Holdings LP (“AP Wireless”), a U.S.-based owner of wireless communications property sites across 19 countries for approximately $860 million which was funded in part by a private placement of $100 million by Centerbridge Partners LP. Post-closing, the company was re-named Digital Landscape Group Inc. and subsequently re-named Radius Global Infrastructure, Inc. (NASDAQ: RADI).
 
In January 2021, Mr. Gottesman co-founded N2, a blank check company formed for substantially similar purposes as our company but without a travel-related and travel-adjacent business focus. N2 has not yet completed its initial public offering. Mr. Gottesman, who serves as our Co-Chief Executive Officer and one of our directors, also serves as Co-Chairman of N2. In addition, certain of our officers are also officers of N2.
 
Prior to founding Clementine Investments and Certares, Mr. O’Hara served as the Chief Investment Officer of J.P. Morgan Chase’s Special Investment Group (“JPM SIG”). Prior to JPM SIG, Mr. O’Hara was a Managing Director of One Equity Partners (“OEP”), the private equity arm of JP Morgan. Prior to joining OEP in 2005, Mr. O’Hara served as Executive Vice President of Worldspan. Mr. O’Hara has deep investment and operational expertise in the travel sector, having invested billions of equity capital in the space and realizing significant returns. Mr. O’Hara brings operational expertise resulting from his experience and continued focus on the travel services, tourism, hospitality, travel-related business and consumer services sectors. Mr. O’Hara is the Executive Chairman of American Express Global Business Travel (“Amex GBT”) and Vice Chairman of Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. and serves on the Boards of Directors of Tripadvisor, Inc., The Innocence Project, Mystic Invest and World Travel & Tourism Council.
 
Mr. O’Hara and his team at Clementine Investments have a specialty of sourcing unique joint venture, spin-out and partnership opportunities at attractive valuations. In 2003, Mr. O’Hara led a syndicate of institutional investors in acquiring Worldspan from a group of airlines. In 2014, Mr. O’Hara, through a Certares affiliate, led a partnership spin-out of American Express’s corporate travel management business, Amex GBT, with American Express retaining 50% ownership of Amex GBT and the other 50% being owned by a Certares special purpose vehicle backed by leading sovereign wealth, institutional, pension and endowment investors.
 
We believe that our management team is well positioned to identify attractive business combination opportunities with a compelling industry backdrop and an opportunity for transformational growth. Our objectives are to generate attractive returns for our stockholders and enhance value through improving operational performance of the acquired company. We expect to favor potential target companies with certain industry and business characteristics. Key industry characteristics include compelling long-term growth prospects, attractive competitive dynamics, consolidation opportunities and low risk of technological obsolescence. Key business characteristics include high barriers to entry, significant streams of recurring revenue, opportunity for operational improvement, attractive steady-state margins, high incremental margins and attractive free cash flow characteristics.
 
With respect to the above, past experience or performance of our management team and their respective affiliates is not a guarantee of either (i) our ability to successfully identify and execute a transaction or (ii) success with respect to any business combination that we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of our management team or their respective affiliates as indicative of future performance. Our management team and their respective affiliates have been involved with a large number of public and private companies in addition to those identified above, not all of which have achieved similar performance levels. See “Risk Factors — Past performance by our management team or their respective affiliates (including our founders) may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us or in the future performance of any business that we may acquire.”
 
Business Strategy
 
Our business strategy is to identify and complete our initial business combination with a company that complements the experience of our founders and can benefit from their operational and investment expertise. Our selection process will leverage Mr. Gottesman’s and Mr. O’Hara’s broad and deep relationship network, unique industry experiences and deal-sourcing capabilities to access a broad spectrum of differentiated opportunities. This network has been developed through our founders’ demonstrated success both investing in and operating businesses across a variety of industries, developing a distinctive combination of capabilities including:

● | a track record of creating and growing multi-billion dollar platforms in the public markets;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | extensive M&A experience, including driving transformational transactions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the ability to enhance and advise management teams as they transition from private to public markets;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | experience driving capital allocation decisions at the corporate level;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | understanding of public market performance and requirements;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | history of sourcing, structuring, acquiring, operating, developing, growing, financing and selling businesses;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | deep relationships with sellers, financing providers and target management teams; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | an extensive history of accessing the capital markets across various business cycles, including financing businesses and assisting companies with transition to public ownership.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Acquisition Criteria
 
Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to acquire one or more businesses that we believe:

● | have a strong competitive industry position, with demonstrated competitive advantages to maintain barriers to entry;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | have strong free cash flow characteristics with a desirable return on capital;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | have a strong, experienced management team which would benefit from our founders’ network or expertise, such as additional management expertise, capital structure optimization, acquisition advice or operational changes to drive improved financial performance;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | are fundamentally sound companies with a proven track record;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | will offer an attractive risk-adjusted return for our stockholders; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | can benefit from being a publicly traded company, are prepared to be a publicly traded company and can utilize access to broader capital markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors, criteria and guidelines that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria and guidelines in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this prospectus, would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the SEC.
 
In addition to any potential business candidates we may identify on our own, we anticipate that other target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions.
 
Our Acquisition Process
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct an extensive due diligence review which may encompass, as applicable and among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities and a review of financial, operational, legal and other information about the target and its industry. We will also utilize our management team’s operational and capital planning experience.

Each of our directors and officers, directly or indirectly, owns founder shares and/or private placement warrants and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, such directors and officers may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such directors and officers was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
 
Certain of our officers and directors presently have, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities, including N2, pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity subject to his or her fiduciary duties. As a result, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, then, subject to such officer’s and director’s fiduciary duties, he or she will need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, before we can pursue such opportunity. If these other entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. However, we do not expect these duties or obligations to materially affect our ability to identify and pursue business combination opportunities or complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any business combination opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the company and it is an opportunity that we are able to complete on a reasonable basis.
 
In addition, our founders, officers and directors, are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. See “Risk Factors — Our executive officers and directors will allocate their time to other businesses thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs. This conflict of interest could have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business combination.”
 
Initial Business Combination
 
In accordance with the rules of the NYSE, our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting discounts held in trust) at the time of signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. We refer to this as the 80% of net assets test. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). Even though our board of directors will rely on generally accepted standards, our board of directors will have discretion to select the standards employed. In addition, the application of the standards generally involves a substantial degree of judgment. Accordingly, investors will be relying on the business judgment of the board of directors in evaluating the fair market value of the target or targets. The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public stockholders with our analysis of our satisfaction of the 80% of net assets test, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board of directors is not able independently to determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., or FINRA, or an independent valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of a target business or businesses, it may be unable to do so if the board is less familiar or experienced with the target company’s business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the target company’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value of the target business meets the 80% of net assets test, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a target business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our stockholders. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to stockholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed transaction will include such opinion.

We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-business combination company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to foregoing, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
 
To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
 
Other Considerations
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, founders, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor or any of our founders, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that such initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
 
Our founders and our directors and officers may sponsor, form or participate in other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies, including N2, may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target, particularly in the event there is overlap among investment mandates. However, we do not currently expect that any such other blank check company, including N2, would materially affect our ability to identify and pursue business combination opportunities or complete our initial business combination.

Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Employees
 
We currently have five executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
Our Website
 
Our corporate website address is https://www.goacquisition.com/. The information contained on, or accessible through our corporate website or any other website that we may maintain is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
 
We have registered our units, Class A common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
 
We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with GAAP and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with PCAOB standards. We cannot assure you that any particular target business selected by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and PCAOB standards or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with GAAP and PCAOB standards. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.

We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements on our internal control over financial reporting. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
 
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter.
