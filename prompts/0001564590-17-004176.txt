Overview 
 We are a late-stage clinical biologics platform company focused on the global biosimilar market. Biosimilars are an emerging class of protein-based therapeutics with high similarity to approved originator products on the basis of various physicochemical and structural properties, as well as in terms of safety, purity and potency. Our goal is to become a global leader in the biosimilar market by leveraging our team’s collective expertise in key areas such as process science, analytical characterization, protein production and clinical-regulatory development. Since our founding in 2010, we have advanced three product candidates into Phase 3 clinical studies or filed for a Biologics License Application (BLA) enabling clinical development, entered into partnerships with two global pharmaceutical companies and entered into an agreement with one strategic biologics manufacturer.
 Our business is organized around therapeutic franchises: 
  
1) | Oncology biosimilar candidates pegfilgrastim (Neulasta), which has been filed for approval in both the United States and Europe with regulatory action expected in both geographies as early as in 2017, and bevacizumab (Avastin®), which is in preclinical stage;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Immunology (Anti-TNF) biosimilar candidates etanercept (Enbrel) and adalimumab (Humira®), which are both in post-Phase 3 top-line result clinical-stage;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | Ophthalmology biosimilar candidate ranibizumab (Lucentis®), in preclinical stage; and
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4) | Multiple sclerosis small molecule therapeutic candidate, CHS-131, which completed a Phase 2b proof-of-concept trial in 2016.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oncology Biosimilars
 CHS-1701 stimulates production of granulocytes (a type of white blood cell) in order to promote the body’s ability to fight infections. In March 2015, we initiated a pivotal pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) study for CHS-1701 in the U.S. comparing CHS-1701 to Neulasta, which we reported in October 2015. This study met its primary PD endpoints of absolute neutrophil count (ANC). In terms of PK parameters, the study also met bioequivalence for Cmax. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) portion of the PK results did not meet bioequivalence due to the presence of a low, anomalous PK profile in the first treatment period Neulasta group. Although this PK/PD study is acceptable to support filing the BLA, we initiated a follow-on PK/PD study in February 2016, which met its primary clinical endpoints in July 2016. We initiated an immunogenicity study in healthy volunteers pursuant to this BLA in May 2015 and reported in February 2016 that CHS-1701 met its immunogenicity endpoints. We filed for marketing approval in the U.S. on August 9, 2016 and have an action date with the FDA of June 9, 2017. We filed for approval in Europe in October 2016 and anticipate an action date with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in the fourth quarter of 2017. We plan on marketing this product candidate ourselves in the U.S. and we are seeking to partner commercially in Europe. 
 We are developing master cell banks for several new biosimilar candidates of biologic therapeutics in oncology, including CHS-5217. As we intend to commercialize CHS-1701 in the U.S., we anticipate being able to commercialize other oncology biosimilar candidates in the U.S. as well. We will seek to find a commercial partner for all oncology biosimilars outside the U.S.

Anti-TNF Biosimilars
 Our clinical-stage pipeline consists of two anti-tumor necrosis factors, or anti-TNFs. TNF is a substance in the body that is involved in the inflammatory response. Our most clinically advanced anti-TNF product candidate, CHS-0214, is an etanercept (Enbrel) biosimilar candidate for which we have partnered with Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited, or Daiichi Sankyo, in Japan. Outside of Japan, Coherus has global rights to CHS-0214. We have completed two Phase 3 clinical trials with CHS-0214 in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, which met their primary clinical endpoints in November 2015 and January 2016, respectively. Our second anti-TNF product candidate, CHS-1420, is an adalimumab (Humira) biosimilar candidate, and completed Phase 1 studies in August 2014. In August 2016, we announced positive 12-week results from a Phase 3 study in psoriasis patients and, in January 2017, positive confirmatory results at 24-weeks in the same study for CHS-1420 to support the planned filing of a marketing application in the U.S. and in the European Union (E.U.) in the first half of 2017.
 We intend to find commercialization partners for all of our anti-TNF or anti-inflammatory biosimilar candidates.
 Overview of the Market Opportunity for Biosimilars
 According to Evaluate Pharma, total global annual revenues from the anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha, or anti-TNF-a, adalimumab, etanercept and pegfilgrastim-based originator products exceeded approximately $30 billion in 2016. We intend to pursue a brand strategy for our biosimilar products that projects high similarity to the originator and positive differentiation to competing biosimilars at a competitive price. 
 The global market opportunity for biosimilars is emerging as a result of several factors. First, through 2020, 30 “blockbuster” biologics, each with worldwide annual sales in excess of $1 billion, face loss of patent exclusivity in at least one major pharmaceutical market. These products achieved approximately $109 billion in aggregate worldwide sales in 2016. Second, regulatory agencies around the world have responded to these upcoming patent expirations by defining new biosimilar approval pathways. We believe these regulatory initiatives will help streamline the approval process across various international regulatory agencies and encourage growth of the overall biosimilar market. Third, implementation of more stringent cost containment practices on the part of governments and insurers has increased demand for high-quality biosimilars, which we believe will result in substantial market growth over time. 
 While the potential market opportunity is significant, biosimilar product development poses a number of scientific, regulatory and technical challenges that distinguish it from traditional, small-molecule generic product development. We believe our world-class team of biologic therapeutic developers and renowned scientists gives us the critical capabilities to successfully address the complexities underlying these challenges. Our team includes industry veterans with decades of experience in pioneering biologics companies, such as Amgen and Genentech, where they were responsible for leading, and in some cases establishing, these organizations’ core capabilities in process development, protein manufacturing and analytical research and development as well as sales and marketing. We have also assembled a distinguished scientific advisory board of leading scientists who are acknowledged experts in their respective fields. 
 Our business model places our internal team at the center of a coordinated development effort in which our senior team of experts focuses on the highly-specialized, strategic and technical aspects of biosimilar development that are core to our business and difficult to replicate. For other aspects of our operations that require greater scale or more capital-intensive investments, we have established a network of relationships with highly-competent external organizations and strategic partnerships that we believe will provide the competitive scale required to address the global biosimilar market opportunity. For example, in December 2015, we entered into a strategic manufacturing agreement with KBI Biopharma, Inc. (KBI Biopharma) for long-term commercial manufacturing of CHS-1701. In addition, our dynamic organization allows us to respond to the rapidly evolving biosimilar landscape. 
 Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to become a leading global biosimilar company. The five key elements of our strategy are to: 
  
• | Leverage our platform and internal expertise in process science, molecular biology and protein production, as well as our clinical, regulatory and commercial strategies, to screen and select biosimilar candidates. Our team possesses a deep understanding of the technical advancements that enable the development of biosimilars. We believe we are able to effectively select product candidates using a stringent process that factors in technical feasibility, size of originator products opportunity and market receptivity to biosimilars, as well as other criteria. With this comprehensive approach, we believe we are able to move quickly and in a capital-efficient manner to advance product candidates into clinical trials with strong potential to be partnered and commercialized.

• | Advance our lead programs through clinical development to secure approvals in major markets. We have developed a clinical-stage pipeline consisting of three product candidates. In June and July 2014, we initiated our first Phase 3 clinical trials, advancing CHS-0214 in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, to support the planned filing of a marketing application in Europe and Japan in 2017. We initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial of CHS-1420 in psoriasis in August 2015 to support the planned filing of a marketing application in the U.S. and the E.U. in 2017. For CHS-1701, we filed for marketing approval in the U.S. in August 2016 and in Europe in October of 2016. To support these filings, we successfully completed pivotal pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and immunogenicity studies. We attempt to adapt our clinical trials to meet the regulatory requirements of multiple jurisdictions, including the U.S., Europe and Japan, such that one set of pivotal clinical trials may be sufficient for approval in all jurisdictions. We believe we can advance CHS-1701 to a 351(k) (biosimilar) approval application without a collaboration or licensing partner.

• | Continue to advance our early-stage product pipeline. We will apply our team’s expertise and our platform to identify and pursue multiple additional biosimilar product opportunities. In addition to our clinical-stage product candidate portfolio, we have identified at least two potential product candidates (including CHS-5217, bevacizumab (Avastin) and CHS-3351, ranibizumab (Lucentis) biosimilar product candidates) that meet our stringent selection criteria, which have entered early development. Our goal is to advance at least one of these product candidates into clinical trials in 2017. We continue to evaluate other potential product development candidates to further expand our pipeline.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maximize the value of our portfolio and pipeline by retaining commercial rights to our products for our oncology biosimilar candidates in the United States and by partnering with leading pharmaceutical companies to commercialize our products in other therapeutic areas. We intend to retain U.S. rights to our oncology assets while licensing rights in exchange for upfront, cost sharing, milestone and royalty payments for our assets in other therapeutic areas. For example, we have partnered with Daiichi Sankyo to commercialize CHS-0214 in Japan and we may seek a partner for CHS-1420 in 2017 in some or all territories. Such arrangements are intended to support the clinical studies required for regulatory approval of our product candidates and provide us with financial resources and enhanced commercial access.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Attract and retain exceptionally capable team members who share our vision of bringing high quality, lower cost biologic therapeutics to patients. We value the experience that has been gained by our veteran team members over the course of decades in the biotechnology industry as essential for execution at all stages of biosimilar product development. Our level of technical expertise is also rare, difficult for others to replicate and a basis for screening those who would join our team. We intend to maintain the capabilities that will enable us to realize our vision of expanding patient access to high quality, lower cost biologic therapeutics globally.

Background on Biosimilars 
 Significant Market Opportunity 
 According to the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics, the 2015 global biologics market represented over $200 billion in sales, with virtually the entire market composed of branded originator products. Patent expirations for many commercially successful branded biologic products will provide an unprecedented opportunity for cost containment through the introduction of biosimilars. Through 2020, 30 major branded biologic products, each with worldwide annual sales in excess of $1 billion, face loss of patent exclusivity in at least one major pharmaceutical market. These products achieved approximately $109 billion in aggregate worldwide sales in 2016. We believe this wave of patent expirations will create one of the most significant opportunities for the biotechnology industry in the coming years. The following originator products (all of which are “blockbuster” biologics) are facing loss of patent exclusivity in at least one major market through 2020: 

Actemra Advate Avastin Avonex Botox Enbrel Epogen Erbitux | Herceptin Humalog Humira Kogenate Lantus Levemir Lucentis Neulasta | Neupogen Norditropin SimpleXx NovoMix 30 NovoRapid Orencia Pediarix Pegasys Procrit | Rebif Remicade Rituxan Synagis Tysabri Xolair
----------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------

 Escalating healthcare costs and healthcare reform have been major drivers for the advancement of the biosimilar market. Governments and insurers are in search of mechanisms to contain costs and expand patient access without sacrificing quality of care. Further, governments and private-payors are using an increasing and disproportionate amount of healthcare spending on biologic therapeutics. According to data from Express Scripts, approximately $4 out of every $10 spent on prescription drugs in 2016 in the U.S. is projected to be spent on specialty medications, mostly complex biologics that are only used by 2% of the population.

Compounding the issue is the fact that biologic therapeutic costs are escalating at an increasingly unsustainable rate. IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics also reported that the total spend increase for specialty biologic therapeutics in 2015 was as high as approximately 22%, depending on payor segment. Consequently, we believe there is tremendous cost pressure to bring high-quality, lower-priced biologic therapeutics to market. We further believe our products target payor segments having among the highest rates of spending and anticipated spending growth, including inflammation and cancer.
 We expect the biosimilar marketplace to have several distinct characteristics as it develops. First, it is likely to become a branded market without significant participation by generic small molecule manufacturers, who are less likely to have the technical, regulatory and clinical expertise required to succeed in this market. Second, the biosimilar markets we expect to target are unlikely to default to interchangeability in the near to medium term, which means the prescription decision will not exclusively reside in the hands of pharmacists or payors but also in the hands of physicians, requiring commercialization efforts to drive sales. We believe that the biosimilar market adoption and penetration rates for each biosimilar will primarily be determined by four key factors: (1) patient criticality (the degree of severity in the patient’s condition), (2) rapidity of feedback on the safety and efficacy of the drug based on the patient response, (3) the physician and patient share influence relative to the payor in the prescribing decision and (4) the prevalence of payor incentives to drive substitution. We believe there will be strong market adoption and penetration for our CHS-1701, CHS-0214 and CHS-1420 biosimilars particularly due to low patient criticality and payor incentives. We believe that the participation of major pharmaceutical firms, including Pfizer, Inc., or Pfizer, and Sandoz International GmbH, or Sandoz, in the biosimilar markets that we are targeting indicates that there will be a relatively small number of biosimilar competitors, pricing stability and favorable market dynamics. 
 The Challenge of Biosimilar Product Development 
 Proteins consist of one or more long chains of amino acids and perform a vast array of functions within living organisms, including catalyzing metabolic reactions, replicating DNA, responding to stimuli and transporting molecules from one location to another. Such protein molecules differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which results in folding of the protein into a specific three-dimensional structure that determines its activity. 
 Although the sequence of amino acids in a protein is consistently replicated, there are a number of changes that can occur following synthesis that create inherent variability. Chief among these is the glycosylation, or the attachment of sugars at certain amino acids. Most protein-based therapeutics, including all monoclonal antibodies, are glycosylated to some degree. Monoclonal antibodies are identical antibodies that have an affinity for the same antigen and are produced by a specific clone or cell line. The glycosylation of monoclonal antibodies and other protein-based therapeutics can be critical to half-life, efficacy and even safety of the therapeutic and is therefore a key consideration for biosimilarity. Defining and understanding the variability of an originator molecule in order to match its glycosylation profile requires significant skill in cell biology, protein purification and analytical protein chemistry. Furthermore, manufacturing proteins with reliable and consistent glycosylation profiles at scale is challenging and highly dependent on the skill of the cell biologist and process scientist. 
 Protein-based therapeutics are inherently heterogeneous and their structure is highly dependent on the production process and conditions. Products from one production facility can differ within an acceptable range from those produced in another facility. Similarly, physicochemical differences can also exist among different lots produced within a single facility. The physicochemical complexity and size of biologic therapeutics creates significant technical and scientific challenges in the context of their replication as biosimilar products. This is further exacerbated by the fact that some originator product’s quality characteristics, such as glycosylation, have been shown to change or “drift” over time. 
 Accordingly, inherent variation is a fundamental consideration with respect to establishing biosimilarity to an originator product to support regulatory approval requirements. Since the product quality characteristics of originator molecules exist as a range of values rather than as an absolute, as it is the case for small-molecule therapeutic generics, regulators have issued guidelines that require demonstration of biological similarity and functional equivalence. Thus, we believe the ultimate result of protein heterogeneity and complexity is a biosimilar market where only organizations with great technical skill can compete successfully and will do so in a market of relatively few participants and relatively stable prices. 
 Our Approach 
 Our Platform 
 The essential elements of our platform that distinguish our development approach include: 
  
• | Advanced proprietary analytics. Regulators require extensive and sophisticated analytics to demonstrate comparability with the originator molecule. Analytical techniques, such as mass spectrometry, which enable the measurement of the structure and elemental composition of individual molecules, are an essential tool in this process, and we have invested a substantial part of our capital budget in this area.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Molecular tuning to achieve biosimilarity. Accurately reproducing the glycosylation pattern of the originator protein is particularly critical to successful development of a biosimilar, as this profile can substantially impact pharmacokinetics and biologic activity. By conducting a number of critical steps in a parallel fashion, we have been able to complete this process for our etanercept (Enbrel) biosimilar product candidate in an extremely short period of time while achieving a high degree of biosimilarity. A similar parallel process has been applied to our other biosimilar product candidates.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Process science. We design and develop systems that integrate state-of-the-art growth media, chromatography resins, filters and techniques to produce our products. We have demonstrated that our protein production processes are highly scalable, extremely robust and easily automated, resulting in consistent product quality, biosimilarity and yield.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Intellectual Property. We believe our expertise and investment in the discovery of proprietary technologies, such as in the area of protein stabilization, enhances our ability to create intellectual property that can enable us to innovate around patent protected features of originator products. For example, stabilization of protein in solution (the protein’s ability to maintain its three dimensional structure and biological activity) is an essential part of obtaining a commercially viable therapeutic. While originator companies have pursued a strategy of establishing intellectual property around certain patent protected formulations, we believe our investment in proprietary formulation technology allows us to differentiate our products in order to avoid such patent protected formulations, thereby enabling earlier market entry than otherwise would be possible. In particular, we note that the originator formulations for Humira and Enbrel are subject to unexpired patents that specify use of various formulation ingredients and properties. We have developed proprietary formulations for our Enbrel and Humira biosimilar products which do not require these features.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Global regulatory strategy and clinical development. The global biosimilar regulatory environment is rapidly evolving and differs significantly from that of innovator products. We and our partners have met with competent authorities in the U.S., the E.U. and Japan and have gained deep insight into the regulatory rationale and nuanced approach required to successfully navigate global requirements.

Five Key Steps to Biosimilar Drug Development 
 We apply our platform to five key steps of biosimilar development that are designed to provide the analytical, nonclinical and clinical basis to establish biosimilarity and support regulatory approval of our product candidates. We have had meetings with regulatory agencies in several of the major regulated markets to discuss our three most advanced product candidates and the data that will be required to support marketing approval. The outcomes of these discussions have informed our clinical designs, product development and regulatory strategies.
Step 1: Cell Line Development and Manufacturing 
 The amino acid sequence of the candidate biosimilar molecule must precisely match that of the originator. We have found that publicly available data can be unreliable in some instances. Therefore, we validate the amino acid sequence of all candidate biosimilar products prior to developing clones. While all clones are expected to produce proteins with the same primary sequence, it is essential to select clones which produce protein that most closely matches the glycosylation profile of the originator, since such product quality characteristics impact pharmacokinetics, or PK, and pharmacodynamics, or PD, properties as well as safety and efficacy of the molecule. A process to manufacture the desired product must be developed, scaled-up and implemented in a Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, facility in order to be used in human clinical trials. 
Step 2: Analytical Characterization and In Vitro Comparability 
 Once a biosimilar product candidate has been manufactured, we use sophisticated analytical methods and equipment as well as highly trained analysts in order to detect, analyze and interpret the chemical and structural similarity between our biosimilar candidate and the originator product. We test for comparability of biologic activity using a battery of sensitive in vitro pharmacology assays that demonstrate binding characteristics, functionality and mechanism of action. These data may be predictive of clinically relevant differences in PK, PD, efficacy, safety and immunogenicity between our biosimilar candidate and the originator product. 
Step 3: In Vivo Animal Comparability 
 Following demonstration of in vitro biosimilarity, we compare our biosimilar product candidate to the originator product in relevant animal models using the intended dosage form and route of administration prior to performing human clinical trials. As PK, PD and safety observations from these studies may be predictive of the human clinical trial experience, it is important to perform these studies in animals before proceeding to human clinical trials. Generally speaking, two studies are required in relevant animal models to provide sufficient nonclinical rationale to advance to a pivotal Phase 1 study. 
 6


Step 4: Pivotal Phase 1 Human Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Study 
 An essential global regulatory requirement is the completion of a clinical study in a sufficient number of human subjects directly comparing the originator product and our biosimilar product candidate to establish PK/PD similarity. The U.S. and European regulatory agencies have established requirements for bioequivalence with respect to three prospectively defined parameters as follows: 

• | C max : maximum measured serum concentration;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | AUC 0 - t : area under the concentration-time curve from the first time point measured (0) to the last time point measured (t); and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AUC 0-inf : area under the concentration-time curve from the first time point measured (0) extrapolated to infinity.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The area under the curve, or the AUC, is a measure of how much of a drug is in a patient’s system over a given time period. In order to calculate the AUC, the concentration of the drug in blood serum or plasma is plotted over time starting at the time the drug is administered and ending when the last time point is collected (AUC 0-t ) or when the serum or plasma concentration would be below the level of detection or zero (AUC 0- inf ), and then the area under this curve is calculated. To be deemed bioequivalent, regulators require that, for each parameter, the ratio of the originator product and the biosimilar candidate fall within 80% and 125%, with the identical match being at 100%. 
 Step 5: Phase 3 Confirmatory Safety and Efficacy Clinical Trials 
 The final step to support approval is a single Phase 3 confirmatory safety and efficacy study in a therapeutic indication for which the originator product has been approved. The objective of this study is to demonstrate biosimilarity between the originator and biosimilar therapeutics with respect to safety and efficacy. Subject to discussions with regulators and agreement on trial endpoints, we strive to demonstrate that our biosimilar products are as effective and safe as the originators. Trial endpoints include considerations such as the number of subjects, statistical significance, confidence intervals and accumulated safety database size.

1 | The therapeutic protein in etanercept is subject to certain originator-controlled U.S. patents expiring in 2028 and 2029. Assuming these patents are valid and enforceable, and that we would be unable to obtain a license to them, we do not expect to commercialize CHS-0214 in the U.S. prior to their expiration.

Oncology Biosimilar Pipeline Opportunity 
 CHS-1701 (Our Pegfilgrastim (Neulasta) Biosimilar Candidate) 
 Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, or G-CSF, is a protein that promotes the survival, proliferation (an increase in the number of cells due to cell growth and cell division) and differentiation of certain types of white blood cells known as neutrophils. Recombinant G-CSF therapies, such as filgrastim (Neupogen) and pegfilgrastim (Neulasta), are commonly used in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in cancer, which is characterized by an abnormally low level of neutrophils and other white blood cells that aid in the defense against infections. We selected pegfilgrastim as the development target for our biosimilar G-CSF product candidate for the following reasons:

• | Large market opportunity. The combined opportunity for both short- and long-acting G-CSF therapies worldwide is estimated to exceed $5 billion in 2017, and pegfilgrastim therapies are expected to capture over 70% of the worldwide G-CSF market. It is estimated that the worldwide opportunity for Neulasta, the reference product for CHS-1701, will exceed $4.5 billion in 2017.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Receptivity to biosimilars. We believe there is strong conviction among payors to drive biosimilar adoption in the G-CSF category. This is supported by the uptake of filgrastim biosimilars in the EU5 (Spain, Great Britain, France, Germany and Italy), which were initially launched in 2008 and achieved approximately a 60% share of the accessible short-acting G-CSF market and an approximately 85% share of the reference product market by the end of 2015. These percentage shares are based on sales of all short-acting G-CSF products in the EU5 measured in treatment days. The accessible short-acting G-CSF market is formed by Euprotin, Granocyte, Myelostim, Neutrogin, Neulasta (the reference product) and filgrastim biosimilars.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Timing of patent expiration. We believe that the expiration of certain originator patents pertaining to pegfilgrastim in major markets offers us a near-term opportunity to introduce biosimilar competitors in these markets. Specifically, we believe we have not been precluded by the originator’s patents from introducing a pegfilgrastim biosimilar candidate in the United States since October 2015 and would not be precluded in Europe after August 2017.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Product Overview 
 Neulasta, the reference product for CHS-1701, is a PEGylated form of the recombinant human G-CSF analog, filgrastim. Filgrastim produced from E. coli is not glycosylated. We have performed extensive analytical characterization of CHS-1701 and have determined that its basic and higher-order structures are similar to Neulasta. We have also performed in vitro characterization of the biological activity of CHS-1701. The biological effect of CHS-1701 on neutrophils was assessed by measuring the proliferation of NFS-60 cells that are commercially available hematopoietic cells (blood cells that give rise to other blood cells) of neutrophilic lineage expressing G-CSF receptors and have been used extensively for testing G-CSF products. The biological activity of CHS-1701 (proliferation of NFS-60 cells) is a consequence of its binding to G-CSF receptors expressed on NFS-60 cells, activation of this receptor and induction of the proliferation. We determined that CHS-1701 stimulated the proliferation of the NFS-60 cells in a manner consistent with that observed with Neulasta. 
 Neulasta is approved in the U.S. and Europe and is indicated as a treatment to reduce the incidence of infection, as manifested by febrile neutropenia, in patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anticancer drugs associated with a clinically significant incidence of febrile neutropenia. 
 Analysts project the worldwide market for Neulasta in 2017 will exceed $4.5 billion, of which approximately $3.7 billion would be in the U.S. We have concluded that patent expiration in major markets offers a near-term opportunity to introduce biosimilar competitors in the U.S. after October 2015 and in Europe after February 2018. 
 Current Development Status and Data
 Under the 351(k) (biosimilar) pathway, we have successfully submitted a BLA for CHS-1701 on August 9, 2016 and received a Biosimilar User Fee Act, or BSUFA, action date for this BLA from the FDA of June 9, 2017. In October 2016, we filed an MAA for European approval. The BLA and MAA submissions are supported by the successful completion of similarity data from analytical, PK, PD and immunogenicity studies comparing CHS-1701 and Neulasta. 
 Step 1: Cell Line Development and Manufacturing 
 As with our other product candidates, we confirmed that the amino acid sequence of CHS-1701 is identical to the originator molecule. CHS-1701 is manufactured in E. coli and PEGylation occurs as a subsequent step in the manufacturing process. For PEGylation of CHS-1701, we used the equivalent polyethylene glycol, or PEG, molecule as Neulasta and established that chemistry 
 9


and site of attachment of the PEG molecule was the same. In December 2015, we entered into a strategic manufacturing agreement with KBI Biopharma for long-term commercial manufacturing of CHS-1701.
 Step 2: Analytical Characterization and In Vitro Comparability 
 Filgrastim produced from E. coli is not glycosylated. We performed extensive analytical characterization of CHS-1701 and have determined its basic and higher-order structures are similar to Neulasta. We studied the in vitro activity of CHS-1701 in an assay measuring the proliferation of the murine myeloid leukemia cell line, NFS-60. CHS-1701 stimulated the proliferation of the NFS-60 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, consistent with the proliferation seen with Neulasta. 
Step 3: In Vivo Animal Comparability 
 With CHS-1701, we have performed two preclinical pharmacology/toxicology studies: a two-week study in rats and a four-week study in monkeys. We performed a two-week rat study to characterize the toxicity and pharmacodynamics of CHS-1701 administered every four days for two weeks, with a recovery period of one week compared to Neulasta. Doses ranged from 0.1 to 1.0 mg/kg. There was no mortality during the study and no systemic signs of toxicity could be attributed to treatment. There were no differences in clinical observations between the control and treated animals. Dose-proportional increases in absolute neutrophil count, or ANC, and total white blood cell count were observed at all dose levels of CHS-1701. Clinical chemistry findings and mild to moderate splenic enlargement in the CHS-1701-treated animals were consistent with the pharmacological effects of treatment with Neulasta. 
 We designed a second pharmacology/toxicology study in animals to characterize PK and PD profiles as well as the potential for harmful antibody responses to CHS-1701 or other toxic effects, in order to compare these attributes observed for CHS-1701 with those we observed for Neulasta. We administered either CHS-1701 or Neulasta at dose levels of 0.075, 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg once weekly for 4 weeks. We found that CHS-1701 performed in a manner similar to Neulasta in that it increased the production of white blood cells in the bone marrow and resulted in an increase in the amount of white blood cells in the blood, in the bone marrow and in lymphoid tissues such as spleen and thymus tissue. Moreover, we found no differences between CHS-1701 and Neulasta in terms of potentially harmful antibody responses or other toxicities, or in terms of PK and PD. 
 Step 4: Pivotal Phase 1 Human Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Study 
 While under the 351(a) (novel biologic) regulatory pathway, we conducted a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, single-dose, two-period crossover study to assess the PK profile, safety and activity of a single subcutaneous 6 mg dose of CHS-1701 compared to Neulasta in 79 healthy human subjects between November 2012 and March 2013. 
 This Phase 1 study met its primary endpoint for purposes of enabling us to pursue a 351(a) (novel biologic) approval pathway, but did not establish bioequivalence necessary to support a 351(k) (biosimilar) pathway. In October 2014, we met with the FDA to discuss our development plan for CHS-1701. We informed the agency of our decision to transition from a 351(a) (novel biologic) approval pathway to a 351(k) (biosimilar) approval pathway.
 Step 5: Further Studies Supporting 351(k) BLA Regulatory Filing. 
 In March 2015, we received written feedback from the FDA on our development plan for CHS-1701 and we initiated a pivotal PK/PD study for CHS-1701 under the 351(k) (biosimilar) pathway in the U.S. which completed in October 2015. This study met its primary PD endpoints. In terms of PK parameters, the study also met bioequivalence for C max. The AUC portion of the PK results did not meet bioequivalence due to the presence of a low, anomalous PK profile in the first treatment period Neulasta group. Although this PK/PD study could support the BLA, we initiated a follow-on PK/PD study in the first quarter of 2016 and successfully completed that study in July 2016. This second study, conducted under the 351(k) (biosimilar pathway), met all of its co-primary endpoints for PK, C max and AUC, and for PD, absolute neutrophil count (ANC max and ANC AUC). For both PK and PD endpoints, the 90% confidence intervals for the GMR were well contained within the pre-specified margins of 80% to 125%. This randomized, single-blind, three-sequence, three-period crossover study in healthy subjects assessed PK, PD, and safety (including immunogenicity) of a 6 mg subcutaneous (SC) injection of CHS-1701 compared to 6 mg SC dose of Neulasta. A total of 122 healthy volunteer subjects were randomized to one of three treatment sequences, each with three treatments (Neulasta/Neulasta/CHS-1701 or CHS-1701/Neulasta/Neulasta or Neulasta/CHS-1701/Neulasta). Subject inclusion criteria, procedures and study design, as well as other measures, reflected modifications addressing findings in the previous PK/PD study under the 351(k) (biosimilar) pathway, successfully decreasing subject variability and eliminating the extreme subject outliers previously observed. 
 10


In May 2015, we initiated an immunogenicity study in healthy volunteers pursuant to this BLA, which completed in January 2016 and met its primary endpoints. 
 We filed the BLA on August 9, 2016 and have a BSUFA action date of June 9, 2017. In October 2016, we filed an MAA for European approval, which was accepted in November 2016. 
 CHS-5217 (Our Bevacizumab (Avastin) Biosimilar Candidate) 
 Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks angiogenesis by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). VEGF-A is a protein that stimulates angiogenesis, which is the formation of blood vessels. In turn, the formation of new blood vessels may promote the growth of certain solid tissues, including solid tumors. Bevacizumab was first approved in 2004 by the FDA for combination use with standard chemotherapy for metastatic colon cancer. It has since been approved for use in certain lung cancers, renal cancers, ovarian cancers and glioblastoma.
 Bevacizumab achieved approximately $6.9 billion in worldwide sales in 2015 according to Evaluate Pharma. We selected Avastin as the biosimilar development target for our biosimilar, CHS-5217, for the following reasons: 
  
• | Large market opportunity. The combined opportunity for Avastin worldwide is estimated to exceed $6.7 billion in 2017, and forecasted to decrease to $5.6 billion in 2020, when biosimilar candidates of Avastin may be introduced to the market.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Channel synergy. We anticipate marketing CHS-5217 to many of the payors, hospitals and clinics that could contract for CHS-1701, and would aim to leverage a common sales force and commercial strategy for the oncology therapeutic area.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Timing of patent expiration. As part of a second wave of biosimilar candidates, we believe we would not be precluded by the originator’s patents from introducing a Avastin biosimilar candidate in the United States after July 2019.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Current Development Status and Data
 Step 1: Cell Line Development and Manufacturing
 We have identified the amino acid sequence of CHS-5217 and confirmed that it is identical to the reference product, Avastin. We established Master Cell Banks, or MCBs, and produced toxicology materials in the third quarter of 2015. We are currently transferring the manufacturing process to a U.S. contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, for clinical trial supply. 
Step 2: Analytical Characterization and In Vitro Comparability
 We demonstrated CHS-5217 similarity to Avastin with respect to key physicochemical properties that impact PK/PD, safety and efficacy using a broad spectrum of analytical methods. Through in vitro ligand and receptor binding studies, we have shown CHS-5217 to have highly similar pharmacological activity to Avastin.
 Step 3: In Vivo Animal Comparability
 We compared CHS-5217 to Avastin in a repeat dose study evaluating toxicity in cynomolgus monkeys and no appreciable differences were identified. We also completed a pharmacology study in ovarian carcinoma xenograft model in mice that demonstrated similar dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth between CHS-5217 and Avastin.
Immunology (Anti-TNF) Pipeline Opportunity 
 Tumor necrosis factor, or TNF, belongs to a family of soluble protein mediators, or cytokines, that play an important role in disease progression across a number of inflammatory and chronic conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn’s Disease, psoriasis and ulcerative colitis. Cytokines, such as TNF, are substances produced by cells in the body that can cause a biological effect on other cells in the body. TNF is generally understood as the “master regulator” of the body’s immune response and is the key initiator of immune-mediated inflammation in multiple organ systems. Several biologic agents have been developed that inhibit the inflammatory activity of TNF in the context of these diseases, which are collectively referred to as the anti-TNF class of therapeutics. Anti-TNF products with significant global sales include adalimumab (Humira), etanercept (Enbrel), infliximab (Remicade), golimumab (Simponi) and certolizumab pegol injection (Cimzia). These products share a common mechanism of action in that they inhibit TNF, but differ in their dosing schedules as well as the indications for which they are approved. Collectively, these treatments represent a significant revenue opportunity, with projected global sales in excess of $38 billion in 2017. 
 11


Our anti-TNF biosimilar product candidates, CHS-0214 and CHS-1420, are based on Enbrel and Humira, respectively. We selected these originator products as biosimilar development targets for the following principal reasons: 
  
• | Large market opportunity. Global sales of Enbrel and Humira are projected to exceed $27 billion in 2017, representing approximately 70% of combined estimated global sales in the anti-TNF monoclonal antibody and TNF inhibitor markets in 2017. In addition, among the top ten selling drugs in its pharmacological class, Humira is also approved for the largest number of inflammatory indications worldwide.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Receptivity to biosimilars. Because anti-TNF agents are typically used to treat diseases where there is low risk of imminent mortality, we believe physicians and payors will be inclined to support adoption of biosimilar anti-TNF agents that allow for rapid confirmation of safety and efficacy for the individual patient. We believe that physicians recognize the payor will be a key influencer in driving the adoption of biosimilar anti-TNF agents.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Technical barriers to entry. There are numerous challenges in the development of biosimilars to these reference products related to quality characteristics such as glycosylation that we believe our specialized expertise in protein chemistry and process science will allow us to overcome.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Timing of patent expiration. The expiration of certain originator patents pertaining to Enbrel and Humira in major markets offers us a near-term opportunity to introduce biosimilar competitors in these markets. Specifically, we believe we are not precluded by the originator’s patents from introducing an Enbrel biosimilar candidate in Europe or Japan. In the case of Humira, we do not believe originator patents would preclude us from introducing a biosimilar in the United States after December 2016, in Europe after October 2018 and in Japan after August 2018 (for rheumatoid arthritis) or May 2020 (for psoriasis).

CHS-0214 (Our Etanercept (Enbrel) Biosimilar Candidate) 
 Product Overview 
 Enbrel, the reference product for CHS-0214, is a complex fusion protein that combines the protein for tumor necrosis factor receptor 2, or TNFR-2, to another protein (called IgG1 Fc) which enables the fusion protein to attach to cells in the body. The TNFR-2 portion of the fusion protein binds to soluble and cell bound tumor necrosis factors alpha and beta, or TNF-α and TNF-ß, respectively, and inhibits TNF-α and TNF-ß from binding to cell surface proteins that recognize them. Autoimmune diseases are caused by an overactive immune response. Enbrel treats these diseases by inhibiting TNF-α, thus inhibiting the inflammatory cytokine cascade, which is a sequence of events in the body, caused by cytokines, leading to inflammation in a tissue or organ. 
 Enbrel has been approved by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and the FDA for the treatment of the following indications: 
  
• | rheumatoid arthritis;
--+----------------------


• | juvenile idiopathic arthritis;
--+-------------------------------


• | psoriatic arthritis;
--+---------------------


• | ankylosing spondylitis; and
--+----------------------------


• | psoriasis.
--+-----------

 Enbrel has been approved by the Japanese Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) for the treatment of the following indications only when conventional therapies are not sufficiently effective: 
  
• | rheumatoid arthritis; and
--+--------------------------


• | juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
--+-------------------------------

 In 2017, sales of Enbrel are projected to exceed approximately $8 billion worldwide. Because patents in the United States, assuming validity and enforceability, provide market exclusivity for the Enbrel originator molecule until 2029, we focused our CHS-0214 regulatory program on Europe and Japan, but harmonized as needed for potential FDA approval. We have licensed CHS-0214 to Daiichi Sankyo in Japan. We have licensed CHS-0214 to Orox for certain Caribbean and Latin American countries. According to Evaluate Pharma, in 2017, sales of Enbrel in Europe, Japan and other territories outside the United States are projected to be approximately $3.2 billion.

Current Development Status and Data 
 We have successfully advanced CHS-0214 through steps 1 through 5 of biosimilar drug development. Our pivotal Phase 1 human PK/PD study was conducted in the U.S. We evaluated CHS-0214 in two randomized Phase 3 clinical trials in patients with psoriasis and in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, both of which met their primary endpoints in November 2015 and January 2016, respectively. We expect to file a European marketing application for CHS-0214 with the EMA in the first half of 2017. If approved, we believe we will be able to extrapolate the data from our trials in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis to gain approval for CHS-0214 in all the indications included in the label for Enbrel.
Step 1: Cell Line Development and Manufacturing 
 We have identified the amino acid sequence of CHS-0214 and confirmed that it is identical to the reference product, Enbrel. We established Master Cell Banks, or MCBs, and Working Cell Banks, or WCBs, and produced toxicology materials in the third quarter of 2012 and Phase 1 study materials at a U.S. contract manufacturing organization, or CMO. We then transferred the manufacturing process to a European CMO for Phase 3 clinical trial supply and to another European CMO for subsequent commercialization. 
Step 2: Analytical Characterization and In Vitro Comparability 
 We demonstrated CHS-0214 similarity to Enbrel with respect to key physicochemical properties that determine PK/PD, safety and efficacy using a broad spectrum of analytical methods. Through in vitro receptor binding studies, including Fc receptors, complement (C1q) and Fc-mediated functional activities (i.e., antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, or ADCC, and complement-dependent cytotoxicity, or CDC), we have shown CHS-0214 to have highly similar pharmacological activity to Enbrel. ADCC and CDC refer to biological mechanisms of immune system defense which facilitate the body’s ability to use its immune system to target and destroy a given target cell. Comparing the effects of CHS-0214 and Enbrel on these mechanisms provides us a basis for determining how similar CHS-0214 is to Enbrel in terms of pharmacological activity. 
Step 3: In Vivo Animal Comparability 
 We compared CHS-0214 to Enbrel in a single-dose PK study and a 28-day study in evaluating toxicity and PK in cynomolgus monkeys and no appreciable differences were identified. 
Step 4: Pivotal Phase 1 Human Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Study 
 We announced the Phase 1 PK similarity study results for CHS-0214 in October 2013. This study was a single dose cross-over study conducted in 60 healthy adult human volunteers to evaluate the PK and safety of CHS-0214 compared to Enbrel. CHS-0214 met the primary endpoint of clinical PK similarity to Enbrel with the study demonstrating a 98% correlation between CHS-0214 and Enbrel. We also collected safety data in all subjects and both CHS-0214 and Enbrel were well tolerated. Treatment emergent adverse events were similar for each treatment and treatment period, and there were no unusual or unexpected or serious adverse events related to either product. There were no clinically meaningful differences in other safety parameters observed during this study. 
 Due to the change in the manufacturing location from the U.S. to the E.U., we conducted an additional Phase 1 PK similarity study comparing CHS-0214 to a lot of Enbrel manufactured in Europe, which met its primary endpoint in April 2015. The design of this study was a single-dose, cross-over study similar to the one described above. 
 In 2016, we initiated a Phase 1 PK bioequivalence study comparing E.U. Enbrel to CHS-0214 produced under a new process and also initiated a Phase 1 PK comparability study comparing CHS-0214 produced under a new process and CHS-0214 under a former process and used in the two Phase 3 trials. We completed these two studies in October 2016. The Phase 1 PK bioequivalence study achieved the primary PK bioequivalence endpoint, as the 90% confidence intervals for the GMR for the two groups was within 80% to 125% for all PK parameters. The Phase 1 PK comparability study provided additional relative bioavailability data for CHS-0214.
 Step 5: Phase 3 Confirmatory Safety and Efficacy Clinical Trials
 We announced the dosing of the first patient in a Phase 3 rheumatoid arthritis clinical trial in June 2014, and subsequently initiated a separate Phase 3 clinical trial in psoriasis in July 2014. The design of each Phase 3 clinical trial reflects guidance from regulatory agencies regarding key study parameters. 
 The Phase 3 clinical trial in rheumatoid arthritis was designed as a double blind, multi-center, parallel group study in which patients with DMARD (disease-modifying antirheumatic drug)-refractory active rheumatoid arthritis were put on a stable dose of 
 13


methotrexate. This trial enrolled 647 subjects who were randomized 1:1 to CHS-0214 50 mg or Enbrel 50 mg, administered subcutaneously weekly over a period of 24 weeks. Following the initial 24-week double-blind period, all patients were moved to a CHS-0214 treatment for a period of 6 months. In January 2016, the trial met its primary end-point of the proportion of subjects achieving ACR20 (20% improvement according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria) at 24 weeks, which was within the pre-specified margins for demonstrating equivalence of CHS-0214 compared to Enbrel. There were no clinically meaningful differences in the safety and immunogenicity profiles of the two products.
 The Phase 3 clinical trial in psoriasis was designed as a double-blind, parallel group, multi-center study in patients with active psoriasis. This trial enrolled 521 patients who were randomized 1:1 to CHS-0214 or Enbrel, 50 mg administered subcutaneously twice weekly for the first 12 weeks, switching to once weekly and continuing in the same treatment arms for an additional 40 weeks, which included four weeks of follow-up. In November 2015, this trial met its primary efficacy endpoint of mean percent change in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, or PASI, from baseline and the proportion of subjects achieving a 75% improvement in the PASI from baseline (PASI-75), scores at 12 weeks.
 In July 2015, we initiated an open-label, safety extension study (OLSES) evaluating the longer-term safety and durability of response of subjects who completed 48 weeks in the confirmatory safety and efficacy Phase 3 trials of CHS-0214 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. We enrolled 359 subjects in this study. 
 CHS-1420 (Our Adalimumab (Humira) Biosimilar Candidate) 
 Product Overview 
 Humira, which is the reference product, or originator, for CHS-1420, is a monoclonal antibody that can bind to a substance in the body known as tumor necrosis factor, or TNF, thereby inhibiting the known effect of this substance as a potent mediator of inflammation. Humira thus provides a therapeutic benefit for treatment of various inflammatory diseases characterized by increased production of TNF in the body. However, it has also been demonstrated that Humira can bind to receptors on white blood cells which may lessen the ability of the body’s immune system to fight infection. 
 Humira has been approved by the EMA and the FDA for the treatment of the following indications only when conventional therapies are not sufficiently effective: 
  
• | rheumatoid arthritis;
--+----------------------


• | juvenile idiopathic arthritis;
--+-------------------------------


• | psoriatic arthritis;
--+---------------------


• | ankylosing spondylitis;
--+------------------------


• | Crohn’s Disease;
--+-----------------


• | ulcerative colitis; and
--+------------------------


• | psoriasis.
--+-----------

 Humira has been approved by the PMDA for the treatment of the following indications only when conventional therapies are not sufficiently effective: 
  
• | rheumatoid arthritis;
--+----------------------


• | psoriatic arthritis;
--+---------------------


• | psoriasis; and
--+---------------


• | Behçet’s Disease.
--+------------------

 Worldwide sales of Humira are projected to exceed $18 billion in 2017, with about $12 billion in the United States and $3.9 billion in Europe, the two primary regions in which we plan to focus our commercialization efforts. CHS-1420 will target a large global anti-TNF market, including but not limited to the worldwide market for the originator product, Humira. According to Evaluate Pharma, in 2017, sales of Humira worldwide and of Enbrel in the United States are projected to exceed $23 billion.

Current Development Status and Data 
 We have successfully advanced CHS-1420 through steps 1 through 5 of biosimilar drug development. In August 2014, we completed a pivotal Phase 1 PK/PD study comparing CHS-1420 to Humira in healthy volunteers. This Phase 1 PK study met the primary endpoint and demonstrated bioequivalence for all prospectively defined endpoints and was conducted under an IND application in the U.S. In August 2015, we initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial in psoriasis and announced positive 12-week data from that trial in August 2016, followed by confirmatory positive 24-week results in January 2017, to support the planned filing of a marketing application in the U.S. and the E.U. in the first half of 2017. We completed a Phase 1 PK bridging study comparing our Phase 3 material to U.S. manufactured Humira in March 2017. In January 2017, we initiated a PK study bridging to E.U. manufactured Humira and a PK study comparing U.S. Humira to E.U. Humira. We reached concurrence with regulatory authorities in the U.S. and Europe with the objective of designing a harmonized global Phase 3 program to support registration in these territories. If approved, we believe we will be able to extrapolate the data from our trial in psoriasis to gain approval for CHS-1420 in all the indications included in the label for Humira.
Step 1: Cell Line Development and Manufacturing 
 As with all our molecules, we matched the amino acid sequence of CHS-1420 to the originator molecule (Humira) prior to development and demonstrated it to be identical. We established Master Cell Banks, or MCBs, and Working Cell Banks, or WCBs, and transferred the manufacturing process to a U.S. CMO for manufacturing of Phase 1 study and Phase 3 clinical trial supplies. 
Step 2: Analytical Characterization and In Vitro Comparability 
 We accomplished characterization of CHS-1420 and Humira by a multi-dimensional analytical study, demonstrating a high degree of similarity between CHS-1420 and Humira. Through extensive biochemical, biophysical and biological analysis we have shown that CHS-1420 has a structure and in vitro activity similar to that of Humira with respect to primary sequence (the linear sequence of the amino acids in the protein), protein folding (the structure of the protein in three dimensions which is critical to its biological function) and charge profiles (the overall electrical charge characteristic of the protein resulting from the electrical charges of its constituent amino acids), as well as the protein’s glycosylation profile and potency. 
 We have also shown CHS-1420 to be highly similar to Humira through in vitro receptor binding studies, specifically in its ability to inhibit TNF-a mediated cell death. In all of these studies we demonstrated CHS-1420 to have similar pharmacological activity to Humira by evaluating the binding of both CHS-1420 and, Humira to Fc receptors, complement (C1q) and Fc-mediated functional activities: ADCC and CDC. 
 Step 3: In Vivo Animal Comparability 
 We conducted two nonclinical studies in monkeys in order to compare the PK and nonclinical safety profile of CHS-1420 to Humira. Following one month of repeat dosing, we determined the pharmacokinetics of CHS-1420 to be similar to that of Humira. 
Step 4: Pivotal Phase 1 Human Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Study 
 In April 2014, we initiated a Phase 1 pivotal PK study in human subjects. This is a single dose, double-blind parallel group study designed to demonstrate bioequivalence between CHS-1420 and Humira. A secondary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of CHS-1420 in this population. The study has been successfully completed and met the primary endpoint and demonstrated bioequivalence with respect to the three prospectively defined PK endpoints. CHS-1420 and Humira were both well tolerated in this single-dose study in healthy adult volunteers. 
 We completed a Phase 1 PK bridging study comparing our Phase 3 material to U.S. manufactured Humira in March 2017.
 Step 5: Phase 3 Confirmatory Safety and Efficacy Clinical Trials 
 In August 2015, we initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial in psoriasis that enrolled 545 subjects. This is a confirmatory, randomized, double-blind, active-control, parallel-group, three-part study in patients with active, moderate to severe, chronic plaque psoriasis. This trial met its primary endpoint demonstrating similarity between CHS-1420 and Humira with respect to percentage of subjects achieving the PASI-75 scores at 12 weeks. Both CHS-1420 and Humira were similarly well tolerated with similar safety profiles. In part two of this trial, from week 16 to week 24, half the subjects randomized to Humira crossed-over to CHS-1420, modeling a chronic patient’s transition to a biosimilar. In January 2017, we reported that maintenance of PASI-75 was similar across the three subsequent treatment groups: CHS-1420 followed by CHS-1420, Humira followed by CHS-1420, and Humira followed by Humira. CHS-1420 and Humira 
 15


were similarly well tolerated in all groups during part two of the trial. In part three of the trial, all subjects will receive CHS-1420 for an additional 24 weeks. This trial would be considered the primary confirmatory safety and efficacy trial to support a registration filing.
 Ophthalmology Pipeline Opportunity 
 CHS-3351 (Our Ranibizumab (Lucentis) Biosimilar Candidate) 
 Lucentis is a monoclonal antibody fragment (Fab) created from the same parent mouse antibody as bevacizumab and produced through a microbial culture. It is an anti-angiogenic that has been first approved to treat age-related wet macular degeneration, or AMD. Like bevacizumab Lucentis blocks angiogenesis by inhibiting VEGF-A.
 According to Evaluate Pharma, Lucentis achieved approximately $3.3 billion in worldwide sales in 2016, and is expected to decrease to approximately $2.5 billion in 2020, when the composition of matter patent on ranibizumab expires in the United States. We selected Lucentis as the biosimilar development target for our biosimilar, CHS-3351, to leverage the analytics deployed on bevacizumab and because we could address a concentrated market where we believe we can focus resources and establish a therapeutic franchise. 
 Current Development Status and Data
 Step 1: Cell Line Development and Manufacturing
 We have identified the amino acid sequence of CHS-3351 and confirmed that it is identical to the reference product, Lucentis. We are currently establishing Master Cell Banks, or MCBs, as well as Working Cell Banks, or WCBs. We are currently transferring the manufacturing process to a U.S. CMO for production of material to supply toxicology studies and clinical trials. 
Early-Stage Biosimilar Pipeline  
 We are continuously performing product opportunity reviews of additional biosimilar pipeline candidates in conjunction with our scientific advisory board and we plan to submit one or two new investigational new drug (IND) applications per year. 
Small Molecule Therapeutic Candidate in Development
 CHS-131 is a novel, first-in-class, well-tolerated, once-daily oral drug candidate for multiple sclerosis (MS) patients which has anti-inflammatory activity in the central nervous system (CNS) and crosses the blood-brain barrier. In June 2016, we announced that a study with CHS-131 in treatment-naïve, relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) subjects demonstrated approximately a 50% decrease in the incidence of new contrast-enhancing (CE) lesions over six months when compared to placebo. CHS-131 was generally well-tolerated and without evidence of immune suppression or the side-effects commonly seen in other oral multiple MS therapies. This Phase 2b trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study that evaluated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of two orally administered doses (3 mg and 1 mg daily) of CHS-131 against placebo for six months in 227 subjects with RRMS. The primary endpoint of the trial was the reduction in the cumulative number of total CE lesions determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from baseline to week 24 of study treatment, a standard endpoint for Phase 2 trials in RRMS. Subjects were assessed clinically and by MRI monthly for six months. All MRIs were read in a blinded fashion at a U.S. imaging center. Patients on CHS-131 experienced a statistically significant reduction in CE lesions that was dose dependent, with the 3 mg dose resulting in a 52% reduction in CE lesions with a p-value of 0.003 compared to placebo. We are currently exploring out licensing opportunities for this asset.  Sales and Marketing 
 Our strategy entails licensing our oncology product rights outside of the U.S. to commercially proficient entities, while retaining U.S. rights to commercialization. Because the sales call points for our clinical stage oncology assets (CHS-1701 and CHS-5217) in the U.S. are highly concentrated and addressable by a relatively small commercial organization, the preservation of U.S. rights allows us the flexibility to cost effectively build our own commercial capability.
 For our other biosimilar and small molecule drug candidates (CHS-0214, CHS-1420, CHS-3351 and CHS-131), we seek to license rights regionally or globally to commercially proficient partners.

Manufacturing 
 We have entered into agreements with several CMOs for the manufacture and clinical drug supply for our lead products candidates. We continue to screen other contract manufacturers to meet our clinical, commercial and regulatory supply requirements on a product-by-product basis. In December 2015, we entered into a strategic commercial supply agreement with KBI Biopharma for the supply of CHS-1701. For a discussion of risks related to our sources and availability of supplies, please see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Ability to Hire Highly Qualified Personnel and Our Reliance on Third Parties.”
Competition 
 The development and commercialization of protein-based therapeutics is highly competitive. While we believe that our biologics platform, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources. Such competition includes larger and better-funded pharmaceutical, generic pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as originator companies and any other firms developing the biosimilars that would compete with the product candidates in our pipeline and other novel products with similar indications. 
 CHS-1701 may face competition from Amgen (which holds rights to Neulasta, the reference product of CHS-1701), Sandoz, Apotex Inc., or Apotex, Pfizer, Mylan N.V., or Mylan, and Teva. CHS-0214 may compete with products developed by Pfizer, (which holds ex-North America rights to Enbrel, the reference product of CHS-0214), Sandoz (which has an FDA-approved biosimilar to Enbrel (ErelziTM)), Samsung Bioepis Co Ltd., or Samsung Bioepis, which has an EMA-approved biosimilar to Enbrel (BenepaliTM),  and LG Chem, Ltd., or LG. CHS-1420 may face competition from AbbVie (the holder of rights to Humira, the reference product of CHS-1420), Amgen (which has an FDA-approved biosimilar to Humira (AmjevitaTM)), Sandoz, Samsung Bioepis, Pfizer, Mylan, Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Momenta, Fujifilm Kyowa Kirin Biologics Co., Ltd or Fujifilm, and Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, or Boehringer Ingelheim.
 Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and commercializing those treatments. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we are in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ treatments may be more effective or more effectively marketed and sold than any treatment we may commercialize and may render our treatments obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates. 
 Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and subject registration for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to or necessary for our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
 We expect any products that we develop and commercialize directly or with partners to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. 
 Collaboration and License Agreements 
 License Agreement with Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited 
 In January 2012, we entered into a license agreement with Daiichi Sankyo for the development and commercialization of certain biosimilar products in certain territories. We granted to Daiichi Sankyo an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to develop, commercialize and use biosimilar versions of etanercept (Enbrel) and rituximab (Rituxan) for the treatment of human diseases and conditions in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. Daiichi Sankyo has an option, exercisable only within a certain time period, to obtain an exclusive license to develop and commercialize certain biosimilar products in China. Daiichi Sankyo also has an option, exercisable at any time during the term of the agreement, to obtain a license to manufacture licensed products to support development and commercialization of licensed products in the licensed territory, on a product-by-product basis. Prior to Daiichi Sankyo’s exercise of its manufacturing option, we are responsible for manufacturing and supplying to Daiichi Sankyo licensed products pursuant to a manufacturing and supply agreement to be entered under the terms of this agreement. 
 17


In May 2012, Daiichi Sankyo terminated its licensed rights, solely as to CHS-0214, in Taiwan and South Korea. In August 2012, Daiichi Sankyo declined its right to expand the territory to include China. In July 2014, Daiichi Sankyo terminated all of its licensed rights to a biosimilar rituximab product. 
 Upon execution of the agreement, we received an upfront payment in cash of $10.0 million and $20.0 million in the form of an equity investment. We are eligible to receive from Daiichi Sankyo tiered royalties based on a percentage of net sales of licensed products in the licensed territory ranging from the low double digits to high teens, on a product-by-product basis. If we are manufacturing product, we are eligible to receive an incremental royalty reflecting our manufacturing costs for each licensed product which, when combined with the base royalty, will result in royalties equal to a percentage of net sales of licensed products ranging from the low- to high-twenties, on a product-by-product basis. 
 Our agreement with Daiichi Sankyo will expire on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis ten years after receipt of regulatory approval for such product in such country, subject to possible three-year extensions at Daiichi Sankyo’s sole discretion, if Daiichi Sankyo is then manufacturing the relevant product, or otherwise by mutual agreement of the parties, based on the approval of a commercial plan in the year before such extension would take effect. Either party may terminate the agreement for any material breach by the other party that is not cured within a specified time period. Prior to commercialization, Daiichi Sankyo may terminate the agreement on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis within specific time periods after achieving certain development milestones only if Daiichi Sankyo concludes, in good faith, that the product is not commercially viable, there are material safety, efficacy or tolerability issues that cannot be overcome or that there would be difficulties caused by internal or portfolio reasons. After commencement of commercialization, Daiichi Sankyo may terminate the agreement on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis with one year’s prior written notice to us only if Daiichi Sankyo concludes, in good faith, that the product is not commercially viable, that there are material safety, efficacy or tolerability issues that cannot be overcome or that there are difficulties caused by internal or portfolio reasons. Either party may terminate the agreement upon bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party, and we may terminate the agreement if Daiichi Sankyo challenges the licensed patents. 
 License Agreement with Baxalta Incorporated, Baxalta US Inc., and Baxalta GmbH 
 We entered into a license agreement in August 2013 and two subsequent amendments thereto with Baxalta Incorporated, Baxalta US Inc., and Baxalta GmbH, collectively Baxalta (then Baxter International, Inc., part of Shire plc, or Shire, as of June 2016), to develop and commercialize an etanercept biosimilar molecule, CHS-0214, worldwide, excluding the U.S., Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, China and most of the Caribbean and South American nations (as amended, the “Baxalta Agreement”). On September 26, 2016, Shire issued a termination notice of the Baxalta Agreement, in its entirety as part of its strategic portfolio review after its acquisition of Baxalta. Under the Baxalta Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $30.0 million and were eligible to receive up to $335.3 million in contingent payments, of which we actually received $215.3 million. Upon the termination of the Baxalta Agreement, we regained from Shire all development and commercial rights previously licensed under the Baxalta Agreement.
Distribution Agreement with Orox Pharmaceuticals B.V. 
 In December 2012, we entered into a distribution agreement with Orox Pharmaceuticals B.V., or Orox, for the commercialization of biosimilar versions of etanercept (Enbrel), rituximab (Rituxan), adalimumab (Humira) and pegfilgrastim (Neulasta). Under this agreement, we granted to Orox an exclusive license to commercialize the products for the treatment of human diseases and conditions in certain Caribbean and Latin American countries. Under this agreement, Orox has an option, exercisable within a defined time period, to obtain an exclusive license to commercialize certain additional biosimilar products in the same field and territory. We are obligated to manufacture and supply licensed products to Orox. 
 We are obligated to develop licensed products and achieve regulatory approval for such products outside of the Caribbean and Latin American countries covered by the agreement by specified dates in order to support Orox’s activities under the agreement in its licensed territory. We are eligible to receive from Orox a share of gross profits in the low 20 percent range from the sale of licensed products, on a product-by-product basis. 
 Our agreement with Orox will expire on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis ten years after regulatory approval of such product in such country, subject to automatic three-year extensions unless Orox notifies us in writing at least 18 months in advance of the date upon which the term would otherwise expire that it does not wish to extend the term for such product in such country. Either party may terminate the agreement for material breach by the other party that is not cured within a specified time period. Orox may terminate the Agreement for convenience on a product-by-product basis at any time upon 12-months prior written notice. Either party may terminate the agreement upon bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party, and we may terminate the agreement immediately upon written notice to Orox if Orox challenges the licensed patents or commits a breach of specified provisions of the agreement.

License Agreement with Genentech, Inc. 
 In July 2013, we entered into a license agreement with Genentech, under which we obtained a royalty-bearing, non-exclusive, sublicensable license under a family of patents, commonly referred to as the Cabilly patents, to manufacture, use and commercialize products containing antibodies that bind to TNF-a. In consideration for the rights granted to us under the agreement, we made a cash upfront payment to Genentech and are required to make a payment of $5.0 million based upon achievement of a regulatory milestone. We will also be required to pay tiered royalties on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed patents ranging from the low- to mid-single digits. 
 We may terminate the agreement at any time upon sixty days prior written notice to Genentech. Genentech may terminate the agreement for any material breach by us that is not cured within a specified time period or in the event of our insolvency. Genentech may also terminate the agreement if we challenge the licensed patents. Absent earlier termination, the agreement with Genentech will expire on a country-by-country basis on the expiration of the last valid patent claim. 
 License Agreements with Selexis SA 
 In April 2011 and June 2012, we entered into license agreements with Selexis SA, or Selexis, under which Selexis granted to us royalty-bearing, non-exclusive, sublicensable licenses under Selexis’s intellectual property rights to manufacture, use and commercialize two of our biosimilar products using Selexis cell lines. In consideration for the rights granted to us under the agreements, we made cash upfront payments to Selexis and are required to make payments based upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones for such biosimilar products, totaling up to €210,000 for each of the two products, or a total aggregate amount of €420,000. In addition, we are also required to pay a royalty as a percentage of revenue on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis in the low-single digits. 
 We may terminate each agreement at any time upon sixty days written notice to Selexis. Either we or Selexis may terminate an agreement for any material breach by the other party that is not cured within a specified time period or in the event of the other party’s insolvency. Absent earlier termination, the agreements with Selexis terminate on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis on the expiration of the last-to-expire or lapse of the valid patent claims covering such product in such country. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to avoid infringing the proprietary rights of third parties, our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our technologies where applicable and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our proprietary technologies by, among other methods, filing U.S. and international patent applications on these technologies, inventions and improvements that are important to our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the U.S., the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the U.S., a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. 
 In the normal course of business, we pursue patent protection for inventions related to our product candidates, including protein manufacture and formulation inventions. We own a portfolio of issued and pending patent applications pertaining to our product candidates. We have 166 pending patent applications, and six issued patents, in the U.S. and in other countries, related to formulations and manufacture of CHS-0214. These patents and patent applications, if granted, are expected to expire in 2032, 2033 and 2035. We have 46 pending patent applications, and four issued patents, in the U.S. and in other countries related to CHS-1420. These patents and patent applications, if granted, are expected to expire in 2033, 2035, and 2036.
 We have non-exclusive licenses from Selexis under patents and patent applications granted or filed in the U.S. and other countries that cover Selexis’s recombinant cell line technology in two families. One family of patents is directed to methods for transfecting eukaryotic cells with nucleic acid vectors using Matrix Attachment Regions, or MARs, elements to increase stable and transient transfection efficiency. The second family of patents is related to purified and isolated DNA sequences having protein production increasing activity and to the use of MARs for increasing protein production activity in a eukaryotic cell. The licensed patents are expected to expire between 2023 and 2026. 
 19


We have a non-exclusive license from Genentech under two U.S. patents which are commonly known as the “Cabilly” patents. The Cabilly patents cover key steps of therapeutic antibody manufacturing methods. One of the Cabilly patent covers a process for producing an immunoglobulin molecule (Ig) in a single host cell; the second Cabilly patent covers a method for making an antibody heavy chain and antibody light chain in a recombinant host cell. Both licensed patents are expected to expire in December 2018. 
 To date we have not licensed any patents from Daiichi Sankyo. 
 We do not know whether any of the pending patent applications described above will result in the issuance of any patents or whether the rights granted under any patents issuing from these applications will prevent any of our competitors from marketing similar products that may be competitive with our own. Moreover, even if we do obtain issued patents, they will not guarantee us the right to use our patented technology for commercialization of our product candidates. Third parties may have blocking patents that could prevent us from commercializing our own products, even if our products use or embody our own, patented inventions. 
 The validity and enforceability of patents are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Any patents that may issue on our pending applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing products similar to ours. Furthermore, our competitors may develop similar or alternative technologies not covered by any patents that may issue to us. 
 In a merger completed February 12, 2014, we acquired InteKrin Therapeutics Inc., or InteKrin. InteKrin is developing a small molecule peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, or PPAR, gamma agonist, CHS-131, for the treatment of MS which we believe may be complementary with one or more biologic therapeutics for MS we are currently evaluating as a potential candidate for inclusion in our pipeline of biosimilar products. InteKrin is the exclusive licensee of certain U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications owned by Amgen, covering the specific PPAR gamma agonist molecule that InteKrin is developing. InteKrin also owns pending patent filings related to this PPAR gamma agonist. 
 InteKrin has an exclusive license from Amgen under 120 patents and patent applications granted or filed in the U.S. and other countries that cover PPAR gamma modulating molecules and therapeutic product compositions that are expected to expire in 2020 and 2021, as well as certain salt forms and polymorphic forms of PPAR gamma modulating molecules that are expected to expire in 2024 (with possible Hatch-Waxman patent term extension). Additionally, InteKrin owns 35 patents and patent applications granted or filed in the U.S. and other countries that cover solid forms of PPAR gamma agonist pharmaceutical compositions, and methods of treating disorders including diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or lipodystrophy. These patents and patent applications, if granted, are expected to expire in 2031, 2034 and 2036.
 For technologies for which we do not seek patent protection, we may rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary position. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our technology and product candidates, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including our employees, consultants, advisors, contractors or collaborators. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For a discussion of risks related to our proprietary technology and processes, please see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Intellectual Property.” 
 Regulatory 
 Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 Government authorities at the federal, state and local level in the U.S. and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the U.S. and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
FDA Approval Process 
 All of our current product candidates are subject to regulation in the U.S. by the FDA as biological products, or biologics. The FDA subjects biologics to extensive pre- and post-market regulation. The Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, the Federal Food, 
 20


Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of biologics. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending BLAs, withdrawal of approvals, clinical holds, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal penalties. 
 The PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the U.S. and between states. 
 The process required by the FDA before a new biologic may be marketed in the U.S. is long, expensive and inherently uncertain. Biologics development in the U.S. typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the biologic for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Developing the data to satisfy FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. 
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies, although the IND must also include the results of preclinical testing and animal testing assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
 An IND must become effective before U.S. clinical trials may begin. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If during the 30-day waiting period the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical studies, the sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical studies can begin. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug or biologic to healthy volunteers or patients with the condition under investigation, all under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
 The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements or may impose other conditions. The study sponsor may also suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a determination that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 
 Abbreviated Licensure Pathway of Biological Products as Biosimilar under 351(k) 
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, amended the PHSA and created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The BPCIA attempts to minimize duplicative testing and thereby lower development costs and increase patient access to affordable treatments. For example, in contrast to the 351(a) (novel biologic) approval pathway discussed above, our experience to date with the FDA indicates that an application for licensure of a biosimilar product under the 351(k) (biosimilar) approval pathway may proceed on the basis of only two clinical study phases (typically termed Phase 1 and Phase 3) with supporting analytical and animal studies, as compared with the requirement for three study phases under the 351(a) (novel biologics) approval pathway. Thus, under the 351(k) (biosimilar) 
 21


approval pathway, an application for licensure of a biosimilar product must include information demonstrating biosimilarity based upon the following, unless the FDA determines otherwise: 
  
• | analytical studies demonstrating that the proposed biosimilar product is highly similar to the approved product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | animal studies (including the assessment of toxicity); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | two clinical study phases: first, a clinical study or studies (generally termed “Phase 1”) that demonstrate the pharmacokinetic similarity (e.g. bioequivalence study) of the proposed biosimilar to the originator molecule, and second, a clinical study or studies (generally termed “Phase 3”) that demonstrate the safety (including immunogenicity), purity and that potency is statistically not inferior to that of the originator in one or more conditions for which the reference product is licensed and intended to be used.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, an application submitted under the 351(k) pathway must include information demonstrating that: 
  
• | the proposed biosimilar product and reference product utilize the same mechanism of action for the condition(s) of use prescribed, recommended or suggested in the proposed labeling, but only to the extent the mechanism(s) of action are known for the reference product;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended or suggested in the labeling for the proposed biosimilar product have been previously approved for the reference product;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the route of administration, the dosage form and the strength of the proposed biosimilar product are the same as those for the reference product; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the facility in which the biological product is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure that the biological product continues to be safe, pure and potent.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Biosimilarity, as defined in PHSA §351(i), means that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity and potency of the product. In addition, section 351(k)(4) of the PHSA provides for a designation of “interchangeability” between the reference and biosimilar products, whereby the biosimilar may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product. The higher standard of interchangeability must be demonstrated by information sufficient to show that: 
  
• | the proposed product is biosimilar to the reference product;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | the proposed product is expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | for a product that is administered more than once to an individual, the risk to the patient in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the biosimilar and the reference product is no greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 FDA approval is required before a biosimilar may be marketed in the U.S. However, complexities associated with the large and intricate structures of biological products and the process by which such products are manufactured pose significant hurdles to the FDA’s implementation of the 351(k) approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA. For example, the FDA has discretion over the kind and amount of scientific evidence — laboratory, preclinical and/or clinical — required to demonstrate biosimilarity to a licensed biological product. The FDA intends to consider the totality of the evidence, provided by a sponsor to support a demonstration of biosimilarity, and recommends that sponsors use a stepwise approach in the development of their biosimilar products. Biosimilar product applications thus may not be required to duplicate the entirety of preclinical and clinical testing used to establish the underlying safety and effectiveness of the reference product. However, the FDA may refuse to approve a biosimilar application if there is insufficient information to show that the active ingredients are the same or to demonstrate that any impurities or differences in active ingredients do not affect the safety, purity or potency of the biosimilar product. In addition, as with BLAs, biosimilar product applications will not be approved unless the product is manufactured in facilities designed to assure and preserve the biological product’s safety, purity and potency. 
 The submission of an application via the 351(k) pathway does not guarantee that the FDA will accept the application for filing and review, as the FDA may refuse to accept applications that it finds are incomplete. The FDA will treat a biosimilar application or supplement as incomplete if, among other reasons, any applicable user fees assessed under the Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 have not been paid. In addition, the FDA may accept an application for filing but deny approval on the basis that the sponsor has not demonstrated biosimilarity, in which case the sponsor may choose to conduct further analytical, preclinical or clinical studies to demonstrate such biosimilarity under section 351(k) or submit a BLA for licensure as a new biological product under section 351(a) of 
 22


the PHSA. For example, the potential for different regulatory outcomes depending on the selected approval pathway has been illustrated in connection with our development program for CHS-1701. At the outset of our development effort for this product candidate, we elected to proceed under the 351(a) (novel biologic) approval pathway. However, although our Phase 1 PK/PD trial for CHS-1701 met its primary endpoint and was satisfactory for purposes of pursuing the 351(a) (novel biologic) approval pathway (which does not require bioequivalence to the originator drug), the trial did not establish bioequivalence to Neulasta sufficient to support the 351(k) (biosimilar) approval pathway. In March 2015, we received written feedback from the FDA on our development plan for CHS-1701 and completed two PK/PD studies under the 351(k) (biosimilar) pathway and received acceptance of our BLA for CHS-1701 in October 2016.
 The timing of final FDA approval of a biosimilar for commercial distribution depends on a variety of factors, including whether the manufacturer of the branded product is entitled to one or more statutory exclusivity periods, during which time the FDA is prohibited from approving any products that are biosimilar to the branded product. The FDA cannot approve a biosimilar application for 12 years from the date of first licensure of the reference product. Additionally, a biosimilar product sponsor may not submit an application under the 351(k) pathway for four years from the date of first licensure of the reference product. A reference product may also be entitled to exclusivity under other statutory provisions. For example, a reference product designated for a rare disease or condition, or an orphan drug, may be entitled to seven years of exclusivity under section 360cc of the FFDCA, in which case no product that is biosimilar to the reference product may be approved until either the end of the 12-year period provided under §351(k) or the end of the seven year orphan drug exclusivity period, whichever occurs later. In certain circumstances, a regulatory exclusivity period can extend beyond the life of a patent and thus block §351(k) applications from being approved on or after the patent expiration date. In addition, the FDA may under certain circumstances extend the exclusivity period for the reference product by an additional six months if the FDA requests, and the manufacturer undertakes, studies on the effect of its product in children, a so-called pediatric extension. 
 The first biological product determined to be interchangeable with a branded product for any condition of use is also entitled to a period of exclusivity, during which time the FDA may not determine that another product is interchangeable with the reference product for any condition of use. This exclusivity period extends until the earlier of: (1) one year after the first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable product; (2) 18 months after resolution of a patent infringement suit instituted under 42 U.S.C. § 262(l)(6) against the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product, based on a final court decision regarding all of the patents in the litigation or dismissal of the litigation with or without prejudice; (3) 42 months after approval of the first interchangeable product, if a patent infringement suit instituted under 42 U.S.C. § 262(l)(6) against the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product is still ongoing; or (4) 18 months after approval of the first interchangeable product if the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product has not been sued under 42 U.S.C. § 262(l)(6). 
 Advertising and Promotion 
 Once a BLA is approved, a product will be subject to continuing post-approval regulatory requirements, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in significant penalties, including the issuance of warning letters directing a company to correct deviations from FDA standards, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre-cleared by the FDA and federal and state civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions. 
 Biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. After approval, most changes to the approved product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. A BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing BLA supplements as it does in reviewing BLAs. There are also continuing annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 
 Adverse Event Reporting and GMP Compliance 
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following FDA approval of a BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 testing, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage and distribution procedures must continue to conform to current cGMPs after approval. Biologics manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with 
 23


the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals, request product recalls or impose marketing restrictions through labeling changes or product removals if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. 
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency or with manufacturing processes or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;

• | product seizure or detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or

• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 Although we currently do not have any products on the market, if our product candidates are approved and we begin commercialization, we will be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations. In the past, the government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. Further, the recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the PPACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the criminal statute governing healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them. In addition, the PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act or federal civil money penalties statute. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. 
 Additionally, the civil False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. 
 In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The PPACA, among other things, imposes new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their 
 24


immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on pharmaceutical manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. 
 The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 
 International Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the U.S., a variety of foreign regulations govern clinical trials, commercial sales and distribution of product candidates. The approval process varies from country to country and the time to approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. In Europe, the approval of a biosimilar for marketing is based on an opinion issued by the EMA and a decision issued by the European Commission. However, substitution of a biosimilar for the originator is a decision that is made at the local (national) level on a country-by-country basis. Additionally, a number of European countries do not permit the automatic substitution of biosimilars for the originator product. Other regions, including Canada, Japan and Korea, also have their own legislation outlining a regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars. In some cases, other countries have either adopted European guidance (Singapore and Malaysia) or are following guidance issued by the World Health Organization (Cuba and Brazil). While there is overlap in the regulatory requirements across regions, there are also still some areas of non-overlap. 
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 In the U.S. and other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of medical products and services in addition to safety and efficacy and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our product candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
