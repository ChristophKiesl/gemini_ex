Item 1. Business.
 
The company was founded in Nevada as Freight Solution, Inc. in 2016.
 
On June 5, 2018, we underwent a change of control. In connection with the change of control, our board of directors and officers was reconstituted through the resignation of Shane Ludington as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer of the Registrant and the appointment of Mr. Eric Rice as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Mr. Jeffrey Doiron as President and Chief Operations Officer.
 
On June 6, 2018 we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Quanta Acquisition Corp. in the state of California, and executed an Agreement of Merger and Plan of Reorganization, with Bioanomaly, Inc., a California corporation, d/b/a Quanta and Quanta Acquisition Corp., a California corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiary. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Quanta Acquisition Corp. merged with and into Quanta in a statutory reverse triangular merger with Quanta surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary. Following the merger, we adopted our business plan.
 
On June 6, 2018, we cancelled 15,000,000 shares of common stock acquired through the change in control transaction. As consideration for the merger, we agreed to issue the shareholders of Quanta an aggregate of 21,908,810 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share. Freight Solution shareholders retained 6,500,000 shares of common stock, which represented 23% of our issued and outstanding stock following the merger.
 
Simultaneously with the merger, we accepted subscriptions for 6,500,000 shares of common stock in a private placement offering at a purchase price of $0.20 per share for an aggregate offering amount of $1,300,000. We also issued two non-affiliated investors warrants to purchase 3,000,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.30 per share expiring in four years.
 
Following the consummation of the merger, Quanta shareholders beneficially owned approximately 63% of our issued and outstanding common stock.
 
On July 11, 2018 the State of Nevada approved our name change from Freight Solution, Inc. to Quanta, Inc.
 
On April 14, 2020, we issued to Eric Rice, our former Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, 2,500,000 shares of a newly created class of preferred stock, Series A Preferred Stock.
 
On November 16, 2020, the Company entered into a Control Block Transfer Agreement with Eric Rice and Phil Sands, pursuant to which, Mr. Rice agreed to transfer 2,500,000 shares of the Company’s Series A Super Voting Preferred Stock to Mr. Sands, representing a transfer of majority voting control over the Company because the holder of such 2,500,000 shares of our Series A Super Voting Preferred Stock automatically carries a vote equal to 51% on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock. On November 16, 2020, the Company entered into a Share Cancellation Agreement with Eric Rice, holder of 18,030,032 shares of QNTA Common Stock, pursuant to which Mr. Rice agreed to cancel 17,030,032 shares (16,951,432 shares were cancelled December 29, 2020), and to retain ownership of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock.
 
On December 21, 2020, the Company entered into a Securities Exchange Agreement with Medolife Rx, Inc., a Wyoming corporation, (“Medolife”) pursuant to which, the Company agreed to acquire 51% of Medolife in exchange for 9,000 shares of newly created Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. On January 14, 2021, we completed our acquisition of 51% of Medolife and Medolife’s founder, Arthur Mikaelian, PhD, a member of our Board of Directors, officially replaced Phil Sands as our Chief Executive Officer. Phil Sands resigned as an officer and director of the Company on May 10, 2021.

Mr. Sands agreed to transfer the Control Block to Arthur Mikaelian in exchange for 3,000,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock, and for the payment of $22,500 in accrued salary, as well as the payment of health insurance benefits through January of 2022.
 
Medolife provides contract research services. The Company focuses on research, development, and production of pharmaceutical-grade products, as well as clinical evidence-based nutraceuticals utilizing patented polarization technology. Medolife Rx serves clients in the United States.
 
In 2007, Medolife began its venom-to-drug research and development concept. In 2008, Medolife identified the Rhopalurus princeps scorpion species, which are endemic to the Dominican Republic, as a possible candidate. The company entered into an agreement with the local Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources to investigate the anticancer properties of scorpion venom peptides. The Company’s research confirmed the anticancer properties of the peptide. In 2010, Medolife registered its product, Escozine, in the Dominican Republic due to the prime material and preliminary studies originating from Dominican Republic. Escozine was registered under Sanitary Registry Number PN2010-0244 as an anti-tumoral alternative medicine in the Dominican Republic, which allowed the company to perform clinical studies and observations in the country.

Quanta Muscle Rubs, which entered the CBD pain-relief rub market (“Muscle Rub”), is the first in a series of products to emerge from the company’s labs. At the heart of its well-documented effectiveness is the proprietary “polarization” process, which uses electromagnetic force to markedly enhance bioactivity at the molecular level. A polarized ingredient creates stronger bonds with the body’s receptors providing higher bioavailability. The company believes this natural solution has nearly limitless applications in the world of plant-based consumer products.
 
In early 2020, Medolife was preparing to apply to the FDA to initiate the approval process for Escozine as an orphan drug for pancreatic cancer. The Weinberg Group was hired as Medolife’s regulatory compliance consultants for the FDA application and guidelines.
 
As the COVID-19 pandemic spread during the Spring of 2020, Medolife studied the scorpion venom peptide as a potential COVID-19 drug treatment and began confirming its antiviral properties. The company applied to the FDA as a Pre-Investigational New Drug (PIND), which opened PIND #150335. For PIND Submission and Clinical Trial Strategy in the United States and the Dominican Republic, Medolife has contracted Affinity Bio Partners as a consulting firm on FDA regulatory matters.
 
In August of 2020, Medolife initiated clinical studies at the Cruz Jiminian Clinic (Clinica Cruz Jiminian) in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, which is a clinic with a license allowing them to treat COVID-19 patients. The study included 450 COVID-19 patients. The observation contained more female than male patients, with 252 female and 198 male participants. Out of 450 participants, there was an even spread among the age groups, with a higher number in the 41-to-50-year-old group.
 
EFFICACY STUDY.
 
Escozine was used as a 3-pillar treatment: a Therapeutic, a Palliative, and a Preventative.
 
Therapeutic
 

● | Escozine was used as a monotherapy 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | All therapeutic participants were tested COVID-19 positive prior to observation. 
● | 100% of patients were discharged with a negative COVID-19 test result within 7 to 10 days of treatment with Escozine. 

 
Conclusion: Within 4-5 days, all COVID-19 patients using Escozine tested negative for the virus, indicating Escozine eliminated the COVID-19 virus or accelerated recovery.
 
Palliative
 

● | COVID-19 positive patients report a dramatic decrease of symptoms within 2-4 days of Escozine treatments. The World Health Organization Quality of Life (“WHOQOL”) Bref quality of life questionnaire by the World Health Organization (WHO) was used since July 2020 to evaluating symptoms in patients, including: 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | Shortness of breath 
--+----------------------------
○ | Pain 
○ | Fatigue 
○ | Headache 
○ | Loss of taste 
○ | Fever 
○ | Loss of smell (anosmia) 

 
Conclusion: All participants reported significant improvement on all their COVID-19-related symptoms within 5 days, indicating that Escozine can be used to treat the symptoms of COVID-19.

Preventative
 

● | Transmission of virus to treating physicians and nurses of COVID-19 patients is inhibited upon administering Escozine. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Substantial reduction in infectability and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 

 
Conclusion: All hospital workers remained healthy during the clinical observation while taking Escozine, indicating that Escozine can be used as a preventative measure for COVID-19. The preventative capabilities require additional study.
 
SAFETY STUDY.
 
To verify the safety of using Escozine, patients were tested before and after treatment for:
 

● | Hematology 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Clinical chemistry (Kidney and Liver function tests, Enzymes, Glucose, Calcium and Phosphorus) 
● | Urine 
● | CD4/CD8 

 
Conclusion: No toxic response was observed in 100% of patients and no side-effects were reported, indicating that Escozine is safe to use for COVID-19 patients.
 
ADDITIONAL FINDINGS.
 
During the clinical study, Medolife observed that Escozine prevents Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) caused by COVID-19:
 

● | During the clinical study, no deaths occurred. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | 40% of the monitored COVID-19 patients who were administered Escozine, had serum creatinine that was higher than normal, indicating AKI before Escozine administration. 
● | After Escozine administration, most of the patient’s creatinine concentrations dropped or did not change. 
● | Overall, the frequency of patients that developed normal creatinine levels after Escozine administration was statistically significant (p<0.05). 


Medolife has received a new reply from the FDA on their latest submission of requested data. In the reply, the FDA: 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Stated that they acknowledge the Company’s clinical trial as an informal proof-of-concept study 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Laid out very specific guidelines for the next steps required by the regulatory body in order to garner approval for Escozine as a treatment for COVID-19, in which the FDA requested: 


○ | Pharmacokinetic (PK) study, which Medolife has initiated in the United Kingdom. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
○ | DNA toxicology study, for which Medolife is negotiating with a GLP certified laboratory in the United States. 
○ | Additional Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) data from Medolife’s contract manufacturer, CURE Pharmaceutical Corporation.
