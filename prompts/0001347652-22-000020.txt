ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
GENERAL
CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust, Inc. ("CorEnergy") was organized as a Maryland corporation and commenced operations on December 8, 2005. As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Report"), the terms "we", "us", "our" and the "Company" refer to CorEnergy and its subsidiaries.
COMPANY OVERVIEW
We are a publicly traded real estate investment trust ("REIT") focused on energy infrastructure. Our business strategy is to own and operate or lease critical energy midstream infrastructure connecting the upstream and downstream sectors within the industry. We currently generate revenue from the transportation, via pipeline, of crude oil and natural gas for our customers in California and Missouri. The pipelines are located in areas where it would be difficult to replicate rights of way or transport crude oil or natural gas via non-pipeline alternatives resulting in our assets providing utility-like criticality in the midstream supply chain for our customers. 
As primarily regulated assets, the near to medium term value of our regulated pipelines is supported by revenue derived from cost-of-service methodology. The cost-of-service methodology is used to establish appropriate transportation rates based on several factors including expected volumes, expenses, debt and return on equity. The regulated nature of the majority of our assets provides a degree of support for our profitability over the long-term, where our customers primarily own the products shipped on or stored in our facilities. We believe these characteristics provide CorEnergy with the attractive attributes of other globally listed infrastructure companies, including high barriers to entry and predictable revenue streams, while mitigating risks and volatility experienced by other companies engaged in the midstream energy sector.
Over the last twelve months, we have repositioned our asset portfolio from a focus on non-operated leased assets to one of owned and operated assets as described under "2021 Developments" below. As a result, all of our current assets are owned and operated which provides us with an opportunity to grow the business organically using our footprint in addition to making acquisitions. However, we still plan on pursuing the leasing or other non-operating ownership of assets, as part of our business model, when we believe appropriate opportunities arise. We intend to distribute substantially all of our cash available for distribution, less prudent reserves, on a quarterly basis. We regularly assess our ability to pay and to grow our dividend to Common Stockholders. 
Our Operations 
Our asset portfolio has significantly changed over the past two years. The current composition of our asset portfolio is described below.
Crimson Midstream Holdings: An approximately 2,000-mile crude oil transportation pipeline system, including approximately 1,100 active miles, and associated storage facilities located in southern California and the San Joaquin Valley. The Crimson assets include four pipeline systems that provide a critical link between California crude oil production and California refineries. The vast majority of Crimson's customers are the refineries. The operations and maintenance of these assets are in strict accordance with applicable safety and regulatory requirements promulgated by the U.S. Department of Transportation's ("DOT") Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ("PHMSA") and California State Fire Marshall. The California Public Utility Commission ("CPUC") regulates the rates and administration of the transportation tariffs which comprise the majority of our revenue generating activities. The Company acquired a 49.50 percent interest in the Crimson assets on February 4, 2021 (effective as of February 1, 2021) and includes the following pipeline systems:

Asset | Location | Asset Description 
Sol Cal Pipeline | Southern California | ~760 miles of pipe; 8 tanks and 6 pump stations. Transports crude oil from Los Angeles and Ventura basins to Los Angeles refineries. 
KLM Pipeline | San Joaquin Valley to Northern California | ~620 miles of pipe; 5 tanks and 7 pump stations. Transports crude oil from San Joaquin Valley to Bay Area refineries. 
San Pablo Bay Pipeline | San Joaquin Valley to Northern California | ~540 miles of heated pipe from San Joaquin Valley to Northern California; ~2.3 Mbbls tank capacity. Transports crude from San Joaquin Valley to Bay Area refineries.
Proprietary Pipeline | South of Bakersfield | ~100 miles of pipe. Connects Crimson system to rail volumes and supports other in-basin crude movements. 

MoGas Pipeline System: An approximate 263-mile interstate natural gas pipeline in and around St. Louis and extending into central Missouri. The pipeline network provides a critical link between natural gas producing regions with local utilities. The system receives natural gas at four separate receipt points from third party interstate gas pipelines and delivers that gas through 

Glossary of Defined Terms

24 different delivery points to investor-owned natural gas distribution companies, municipalities and end users. MoGas has eight firm transportation customers. MoGas operates and maintains these assets in strict accordance with applicable safety and regulatory requirements promulgated by PHMSA. The vast majority of our revenue is related to our Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC")-approved firm transportation agreements with various customers which entitle the customers to specified amounts of guaranteed capacity on the pipeline during the term of the agreements. We also earn additional revenue from our customers based on actual volumes of natural gas transported under either the firm transportation agreements, or under interruptible transportation agreements, but these revenues comprise a minimal percentage of our total revenue. MoGas is a wholly owned TRS subsidiary of CorEnergy.
Omega Pipeline: An approximate 75-mile natural gas distribution system located primarily on the U.S. Army's Fort Leonard Wood military post in south-central Missouri. Omega Pipeline Company, LLC ("Omega") operates and maintains these assets in strict accordance with applicable safety and regulatory requirements promulgated by the Missouri Public Service Commission ("MoPUC"). The vast majority of Omega’s revenue is derived from a non-regulated Natural Gas Distribution Agreement between Omega and the U.S. Department of Defense ("DOD"), to provide the natural gas supply, distribution assets, operations and maintenance of the assets at Fort Leonard Wood. Omega has been under contract with the DOD since 1991 at Fort Leonard Wood, and we are currently in year five of a ten-year renewable agreement. We also earn additional revenue from Omega Gas Marketing, LLC providing gas supply services to a small number of industrial and commercial customers in central Missouri near Fort Leonard Wood, but these revenues comprise a minimal percentage of our total revenue. Omega is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company through its interests in Mowood, which is a qualified REIT subsidiary.
Leased Energy Infrastructure Assets
On February 4, 2021, the Grand Isle Gathering System was used as partial consideration for the acquisition of our 49.50 percent interest in Crimson described in Part I, Item 1, Business, of this Report resulting in its disposition and the termination of the Grand Isle Lease Agreement. In connection with the disposition, the Company entered into a Settlement and Mutual Release Agreement with the EGC Tenant, EGC, and CEXXI, LLC. Refer to Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of this Report for additional information on the resolution of the legal matters, and Part IV, Item 15, Note 5 ("Leased Properties And Leases"), for additional information on the disposition of the GIGS asset and termination of the Grand Isle Lease Agreement. On June 30, 2020, we sold back to UPL the Pinedale LGS, which previously had been triple-net leased on a long-term basis to a subsidiary of UPL.
Principal Location
Our principal executive office is located at 1100 Walnut Street, Suite 3350, Kansas City, MO 64106.
Market Overview 
Crude oil production in California dates back more than 150 years and the state has some of the highest recoverable reserves remaining in the ground. Given the significant hydrocarbon resources in California, and its access to the Pacific Ocean, California is not connected, via pipeline, to other crude oil producing regions in North America. The refining industry in California is primarily supplied first by native California crude oil production with the balance being supplied via waterborne imports. The majority of refineries in California are specifically designed to service California from both a crude oil supply and refined products standpoint. Many refineries are specifically designed to process the low-gravity crude oil that is prevalent in California. Furthermore, the refineries are also uniquely designed to meet the stringent California gasoline standards set by the California Air Resources Board ("CARB"). The high complexity of CARB requirements for California refiners results in a preference for California produced crude oil as a feedstock. Furthermore, the stringent refined product formulations required by CARB provide high barriers to entry for satisfying California's refined product demand from refineries outside of California.
The utilization of MoGas and Omega assets is driven by the consumption of natural gas from residential, commercial and industrial users in the region where MoGas' and Omega's assets are located. MoGas is well supplied by other interstate pipelines, originating in the Rocky Mountains, Mid-Continent, Appalachia, and Gulf Coast production basins.
Business Strategy
•Safe Operations - We strive for the highest levels of safety across our operational platform, which includes establishing a safety first environment for our employees and contractors, investing in the latest safety related technology, maintaining asset integrity and operational reliability through frequent inspections and communicating regularly with governmental regulators.

Glossary of Defined Terms

•Provide reliable service - We serve a critical part of the energy distribution value chain and seek to ensure reliable and consistent service to our customers. We accomplish this by performing preventative maintenance on our assets and performing frequent pipeline integrity work. 
•Growth - CorEnergy has a 3-part growth strategy: 1) expansion within our existing pipeline footprint, 2) Corporate level acquisitions that add scale and diversification, and 3) participate in energy transition through the storage and transportation of renewable energy sources and carbon sequestration projects. We consider, among other things, the following factors to be key when evaluating growth opportunities:
▪Cash Flow Stability – We primarily seek growth opportunities which provide stable and predictable cash flow through either long-term contracts or a regulated cost-of-service. As a second layer of stability, we look for assets which have natural barriers to entry with low current competition. We focus on assets which are critical to our customers' realization of economic returns from their operations. We believe that this type of asset will provide a relatively low risk of nonuse, and therefore loss, in the case of a potential bankruptcy or abandonment scenario.
▪Diversification – We attempt to diversify our portfolio to avoid dependence on any one particular customer, counterparty, commodity, and market location within the U.S. By diversifying, we seek to reduce the adverse effect of a single under-performing investment or a downturn in any particular asset, commodity, or market region.
▪Financing Strategy - We believe a major factor in our continued success is our ability to maintain financial flexibility, a competitive cost of capital and access to the capital markets. Our long-term target is a total debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of less than 4.0x. However, we may exceed that target during an acquisition if there is a viable path to returning to the long-term target. In addition to debt, we may use preferred or common equity to satisfy remaining capital needs to help limit the amount of financial risk of the Company.
Competitive Advantages
•Strategic Assets - We believe our assets are strategically unique in that they have largely high barriers to entry, require unique operational and regulatory expertise that we hold and have strategic rights-of-way that may have alternative use value in association with the energy transition. 
•Tax Status - Through a series of Private Letter Rulings, we hold a unique status as an energy infrastructure focused REIT. We are therefore generally not subject to U.S. federal corporate income taxes on the income and gains that we distribute to our stockholders. 
•Customer Quality - Our customers associated with our Crimson assets are primarily large investment grade refineries and our customers associated with our MoGas and Omega assets are investment grade utilities, municipalities and government organizations that largely insulate us from significant counterparty credit risk. For a discussion of customers, see Part IV, Item 15, Note 10 ("Concentrations") to our consolidated financial statements.
•Management Team - Members of our leadership team have significant experience in all phases of operations of regulated pipeline assets, financing including public capital markets, acquisitions of energy midstream operations and regulatory compliance. We believe that is a benefit to our strategy.
Seasonality 
MoGas and Omega generally have stable revenues throughout the year and will complete necessary pipeline maintenance during the "non-heating" season, or quarters two and three. Therefore, operating results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year.
We expect Crimson Pipeline will have stable revenues throughout the year. Maintenance activities can be performed at any time during the year, however we can have certain quarters where maintenance expenditures are materially higher then other quarters in the year. Our San Pablo Bay pipeline has a seasonal minimum volume required to be operated as a batched system delivering heavy crude oil to its customers. The minimum volume is required as heavy crude oil must be heated to be transported via the pipeline. The lowest allowed minimum volume typically occurs in the months from July to September. The highest allowed 

Glossary of Defined Terms

minimum volume typically occurs from December to March. The actual effective periods are dependent on the ground temperature. If minimum volumes are not reached, the pipeline will operate as a blended crude system where the heavy crude oil is mixed with lighter crude oil to ensure the pipeline can still operate. The historical average quarterly crude oil volumes for Crimson are provided in the table below. 

 | Crimson Average Crude Oil Volume for Quarter Ended (bpd):
 | | December 31, 2020 | March 31, 2021 | June 30, 2021 | September 30, 2021 | | December 31, 2021
Crude oil volume | | 201,732 | 197,764 | 188,634 | | 191,621 | | 184,467

Competition 
We compete with other midstream energy companies as well as public and private funds, to make the types of investments that we plan to make in the U.S. energy infrastructure sector. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than us. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to a greater variety of funding sources than are available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, allowing them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. These competitive conditions may adversely affect our ability to make investments in the energy infrastructure sector and could adversely affect our distributions to stockholders.
Pipelines generally offer the lowest cost and safest mode of transportation. Despite this, pipelines can face competition from other forms of transportation, such as truck, rail and ship. Although these alternative forms of transportation are typically higher cost, they can provide access to alternative markets which could be attractive to our customers for various reasons.
The primary competition for our California assets is existing pipelines and trucking. In mature and stable crude oil producing regions like California, the threat of a newly constructed pipelines is low. Furthermore, a significant percentage of our assets are located in an urban environment which also significantly decreases the competition from new construction. 
REIT Status
We operate as a REIT and therefore are generally not subject to U.S. federal corporate income taxes on the income and gains that we distribute to our stockholders, including the income derived through leasing fees and financing revenue from our REIT qualifying investments in energy infrastructure assets. Our REIT status is supported in part through a series of IRS Private Letter Rulings (PLR) that provide us assurance that fees we may receive for usage of the storage and pipeline assets we may own will qualify as rents from real property for purposes of our qualification as a REIT. 
However, even as a REIT, we remain obligated to pay income taxes on earnings from our TRSs. The use of TRSs enables us to own certain assets and engage in certain businesses while maintaining compliance with the REIT qualification requirements under the Code. We may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be treated as qualified REIT subsidiaries, and may reorganize and transfer certain assets or operations from our TRSs to other subsidiaries, including qualified REIT subsidiaries.
Regulatory and Environmental Matters
Our energy infrastructure assets and operations, as well as those of our tenants, are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of public health and safety, zoning and land use, and pricing and other matters related to certain of our business operations. For a discussion of the current effects and potential future impacts of such regulations on our business and properties, see the discussion presented in Item 1A of this Report under the subheading "Risks Related to Our Investments in Energy Infrastructure." In particular, for a discussion of the current and potential future effects of compliance with federal, state and local environmental regulations, see the discussion titled "Costs of complying with governmental laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental matters, may adversely affect our income and the cash available for distribution to our stockholders" within such section.
FERC and State PUC Common Carrier Regulations
The vast majority of our operated pipeline systems are subject to economic and operational regulation by various federal, state and/or local agencies. Our rates are generally set based on a regulated cost-of-service model.
FERC regulates interstate transportation on our common carrier pipeline systems under the Interstate Commerce Act ("ICA"), the Natural Gas Act, the Environmental Protection Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. FERC 

Glossary of Defined Terms

regulations require that rates and terms and conditions of service be just and reasonable and must not be unduly discriminatory or confer any undue preference upon any shipper. FERC's regulations also require interstate common carrier pipelines to file with FERC and publicly post tariffs stating their interstate transportation rates and terms and conditions of service.
Under the ICA, FERC or any interested private entity or person may challenge existing or proposed new or changed rates, services or terms and conditions of service. FERC is authorized to investigate such charges and may suspend the effectiveness of a new rate for a period of time or could limit a common carrier pipeline's ability to change rates until completion of an investigation. During an investigation, FERC could find that the new or changed rate is unlawful.
Intrastate transportation services, provided by our California pipeline system, are subject to regulation by the CPUC. The CPUC requires intrastate pipelines to file their rates with the agencies and permit shippers to challenge existing rates and proposed rate increases. The CPUC could limit our ability to increase our rates or could order us to reduce our rates and require the payment of refunds to shippers. 
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulation 
Our operations involve the transportation of crude oil and natural gas which are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect the environment. Compliance with these laws and regulations increases our overall cost of doing business. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, and the addition of new operational constraints. Environmental and safety laws and regulations are subject to changes that may result in more stringent requirements which could negatively impact our future earnings to the extent they cannot be recovered through our cost-of-service framework. A discharge of hazardous liquids into the environment could, to the extent such event is not insured, subject us to substantial expense. The following summarizes some of the key environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which our operations are subject.
Pipeline and Tank Safety and Integrity Management
The majority of our assets are subject to regulation by the DOT's PHMSA pursuant to the Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 ("HLPSA"). The HLPSA imposes safety requirements on the design, construction, operation and maintenance of pipeline and storage facilities. Federal regulations implementing the HLPSA require pipeline operators to adopt measures designed to reduce the environmental impact of their operations, including the maintenance of comprehensive spill response plans and the performance of spill response training for pipeline personnel. These regulations also require pipeline operators to develop and maintain a written qualification program for individuals performing covered tasks on pipeline facilities. 
The HLPSA was amended by the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 and the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006. These amendments have resulted in the adoption of rules by the DOT that requires transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs to ensure pipeline safety in "high consequence areas" such as high population areas, areas unusually sensitive to environmental damage, and navigable waterways.
In October 2015, the Governor of California signed the Oil Spill Response: Environmentally and Ecologically Sensitive Areas Bill ("AB-864") which requires new and existing pipelines located near environmentally and ecologically sensitive areas connected to or located in the coastal zone to use best available technologies to reduce the amount of oil released in an oil spill to protect state waters and wildlife. The California Office of the State Fire Marshal has developed the regulations required by AB-864 and full compliance is required by early 2023. The Company submitted recommendations for pipeline segment improvements in December 2021, which were subsequently accepted by the California Office of the State Fire Marshal in 2022. The Company has begun the process of making the recommended modifications. The Company has submitted a filing with the CPUC to implement a surcharge on existing tariffs to recover the costs associated with the regulation and formal approval by the CPUC is expected in the summer of 2022. 
The DOT has generally adopted American Petroleum Institute Standard ("API") 653 as the standard for the maintenance of steel above ground petroleum storage tanks subject to DOT jurisdiction. API 653 requires regularly scheduled inspection and repair of tanks remaining in service.
Occupational Safety and Health
We are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended ("OSHA") and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that certain information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.

2021 Developments 
Fiscal year 2021 was one of transition for CorEnergy, as we moved from owning and leasing critical energy midstream infrastructure to owning and operating critical energy midstream infrastructure. The key events during fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 are summarized below:
•On February 4, 2021, (effective February 1, 2021), we completed the acquisition of a 49.50 percent interest in Crimson Midstream Holdings (which includes a 49.50 percent voting interest and the right to 100.0 percent of the economic benefit of Crimson's business, after satisfying the distribution rights of the remaining equity holders) for total consideration with a fair value of $343.8 million after giving effect to the initial working capital adjustments and with the right to acquire the remaining 50.50 percent, subject to CPUC approval. Crimson is a CPUC regulated crude oil pipeline owner and operator, and its assets include four critical infrastructure pipeline systems spanning approximately 2,000 miles (including approximately 1,100 active miles) across northern, central and southern California, connecting California crude production to in-state refineries. Refer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 3 ("Acquisitions") for further details. 
The Grand Isle Gathering System ("GIGS") asset was used as partial consideration for the acquisition of Crimson, with a fair value of $48.9 million to the sellers. GIGS is an approximately 137-mile subsea crude oil pipeline system located in the Gulf of Mexico south of Grand Isle, Louisiana and a 16-acre onshore terminal facility located in Grand Isle, Louisiana. CorEnergy had a triple-net lease for these assets on a long-term basis to a subsidiary of Energy Gulf Coast, Inc. ("EGC"), pursuant to the Grand Isle Lease Agreement. Refer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 3 ("Acquisitions") for further details. 
•On July 6, 2021, we consummated the internalization of our former management company Corridor InfraTrust Management, Inc. ("Corridor" or "Manager"), (the “Internalization”) for a purchase price of approximately $14.6 million, paid in equity, pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, dated as of February 4, 2021 (the "Contribution Agreement”). Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement and following approval by our stockholders, we acquired Corridor, which owned the assets used in its performance of the management functions previously provided to us. Upon closing of the Internalization, we became an internally managed real estate investment trust. As an internally managed company, we no longer pay the former Manager any fees or expense reimbursements arising from the Management Agreement but rather incur the former Manager's direct employee compensation and office related expenses. Refer to Part IV, Item 15, for further details.
