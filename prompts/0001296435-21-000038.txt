Item 1.    Business
Overview
Neenah is a specialty materials company organized into two primary businesses: a performance-based technical products business and a premium fine paper and packaging business. 
Our technical products business is a leading international producer of transportation, water and other filter media and durable, saturated and coated substrates for a variety of end markets. We focus on categories where we believe we are, or can be, a market leader. These categories include filtration media for transportation, water and other end use applications, backings for specialty tapes and abrasives, performance labels, digital transfer papers, and other custom engineered materials. Our products are typically used in high performance applications where our customers require specific standards and qualifications. Our dedicated technical products manufacturing facilities are located in Weidach and Bruckmühl, Germany, Eerbeek, Netherlands, Bolton, England, Munising, Michigan, Appleton, Wisconsin, and Pittsfield, Massachusetts.
Our fine paper and packaging business is a leading supplier of premium printing, packaging, and other high-end specialty papers predominantly in North America. Our products include some of the most recognized and preferred brands in North America, where we enjoy leading market positions in many of our product categories. Often these papers are characterized by distinctive finishing, colors, textures and coating. We sell our products primarily to authorized paper distributors, as well as through converters, major national retailers and specialty businesses. Our dedicated fine paper and packaging manufacturing facilities are located in Whiting and Neenah, Wisconsin, and Great Barrington, Massachusetts. 
In addition, certain products of both businesses are manufactured in shared facilities located in Brownville and Lowville, New York, and Quakertown, Pennsylvania. For a description of our facilities, see Item 2, "Properties."
History of the Businesses
Neenah was incorporated in April 2004 in contemplation of the spin-off by Kimberly-Clark Corporation ("Kimberly-Clark") of its technical products and fine paper businesses in the United States and its Canadian pulp business (collectively, the "Pulp and Paper Business"). We had no material assets or activities until Kimberly-Clark's transfer to us of the Pulp and Paper business on November 30, 2004. On that date, Kimberly-Clark completed the distribution of all of the shares of our common stock to the stockholders of Kimberly-Clark.
Former Pulp Operations.  Our former pulp operations consisted of mills located in Terrace Bay, Ontario and Pictou, Nova Scotia and approximately 975,000 acres of related woodlands. We disposed of these mills and woodlands in a series of transactions from 2006 through 2010. 
Technical Products.  The Munising, Michigan mill was purchased by Kimberly-Clark in 1952. Subsequent to the purchase, the mill was converted to produce durable, saturated and coated papers for sale and use in a variety of industrial applications for our technical products business. 
In October 2006, we purchased the outstanding interests of FiberMark Services GmbH & Co. KG and the outstanding interests of FiberMark Beteiligungs GmbH (collectively "Neenah Germany"). At acquisition, the Neenah Germany assets consisted of three mills located in Weidach, Bruckmühl and Lahnstein, Germany. These mills produce a wide range of products, including transportation filter media, nonwoven wall coverings, masking and other tapes, abrasive backings, and specialized printing and coating substrates. In October 2015, we sold the Lahnstein mill to the Kajo Neukirchen Group. The Lahnstein mill had been manufacturing nonwoven wallcoverings and various other specialty papers.
In July 2014, we purchased all of the outstanding equity of Crane Technical Materials, Inc. from Crane & Co., Inc. The acquired business provides performance-oriented wet laid nonwoven media for water filtration end markets as well as environmental, energy and industrial uses. The business has two manufacturing facilities in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.
In November 2017, we purchased all of the outstanding equity of Neenah Coldenhove B.V. ("Neenah Coldenhove"). The acquired business is a specialty materials manufacturer with a leading position in digital transfer media and other technical products. The business has one manufacturing facility in Eerbeek, Netherlands.
Fine Paper and Packaging.  The fine paper and packaging business was incorporated in 1885 as Neenah Paper Company, which initially operated a single paper mill in Neenah, Wisconsin. Kimberly-Clark acquired the mill in 1956. In 1981, Kimberly-Clark purchased an additional mill located in Whiting, Wisconsin and in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the capacity of the fine paper and packaging business was expanded by building two new paper machines at the Whiting mill and completing a major expansion of the Neenah facility with the installation of a new paper machine, finishing center, customer service center and an expanded distribution center. 
In the first of the series of consolidating acquisitions, in March 2007, we acquired the assets and brands of Neenah Paper FR, LLC ("Fox River") (including our mill located in Appleton, Wisconsin). In January 2012, we purchased certain premium fine paper brands and other assets from Wausau Paper Mills, LLC, a subsidiary of Wausau Paper Corp. ("Wausau") and in January 2013, we purchased certain premium business paper brands from the Southworth Company ("Southworth"). 
In August 2017, we purchased a laminating asset in Great Barrington, Massachusetts to support continued growth in our premium packaging business.
Shared Facilities.  In August 2015, we purchased all of the outstanding equity of ASP FiberMark, LLC ("FiberMark"). We added specialty coating and finishing capabilities with this acquisition, particularly in luxury packaging and technical products. The results of operations and assets related to FiberMark are reflected in each of our business segments. These mills are located in Brownville and Lowville, New York, Quakertown, Pennsylvania and Bolton, England. On December 31, 2018, the Company completed the sale of certain equipment, inventory, real property and other specified assets relating to the Company’s premium fine paper and office products manufacturing facility located in Brattleboro, Vermont. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, "Asset Restructuring and Impairment Costs."
One of the two fine paper machines included in the Fox River acquisition and located in Appleton, Wisconsin (noted above) was converted to produce filtration products. This business, Neenah Filtration Appleton, began operations in 2017 and produces transportation and other filtration media.

Products
Technical Products.  Our technical products business is a leading international producer of fiber-formed, durable, coated and/or saturated specialized media that delivers high performance benefits to customers, such as filtration media for transportation, water and other filtration markets, and saturated and coated performance materials used for specialty tapes, abrasives, performance labels, digital transfer papers, and a variety of other end markets. Typically, our technical products are sold to other manufacturers as key components for their finished products. Many of our key market segments served, including filtration and specialty backings for tape and abrasives, are global in scope. JET-PRO®SofStretchTM, KIMDURA®, PREVAILTM, NEENAH®, and GESSNER® are some of the brands of our technical products business. 
The following is a description of certain key products and markets:
Filtration media for transportation, including induction air, fuel, oil, cabin air and other applications. Transportation filtration media are sold to filter manufacturers who in turn supply automotive and other companies with filters used as original equipment on new cars and trucks as well as to the aftermarket, which is a recurring sale and represents the large majority of our sales. In 2020, we introduced high performance face mask media in Europe.
Filtration media for water and other industrial end markets. Primary applications include reverse osmosis, catalytic conversion, nanofiltration, ultrafiltration, pervaporation and vapor permeation, as well as other applications for specialty markets.
Specialty backings. Products in this market segment include (a) saturated and unsaturated crepe and flat paper tapes sold to manufacturers to produce finished pressure sensitive products for sale in automotive, transportation, manufacturing, building construction, and industrial general purpose applications, including sales in the consumer do-it-yourself retail channel and (b) coated lightweight abrasive paper used in the automotive, construction, metal and woodworking industries for both dry and wet sanding applications.
Digital transfer media. Products in this market are used to transfer digital images onto clothing, sportswear, and other materials.

Digital transfer papers are also used to digitally print images from paper to clothing, hats, coffee mugs, and other surfaces.
Label and tag products. Products in this market are made from both saturated base label stock and synthetic base label stock, with coatings applied to allow for high quality digital printing. Label and tag stock is sold to pressure sensitive coaters, who in turn sell the coated label and tag stock to the label printing community.
Other latex saturated and coated papers for use by a wide variety of manufacturers. Premask paper is used as a protective over wrap for products during the manufacturing process and for applying signs, labeling and other finished products. Medical packaging paper is typically a polymer impregnated base sheet providing a breathable sterilization barrier that provides unique properties. 
Publishing and security papers. Products in this market are used to produce book covers, stationery, and passports. Other specialty products include clean room papers, release papers and furniture backers.
Fine Paper and Packaging.  Our fine paper and packaging business manufactures and sells world-class branded premium writing, text, cover and specialty papers and envelopes used in high-end commercial printing services, corporate identity packages and advertising collateral. In addition, we produce premium packaging, high end beverage labels and other forms of packaging, as well as wide format applications used for display graphics and indoor/outdoor signage. Often these papers are characterized by finishing, colors, textures and distinctive coating.
The following is a description of certain key products and markets:
Commercial printing papers, including premium writing, text and cover papers and envelopes. Uses include advertising collateral, stationery, corporate identity packages and brochures, pocket folders, annual reports, advertising inserts, direct mail, business cards, scrapbooks, and a variety of other uses where colors, texture, coating, unique finishes or heavier weight papers are desired. Our market leading brands in this category include CLASSIC®, CLASSIC CREST®, ENVIRONMENT®, ROYAL SUNDANCE®, SOUTHWORTH®, and TOUCHE® trademarks. Our fine paper and packaging business has an exclusive agreement to market and distribute Gruppo Cordenons SpA's SO...SILK®, PLIKE® and STARDREAM® branded fine papers in the U.S. and Canada.

Other. The fine paper and packaging business also produces and sells other specialty papers such as translucent papers, art papers, papers for optical scanning and other specialized applications.
There were no significant government contracts to disclose in either segment.
Markets and Customers
Technical Products.  The technical products business sells its products globally to other manufacturers who convert our product for sale into product categories generally used as base materials in the following applications: filtration, component backing materials for manufactured products such as tape and abrasives, and other specialized product uses such as graphics and identification. Customers typically convert and transform base papers and film into finished rolls and sheets by adding adhesives, coatings, and finishes. These transformed products are then sold to end-users.
Our products are generally used in markets that are directly affected by economic business cycles. Certain market segments such as digital transfer papers used in small/home office and consumer applications are relatively stable. Most products are performance-based and require extended qualification by customers; however, certain categories may also be subject to price competition and the substitution of lower cost substrates for some less demanding applications.
The technical products business relies on a team of direct sales representatives and customer service representatives to market and sell a large majority of its sales volume directly to customers and converters.
The technical products business has more than 1,000 customers worldwide. The distribution of sales in 2020 was approximately 44 percent in North America, 39 percent in Europe, and 17 percent in Asia, Latin America, and Africa.
Fine Paper and Packaging.  We believe our fine paper and packaging business is a leading supplier of premium printing, packaging, and other high-end specialty papers predominantly in North America. These products are used in high-end commercial printing services, corporate identity packages, and advertising collateral. Our premium packaging business includes products such as food and beverage labels and high-end packaging materials such as folding cartons and box wrap used for luxury retail goods. In addition, we produce wide format applications used for display graphics and indoor/outdoor signage. Bright papers are generally used by consumers for flyers, direct mail and packaging.
The fine paper and packaging business has over 450 customers worldwide. The fine paper and packaging business sells its products in a variety of channels including authorized paper distributors, converters, major national retailers, specialty business converters, and direct to end-users. Sales to distributors account for approximately 50 percent of net sales in the fine paper and packaging business. During 2020, approximately 7 percent of the net sales of our fine paper and packaging business were exported to markets outside North America.
Concentration.  For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, sales to the technical products business' largest customer represented approximately 9 percent and 8 percent of consolidated net sales, respectively, and approximately 15 percent and 14 percent of net sales for the technical products segment, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2018, there were no customers to which sales constituted over 10 percent of segment net sales for technical products. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, sales to the largest customer of fine paper and packaging business represented approximately 6 percent and 8 percent of consolidated net sales, respectively, and approximately 18 percent of net sales of the fine paper and packaging business for each of such years. For the year ended December 31, 2018, sales to the two largest customers of fine paper and packaging business represented approximately 7 percent and 5 percent, respectively, of consolidated net sales and approximately 16 percent and 12 percent, respectively, of net sales of the fine paper and packaging business. We practice limited sales distribution to improve our ability to control the marketing of our products. Although a complete loss of these customers would cause a temporary decline in the respective business' sales volume, we believe the decline could be partially offset by expanding sales to existing customers, and further offset over a several month period with the addition of new customers.
Competition
Technical Products.  Our technical products business competes in global markets with a number of large multinational competitors, including Ahlstrom-Munksjö, ArjoWiggins SAS and Hollingsworth & Vose Company. It also competes in some, but not all, of these segments with smaller regional manufacturers, such as Monadnock Paper Mills, Inc. and Potsdam Specialty Paper, Inc. We believe the bases of competition in most of these categories are the ability to design and develop customized product features to meet customer performance specifications while maintaining quality, customer service and a competitive price. We believe our research and development program gives us an advantage in customizing base papers and developing advanced filter media to meet customer needs.
Fine Paper and Packaging.  Our fine paper and packaging business is a leading supplier of premium printing and other high-end specialty papers in North America. Our fine paper and packaging business also competes in the premium segment of the uncoated free sheet market. The fine paper and packaging business competes directly in North America with Mohawk Fine Paper Inc. We believe the primary bases of competition for premium fine papers are product quality, customer service, product availability, promotional support, color and texture variety, and brand recognition. Price also can be a factor particularly for lower quality printing needs that may compete with opaque and offset papers. We have and will continue to invest in advertising and other programs aimed at graphic designers, printers and corporate end-users in order to maintain a high level of brand awareness and to communicate the advantages of using our products. 
Our premium packaging business is focused on high-end packaging needs in end market verticals like beauty products, spirits and retail. Like our premium fine paper business, the primary bases of competition are similarly product quality, customer service, product availability, color and texture variety, and brand recognition. Premium packaging is primarily a North American business, but we also sell to customers in Asia and other markets outside the U.S. We believe the premium packaging market to be highly fragmented, with multiple competitors, many of which produce premium packaging products as a small subset of larger packaging operations.

See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, "Business Segment and Geographic Information", for information with respect to net sales, operating income and long-lived assets by business segment and location.
Seasonality
Technical Products.  In general, sales and operating income for the technical products business have historically been relatively stronger in the first half of the year with reductions in the third quarter due to reduced customer converting schedules and in the fourth quarter due to a reduction in year-end inventory levels by our customers. The order flow for the technical products business is subject to seasonal peaks for several of its products, such as the larger volume grades of specialty tape, abrasives, premask, and label stock used primarily in the downstream finished goods manufacturing process. To assure timely shipments during these seasonal peaks, the technical products business provides certain customers with finished goods inventory on consignment. The technical products business periodically experiences periods where order entry levels surge, and order backlogs can increase substantially. Raw materials are purchased and manufacturing schedules are planned based on customer forecasts, current market conditions and individual orders for custom products. 
Fine Paper and Packaging.  The fine paper and packaging business has historically not experienced seasonality. Orders for stock products are typically shipped within two days, while custom orders are shipped within two to three weeks of receipt. Raw material purchases and manufacturing schedules are planned based on a combination of historical trends, customer forecasts and current market conditions. 
The operating results for both of our businesses are influenced by the timing of our annual maintenance downs, which are generally scheduled in the third quarter.
Resources
Raw Materials
Technical Products.  Softwood pulp, specialty pulps and fibers, and latex are the primary raw materials consumed by our technical products business that are purchased from various external suppliers. We believe that all of the raw materials for our technical products operations, except for certain specialty latex grades and specialty pulps, are readily available from several sources and that the loss of a single supplier would not cause a shutdown of our manufacturing operations.
Our technical products business acquires all of its specialized pulp requirements from two global suppliers and certain critical specialty latex grades from four suppliers. In general, these supply arrangements are covered by formal contracts, and represent multi-year business relationships that have historically been sufficient to meet our needs. We expect these relationships to continue to operate in a satisfactory manner in the future. In the event of an interruption of production at any one supplier, we believe that each of these suppliers individually would be able to satisfy our short-term requirements for specialized pulp or specialty latex. In the event of a long-term disruption in our supply of specialized pulp or specialty latex, we believe we would be able to substitute other pulp grades or other latex grades that would allow us to meet required product performance characteristics and incur only a limited disruption in our production. As a result, we do not believe that the substitution of such alternative pulp or latex grades would have a material effect on our operations.
Fine Paper and Packaging.  Hardwood pulp is the primary raw material used to produce products of the fine paper and packaging business. Other significant raw material inputs in the production of fine paper and packaging products include softwood pulp, recycled fiber, cotton fiber, dyes and fillers. The fine paper and packaging business purchases all of its raw materials externally. We believe that all of the raw materials for our fine paper and packaging operations are readily available from several sources and that the loss of a single supplier would not cause a shutdown of our manufacturing operations.
Working Capital
Technical Products.  The technical products business maintains approximately 25 to 30 days of raw materials and supplies inventories to support its manufacturing operations and approximately 30 to 35 days of finished goods inventory to support customer orders for its products. Sales terms in the technical products business vary depending on the type of product sold and customer category. Extended credit terms of up to 120 days are offered to customers located in certain international markets. In general, sales are collected in approximately 45 to 55 days and supplier invoices are paid within 20 to 25 days.
Fine Paper and Packaging.  The fine paper and packaging business maintains approximately 15 to 20 days of raw material inventories to support its paper making operations and about 60 to 65 days of finished goods inventory to fill customer orders. Fine paper and packaging sales terms range between 20 and 30 days with discounts of up to 2 percent for customer 
payments, with discounts of 1 percent and 20-day terms used most often. Extended credit terms are offered to customers located in certain international markets. Supplier invoices are typically paid within 60 days.
Energy and Water
The equipment used to manufacture the products of our technical products and fine paper and packaging businesses uses significant amounts of energy, primarily electricity, natural gas, oil and coal. We have the ability to generate substantially all of our electrical energy at the Munising mill and approximately 25 percent of the electrical energy at our mills in Appleton, Wisconsin and Bruckmühl, Germany. We also purchase electrical energy from external sources, including electricity generated from renewable sources.
Availability of energy is not expected to be a problem in the foreseeable future, but the purchase price of such energy can and likely will fluctuate significantly based on changes in demand and other factors.
An adequate supply of water is needed to manufacture our products. We believe that there is an adequate supply of water for this purpose at each of our manufacturing locations.
Research and Development
Our technical products business maintains research and development laboratories in Feldkirchen-Westerham, Germany, Eerbeek, Netherlands, Munising, Michigan, and Pittsfield, Massachusetts to support its strategy of developing new products and technologies, and to support growth in its existing product lines and other strategically important markets. We also have a research and development laboratory in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts that supports both our technical products and fine paper and packaging businesses. We have continually invested in product research and development with spending of $7.6 million in 2020, $8.7 million in 2019, and $9.2 million in 2018.
Intellectual Property
We own more than 100 granted patents and have multiple pending patent applications in the United States, Canada, Europe and certain other countries covering digital transfer paper, abrasives and medical packaging, and other paper application and media processing. We also own more than 150 trademarks with registrations in approximately 80 countries. Our digital transfer patents have contributed to establishing the technical products business as a leading global supplier of digital transfer papers through our highly recognized JET-PRO®, JET-OPAQUE®, TECHNI-PRINT®, LASER-1-OPAQUE® and IMAGE CLIP® brands. We add even more depth and strength to our technical products portfolio with the well-recognized dye-sublimation JETCOL® brand, as well as our TEXCOLTM brand, which enables industrial transfer on natural substrates, supported by a pending patent, and our new FACECOL™ face mask media products. The KIMDURA® and MUNISING LP® trademarks have also made a significant contribution to the marketing of synthetic film and clean room papers for our technical products business.
For more than 100 years, Neenah’s fine paper and packaging business has built its market leading reputation on creating and manufacturing trademarked brands for premium writing, text, cover, digital, packaging, and specialty needs. The Neenah signature portfolio includes innovative, market leading brands such as CLASSIC® (including CLASSIC CREST®, CLASSIC® Linen, CLASSIC® Laid, CLASSIC COLUMNS®, CLASSIC® Stipple, CLASSIC® Woodgrain, and CLASSIC® Techweave), ASTROBRIGHTS®, ENVIRONMENT®, ROYAL SUNDANCE®, SOUTHWORTH® and many more. Our fine paper and packaging business provides unique and sustainable packaging papers, as well as custom solutions for premium packaging needs. With brands that stand for quality and consistency, such as NEENAH® Folding Board, NEENAH® Box Wrap, ESTATE LABEL®, and NEENAH IMAGEMAX® Paper Card, our fine paper and packaging business enables leading brands to deliver on their promise. The business accordingly maintains a well-rounded and respected portfolio of brands that position Neenah as an industry leader, setting standards for quality, consistency, and dependability.
Neenah also has significant trademarks recognized in both the publishing and packaging markets, including SKIVERTEX® and KIVAR®. 
The GESSNER® trademark similarly plays an important role in the marketing of Neenah’s filtration product lines. 
Human Capital
Our vision is to be a company known for manufacturing growth, for our customers, end-users, shareholders, and employees. Our talent strategy focuses on accelerating growth for our global employees by fostering a culture of possibility and cultivating the right people in the right roles with the right skills at the right time. We're doing this by continually evolving how we attract, engage, grow and reward our people.
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 2,239 regular full-time employees of whom 906 hourly and 476 salaried employees were located in the United States and 509 hourly and 348 salaried employees were located in Europe.
Certain employees of Neenah Germany are eligible to be represented by the Mining, Chemicals and Energy Trade Union, Industriegewerkschaft Bergbau, Chemie and Energie (the "IG BCE"). The IG BCE and a national trade association representing all employers in the industry signed a collective bargaining agreement covering union employees of Neenah Germany that expires in September 2022. Under German law union membership is voluntary and does not need to be disclosed to the Company. As a result, the number of employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement cannot be determined. In Netherlands, most of our employees are eligible to be represented by the Christelijke Nationale Vakbond ("CNV") and the Federatie Nederlandse Vakvereniging ("FNV"). Under Netherlands law, union membership is voluntary and does not need to be disclosed to the Company.
As of December 31, 2020, 85 employees are covered under collective bargaining agreements that expire in the next 12 months, not including the employees covered by the collective bargaining arrangements with the CNV and FNV. 
We believe we have satisfactory relations with our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements and do not expect the negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements to have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, "Commitments, Contingencies, and Legal Matters — Employees and Labor Relations."
Safety
"Safety Above All" is not just one of our company values, it is one of our strategic drivers. Our goal is to create a 100% safe work environment for our employees, and we are working towards this by focusing on three areas. First, we are deploying critical leadership behaviors and holding our leaders accountable to drive safety as a value. Second, we are expanding our risk assessment efforts to reduce injuries. Third, we are establishing global safety standards, by aligning our practices and procedures to ensure we are managing our efforts in a unified and consistent way.
COVID-19
Our commitment to safety was evident throughout 2020. We developed our protocols and action plans in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to help support our employees around the globe who were deemed essential. Some of the key actions taken included the following:
•Providing all hourly employees with additional paid sick days;
•Encouraging and providing employees with the flexibility to work from home;
•Adjusting attendance and sick leave policies to encourage those who are symptomatic, sick or who have been exposed to others with COVID-19 or COVID-19 symptoms to stay home;
•Increasing sanitization and cleaning protocols across all locations;
•Conducting regular meetings to review the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including ongoing updates to our health and safety protocols and procedures to address actual and suspected COVID-19 cases and potential exposures;
•Implementing temperature screening of employees and visitors at our manufacturing facilities;
•Establishing social distancing procedures for employees who need to be onsite;
•Providing additional cleaning supplies and personal protective equipment;
•Requiring employees to wear masks in all locations deemed necessary in accordance with local laws; and
•Prohibiting all domestic and international non-essential travel for all employees.
All our facilities manufacture products deemed essential to the critical infrastructure. As a result, during 2020 and currently, our production sites continue to operate during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We are committed to building and developing a diverse workforce and are proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer. We encourage applications from veterans, minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities. We take pride in our policies that provide equal employment opportunities to all qualified applicants, without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, protected veteran or disabled status or genetic information.
Neenah is also proud to establish Employee Resource Groups ("ERGs") to connect employees through shared identity or affinity. These groups are designed to provide networking opportunities for employees and create direct lines of communication between ERGs and leadership to address concerns, mitigate risks and solve problems.
Training and Development
Growing is at the heart of everything we do. Our company cannot grow if our people are not growing. That is why we recently launched a refreshed, consistent and simplified approach to talent management. The platform is called grow@Neenah. It is a framework that helps us set objectives, create a culture of ongoing feedback, differentiate and reward individual performance and create global learning and development opportunities. 
We also believe in recognizing our progress and celebrating success throughout our journey. We look for opportunities to identify our company values in action, reinforcing the behaviors we want people to display. When it comes to financial growth, we have harmonized our pay to be equitable based on each person's role in the organization. We are also migrating to an incentive model that allows for more meaningful reward opportunities based on individual contributions and company performance. 
Total Rewards
We aspire to be a different company, one that moves faster, thinks differently, and innovates in new ways. We know that our ideas contribute to a larger purpose. Through our efforts, distinctive user experiences are created across multiple categories and sectors. To create these possibilities and growth opportunities for our customers, end-users, and shareholders, we know that we must care for our employees' growth and well-being. To that end, we offer comprehensive benefits and well-being programs that support our employees' physical, financial, and emotional health and wellness. Our tools and resources include preventative services, fitness activities, counseling and educational resources, financial support as well as comprehensive medical, dental and vision coverage. We are committed to helping each employee feel their best so they can be their best.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances relating to various environmental, health and safety matters. We believe our operations are in compliance with, or we are taking actions designed to ensure compliance with, these laws, regulations and ordinances. However, the nature of our operations exposes us to the risk of claims concerning non-compliance with environmental, health and safety laws or standards, and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with those claims. Except for certain orders issued by environmental, health and safety regulatory agencies with which we believe we are in compliance and which we believe are immaterial to our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, we are not currently named as a party in any judicial or administrative proceeding relating to environmental, health and safety matters.
Greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions have increasingly become the subject of political and regulatory focus. Concern over potential climate change, including global warming, has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting GHG emissions. In addition to certain federal proposals in the United States to regulate GHG emissions, Germany, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and all the states in which we operate are currently considering GHG legislation or regulations, either individually and/or as part of regional initiatives. While not all such proposals will become law, it is likely that additional climate change related mandates will be forthcoming, and it is expected that they may adversely impact our costs by increasing energy costs and raw material prices, requiring operational or equipment modifications to reduce emissions and creating costs to comply with regulations or to mitigate the financial consequences of such compliance.
As a company, we work to minimize the amount of fresh water we use at our manufacturing facilities, and to recycle water within a facility as much as practically possible, all while maintaining stringent quality requirements. Due to the high quality achieved through efficient water treatment systems, our mills have the unique opportunity of being able to recycle and reuse fully treated effluent back into our process to minimize fresh water draws. Furthermore, our processes are designed to return the water used in manufacturing at a quality level that does not negatively impact the receiving environment.
While we have incurred in the past several years, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures in order to comply with environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and ordinances, we believe that our future cost of compliance with environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and ordinances, and our exposure to liability for environmental, health and safety claims will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, new legislation to limit GHG emissions or contamination of sites owned, operated or used for waste disposal by us (including currently unknown contamination and contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites or other waste generators) may give rise to additional costs which could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
Our anticipated capital expenditures for environmental projects are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
