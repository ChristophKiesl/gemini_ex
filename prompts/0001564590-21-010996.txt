 Item 1.  Business
 The Company is a Canadian corporation that was formed in March 1994 as a result of an amalgamation between WGIM Acquisition Corp. and the former IMAX Corporation (“Predecessor IMAX”). Predecessor IMAX was incorporated in 1967.
 As of December 31, 2020, the Company indirectly owns 69.89% of IMAX China Holding, Inc. (“IMAX China”), whose shares trade on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. IMAX China is a consolidated subsidiary of the Company.
 GENERAL
 IMAX is one of the world’s leading entertainment technology companies, specializing in technological innovations powering the presentation of some of today’s most immersive entertainment experiences. Through its proprietary software, theater architecture, patented intellectual property and specialized equipment, IMAX offers a unique end-to-end cinematic solution to create the highest-quality, most immersive motion picture and other entertainment event experiences for which the IMAX® brand has become globally known. Top filmmakers and movie studios utilize the cutting-edge visual and sound technology of IMAX to connect with audiences in innovative ways, and as a result, IMAX’s network is among the most important and successful distribution platforms for major films and other events around the world.
 The Company leverages its innovative technology and engineering in all aspects of its core business, which principally consists of the digital remastering of films and other presentations into the IMAX format (“IMAX DMR”) and the sale or lease of premium IMAX theater systems (“IMAX Theater Systems”). 
 IMAX Theater Systems are based on proprietary and patented image, audio and other technology developed over the course of the Company’s 53-year history. The Company’s customers are theater exhibitors that operate commercial theaters (particularly multiplexes), museums, science centers, or destination entertainment sites. The Company generally does not own the theaters in the IMAX network, but sells or leases the IMAX Theater System along with a license to use its trademarks.
 As of December 31, 2020, there were 1,650 IMAX Theater Systems operating in 84 countries and territories, including 1,562 commercial multiplexes, 12 commercial destinations and 76 institutional locations. This compares to 1,624 IMAX Theater Systems operating in 81 countries and territories as of December 31, 2019 including 1,529 commercial multiplexes, 14 commercial destinations and 81 institutional locations. (See the table below under “IMAX Network and Backlog” in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, for additional information on the composition of the IMAX network.)
 The IMAX Theater System provides the Company’s exhibitor customers with a combination of the following benefits:
  
• | the ability to exhibit content that has undergone the IMAX DMR® conversion process, which results in higher image and sound fidelity than conventional cinema experiences;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | advanced, high-resolution projectors with specialized equipment and automated theater control systems, which generate significantly more contrast and brightness than conventional theater systems;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | large screens and proprietary theater geometry, which result in a substantially larger field of view so that the screen extends to the edge of a viewer’s peripheral vision and creates more realistic images;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | advanced sound system components, which deliver more expansive sound imagery and pinpointed origination of sound to any specific spot in an IMAX theater;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | specialized theater acoustics, which result in a four-fold reduction in background noise; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a license to the globally recognized IMAX brand.
--+-------------------------------------------------

 In addition, certain movies shown in IMAX theaters are filmed using proprietary IMAX film and IMAX certified digital cameras, which offer filmmakers customized guidance and a workflow process to provide further enhanced and differentiated image quality and a film aspect ratio that delivers up to 26% more image onto a movie screen.

Together these components cause audiences in IMAX theaters to feel as if they are a part of the on-screen action, creating a more intense, immersive, and exciting experience than a traditional theater.
 As a result of the engineering and scientific achievements that are a hallmark of The IMAX Experience®, the Company’s exhibitor customers typically charge a premium for IMAX DMR films over films exhibited in their other auditoriums. The premium pricing, combined with the higher attendance levels associated with IMAX DMR films, generates incremental box office for the Company’s exhibitor customers and for the movie studios releasing their films to the IMAX network. The incremental box office generated by IMAX DMR films has helped establish IMAX as a key premium distribution and marketing platform for Hollywood blockbuster films. 
 As one of the world’s leaders in entertainment technology, the Company strives to remain at the forefront of advancements in cinema technology. In 2018, the Company introduced IMAX with Laser, a laser projection system designed for IMAX theaters in commercial multiplexes, which represents a further evolution of IMAX’s proprietary technology. The Company believes that IMAX with Laser delivers increased resolution, sharper and brighter images, deeper contrast as well as the widest range of colors available to filmmakers today. The Company further believes that IMAX with Laser is helping facilitate the next major lease renewal and upgrade cycle for the global IMAX network.
 The Company is also experimenting with new technologies and new content as a way to deepen consumer engagement and brand loyalty, which includes curating unique, differentiated alternative content to be exhibited in IMAX theaters, particularly during those periods when Hollywood blockbuster film content is not available. 
 IMPACT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC
 In late January 2020, in response to the public health risks associated with the novel coronavirus and the disease that it causes (“COVID-19”), the Chinese government directed exhibitors in China to temporarily close more than 70,000 movie theaters, including all of the approximately 700 IMAX theaters in mainland China. On March 11, 2020, due to the worsening public health crisis associated with the novel coronavirus, COVID-19 was characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization, and in the following weeks, local, state and national governments instituted stay-at-home orders and restrictions on large public gatherings which caused movie theaters in countries around the world to temporarily close, including substantially all of the IMAX theaters in those countries. As a result of the theater closures, movie studios postponed the theatrical release of most films originally scheduled for release in 2020 and early 2021, including many scheduled to be shown in IMAX theaters, while several other films were released directly or concurrently to streaming platforms. More recently, stay-at-home orders have been lifted in many countries and movie theaters throughout the IMAX network gradually reopened in the third quarter of 2020 with reduced capacities, physical distancing requirements, and other safety measures. As of December 31, 2020, 71% of the theaters in the IMAX commercial multiplex network were open, spanning 41 countries. This included 44% of the theaters in Domestic (i.e., United States and Canada) locations, 97% of the theaters in Greater China and 53% of the theaters in Rest of World markets. In many parts of Asia, audiences have returned to theaters, particularly IMAX theaters, in numbers consistent with pre-pandemic attendance levels despite the continued delay of Hollywood theatrical releases, which typically account for 70% of box office ticket sales in those regions. Management believes this indicates that moviegoers are eager to return to cinemas where and when theaters are open and moviegoers feel safe. However, ticket sales have been significantly lower than normal levels in theaters outside of Asia as Hollywood movie studios have further delayed the theatrical release dates for a number of films. As a result, certain theater chains have remained closed or have reduced their operating hours. In addition, theaters in major markets remain temporarily closed.

The repercussions of the COVID-19 global pandemic resulted in a significant decrease in the Company’s revenues, earnings and operating cash flows in 2020 as gross box office (“GBO”) results from the Company’s theater customers declined significantly, the installation of certain theater systems was delayed, and maintenance services were generally suspended for theaters that were closed. While there continues to be a lack of new films released by movie studios and a significant number of theaters in the IMAX network are closed, the Company is experiencing a significant decline in earnings and operating cash flows as it is generating significantly lower than normal levels of GBO-based revenue from its joint revenue sharing arrangements and digital remastering services, it is unable to provide normal maintenance services to any of the theaters that remain closed, and while some installation activity is continuing, certain theater system installations have, and may continue to be delayed. In addition, the Company has experienced and is likely to continue to experience delays in collecting payments due under existing theater sale or lease arrangements from its exhibitor customers who are facing financial difficulties as a result of the theater closures. In response, the Company has provided temporary relief to exhibitor customers by waiving or reducing maintenance fees during periods when theaters are closed or operating with reduced capacities and, in certain situations, by providing extended payment terms on annual minimum payment obligations in exchange for a corresponding or longer extension of the term of the underlying sale or lease arrangement. In 2020, the Company increased its provision for current expected credit losses by $18.6 million, in part reflecting a reduction in the credit quality of its theater related accounts receivable, financing receivables and variable consideration receivables, which management believes is primarily related to the COVID-19 pandemic and adequately addresses the risk of not collecting these receivables in full.
Management is encouraged by recent box office results in markets like China, Japan and South Korea where the virus is under control and audiences have demonstrated a willingness to return to cinema. However, the Company may continue to be significantly impacted by the COVID-19 global pandemic even after a significant portion or all theaters are reopened. The global economic impact of COVID-19 has led to record levels of unemployment in certain countries, which has led to, and may continue to result in lower consumer spending. The timing and extent of a recovery of consumer behavior and willingness to spend discretionary income on movie-going may delay the Company’s ability to generate significant GBO-based revenue until consumer behavior normalizes and consumer spending recovers. 
 In response to uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 global pandemic, the Company has taken and is continuing to take significant steps to preserve cash by eliminating non-essential costs, placing certain employees on a temporary furlough, reducing the working hours of other employees and reducing all non-essential capital expenditures to minimum levels. 
 The Company has also implemented an active cash management process, which, among other things, requires senior management approval of all outgoing payments. In addition, in the first quarter of 2020, the Company drew down $280.0 million in remaining available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility provided by its Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (both as defined in Part II, Item 7, “Liquidity and Capital Resources”), which was then amended in June 2020 to, among other things, suspend the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio financial covenant in the Credit Agreement through the first quarter of 2021 and substitute quarterly EBITDA from the third and fourth quarters of 2019 in lieu of the EBITDA for the corresponding quarters of 2020 to meet the original Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio financial covenant. 
 As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all of its requirements under the Credit Agreement, as amended. The Company’s continued compliance with the requirements of the Credit Agreement will depend on the Company’s ability to generate sufficient EBITDA to ensure compliance with the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio covenant throughout the next twelve months, which is dependent on the timing of when theaters in the IMAX network resume normal operations. The risk of breaching this covenant within the next twelve months increases significantly as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely impact the Company’s ability to generate EBITDA. A violation of this covenant would represent an event of default under the terms of the Credit Agreement, allowing lenders to declare the principal and interest on all outstanding Credit Facility indebtedness due or payable immediately. If a breach of the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio covenant were to occur, however, management believes the Company would be able to either reduce a sufficient portion of the drawn amount on the Credit Facility with existing cash balances to achieve compliance, obtain additional sources of liquidity prior to the time when the repayment of its outstanding Credit Facility indebtedness would be required, or negotiate a further amendment with its lenders to the Credit Agreement to provide further covenant relief.
 Furthermore, the Company has applied for and received wage subsidies, tax credits and other financial support under COVID-19 relief legislation that has been enacted in the countries in which it operates. During 2020, the Company recognized $6.4 million in benefits from the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (“CEWS”) program and $0.7 million in benefits from the U.S. CARES Act, as reductions to Selling, General and Administrative Expenses ($6.0 million), Costs and Expenses Applicable to Revenues ($1.0 million) and Research and Development ($0.1 million) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The CEWS program has been extended to June 2021. The Company will continue to review and apply for additional subsidies and credits for the remaining terms of these programs, where applicable.

In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test considering the latest available information and determined that its goodwill was not impaired. As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s total Goodwill was $39.0 million, of which $19.1 million relates to the IMAX Systems reporting unit, $13.5 million relates to the Joint Revenue Sharing Arrangement reporting unit, and $6.4 million relates to the IMAX Maintenance reporting unit. The impairment test was performed on a reporting unit level by comparing each unit’s carrying value, including goodwill, to its fair value. The carrying value of each reporting unit is based on a systematic and rational allocation of certain assets and liabilities. The fair value of each reporting unit is assessed using a discounted cash flow model based on management’s current short-term forecast and estimated long-term projections, against which various sensitivity analyses are performed. The discount rates used in the cash flow model are derived based on the Company’s estimated weighted average cost of capital. These estimates and the likelihood of future changes in these estimates depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes. Actual results may differ materially from management’s estimates, especially due to the uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. (See “Critical Accounting Estimates” in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.)
 In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company also updated its recoverability tests of the carrying values of the theater system equipment supporting its joint revenue sharing arrangements, which are recorded within Property, Plant and Equipment. In performing its reviews of recoverability, the Company estimated the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets. The cash flow estimates used in these tests are consistent with management’s estimated long-term projections, against which various sensitivity analyses were performed. These estimates are highly uncertain due to the COVID-19 global pandemic; therefore, management’s estimated cash flows factor in a number of underlying variables and ranges of possible cash flow scenarios. Actual results may differ materially from management’s estimates, especially due to the uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded impairment losses of $0.3 million related to the theater system equipment supporting its joint revenue sharing arrangements. (See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.)
 In the third quarter of 2020, the Company assessed the recoverability of its deferred tax assets and recorded a $23.7 million valuation allowance to reduce the value of deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was recorded in the jurisdictions where management could not reliably forecast that future tax liabilities would arise within the next five years, primarily due to the uncertainties around the long-term impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company increased the valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets by $4.9 million due to additional losses recorded in the period. The valuation allowance is expected to reverse when the Company determines it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions will be realized. Despite this valuation allowance, the Company remains entitled to benefit from the tax attributes which currently have a valuation allowance applied to them.
 If business conditions deteriorate further, or should they remain depressed for a more prolonged period of time, management’s estimates of operating results and future cash flows for the IMAX Systems and Joint Revenue Sharing Arrangements reporting units may be insufficient to support the goodwill assigned to them, thus requiring impairment charges. The Company will continue to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, estimates related to future expected credit losses and the recoverability of deferred tax assets, as well as the recoverability of joint revenue sharing equipment assets and the realization of variable consideration assets, could also be further impacted by changes in management’s estimates. (see Notes 3, 5 and 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8).
 (See “Risk Factors – The Company has experienced a significant decrease in its revenues, earnings and cash flows due to the COVID-19 global pandemic and its business, financial condition and results of operations may continue to be significantly harmed in future reporting periods” in Part I, Item 1A, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic” in Part II, Item 7, and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.)
 IMAX NETWORK
 The Company believes the IMAX network is one of the most extensive premium networks in the world with 1,650 IMAX Theater Systems operating in 84 countries and territories, including 1,562 commercial multiplex, 12 commercial destination and 76 institutional locations as of December 31, 2020. (See the table below under “IMAX Network and Backlog” in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, for additional information on the composition of the IMAX network.)
 7

The Company currently believes that over time its commercial multiplex network could grow to approximately 3,318 IMAX theaters worldwide from the 1,562 commercial multiplex IMAX theaters operating as of December 31, 2020. The Company believes that the majority of its future growth will come from international markets. As of December 31, 2020, 72.8% of IMAX Theater Systems in operation were located within international markets (defined as all countries other than the United States and Canada), an increase from 71.9% as of December 31, 2019, and approximately 86.0% of the new IMAX Theater Systems in backlog are scheduled to be installed in international markets, compared to 85.7% as of December 31, 2019. Revenues and gross box office derived from international markets continue to exceed revenues and gross box office from the United States and Canada. This was especially true during 2020 as the pace and extent of the reopening of IMAX theaters in Greater China amidst the COVID-19 global pandemic exceeded that of theaters in Domestic (i.e., United States and Canada) and Rest of World markets. (See “Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic” above.)
 Greater China is the Company’s largest market, measured by revenues, with approximately 38% and 31% of overall revenues generated from its Greater China operations in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 745 theaters operating in Greater China and an additional 238 new theaters (plus 13 upgrades) in backlog that are scheduled to be installed in Greater China by 2028. The Company’s backlog in Greater China represents 47.6% of its total current backlog, including upgrades. The Company’s largest single international partnership is in China with Wanda Film (“Wanda”). Wanda’s total commitment to the Company is for 361 IMAX Theater Systems in Greater China (of which 347 IMAX Theater Systems are under the parties’ joint revenue sharing arrangement). (See “Risk Factors – The Company faces risks in connection with its significant presence in China and the continued expansion of its business there” in Part I, Item 1A.) 
 (See “Risk Factors – The Company has experienced a significant decrease in its revenues, earnings and cash flows due to the COVID-19 global pandemic and its business, financial condition and results of operations may continue to be significantly harmed in future reporting periods” in Part I, Item 1A.)
 PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
 The Company believes it is the world’s largest designer and manufacturer of specialty premium projection and sound system components for large-format theaters around the world, and it is also a significant distributor of large-format films. The Company’s theater systems include specialized IMAX projectors, advanced sound systems and specialty screens.
 The Company’s principal products and services are as follows:
 
 
• | IMAX DMR – The digital remastering of films and other content into IMAX formats for distribution to the IMAX network.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | IMAX Theater Systems – The sale or lease of premium IMAX Theater Systems to exhibitor customers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | IMAX Maintenance – The provision of proactive and emergency maintenance services to the IMAX network.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | New Business Initiatives – Activities principally related to the exploration of new lines of business and new initiatives outside of the Company’s core business that are in the development and/or start-up phases.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other – The distribution of large-format documentary films, primarily to institutional theaters, the provision of film post-production services, and after-market sales of IMAX projection system parts and 3D glasses.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These product lines do not fully reflect the nature and sources of revenue, or the manner in which management reviews financial information. The Company’s segment information is provided in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 21 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.
 IMAX DMR
 The Company has developed IMAX DMR, a proprietary technology that digitally remasters Hollywood films into IMAX formats. IMAX DMR digitally enhances the image resolution of motion picture films for projection on IMAX screens while maintaining or enhancing the visual clarity and sound quality to levels for which The IMAX Experience is known. In addition, the original soundtrack of a film to be exhibited in IMAX theaters is remastered for IMAX digital sound systems in connection with the IMAX DMR release of the film. Unlike the soundtracks played in conventional theaters, IMAX remastered soundtracks are uncompressed and full fidelity. IMAX sound systems use proprietary loudspeaker systems and proprietary surround sound configurations that ensure every theater seat is in an optimal listening position.

The IMAX DMR process involves: 
 
 
• | in certain instances, scanning, at the highest possible resolution, each individual frame of the movie and converting it into a digital image;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | optimizing the image using proprietary image enhancement tools;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | enhancing the digital image using techniques such as sharpening, color correction, grain and noise removal and the elimination of unsteadiness and removal of unwanted artifacts;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | recording the enhanced digital image into an IMAX digital cinema package (“DCP”) format or onto IMAX 15/70-format film; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | specially remastering the soundtrack to take full advantage of the unique sound system of IMAX Theater Systems.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 IMAX films also benefit from enhancements made by individual filmmakers exclusively for the IMAX release of the film. Collectively, the Company refers to these enhancements as “IMAX DNA”. Filmmakers and movie studios have sought IMAX-specific enhancements in recent years to generate interest in and excitement for their films. Such enhancements include shooting films with IMAX cameras to increase the audience’s immersion in the film and taking advantage of the unique dimensions of the IMAX screen by projecting the film in a larger aspect ratio that delivers up to 26% more image onto a movie screen. Avengers: Endgame, the highest-grossing film in history, released in April 2019, was shot entirely using IMAX cameras. In 2020, Universal Pictures’ 1917 was released with select scenes specifically formatted for IMAX screens, Warner Bros. Pictures’ Tenet was filmed with IMAX cameras, and Warner Bros. Pictures’ Wonder Woman 1984, released globally in December 2020, was partially shot with IMAX cameras. In addition, Bona Film’s The Rescue, which was released in China in December 2020, has an expanded aspect ratio that is exclusive to IMAX. 
 The Company remains in active negotiations with all major Hollywood studios for additional films to fill out its short and long-term film slate for the IMAX network. However, as a result of the theater closures associated with the COVID-19 global pandemic, Hollywood movie studios have postponed the theatrical release of most films originally scheduled for release in 2020 and early 2021, including many scheduled to be shown in IMAX theaters, while several other films have been released directly or concurrently to streaming platforms. Accordingly, as of the filing of this report, there remains uncertainty around the release dates of certain major films.
 IMAX Theater Systems
 The Company’s primary products are its IMAX Theater Systems, which are either sold or leased to exhibitor customers along with a license for the use of the globally recognized IMAX brand. The Company’s digital projection systems include a projector that offers superior image quality and stability and a digital theater control system; a digital audio system delivering up to 12,000 watts of sound; a screen with a proprietary coating technology, and, if applicable, 3D glasses cleaning equipment. IMAX’s digital projection system also operates without the need for analog film prints. As part of the arrangement to sell or lease its IMAX Theater Systems, the Company provides extensive advice on theater planning and design, and supervision of installation services. 
 The Company’s digital projection systems provides a premium and differentiated experience to moviegoers that is consistent with what they have come to expect from the IMAX brand, while providing exhibitor customers with the compelling economics and flexibility that digital technology affords.
 The terms of each sale or lease arrangement vary according to the configuration of the IMAX Theater System, as well as the cinema and film distribution markets relevant to the geographic location of the customer.
 Revenue from sale or lease of IMAX Theater Systems may be recognized at a different time from when cash is collected from the exhibitor customer. (See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Part II, Item 7 and Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion on the Company’s revenue recognition policies.)

----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Reflects contractual upfront payments. Future contingent payments are not reflected as these are based on negotiated shares of box office results.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The number of IMAX Theater Systems in the backlog reflects the minimum number of commitments under signed contracts. The dollar value fluctuates depending on the number of new arrangements signed from year-to-year, which adds to backlog, and the installation and acceptance of IMAX Theater Systems and the settlement of contracts, both of which reduce backlog. Backlog typically represents the fixed contracted revenue under signed IMAX Theater System sale and lease agreements that the Company believes will be recognized as revenue upon installation and acceptance of the associated system, as well as an estimate of variable consideration in sales arrangements, however it excludes amounts allocated to maintenance and extended warranty revenues. The value of backlog does not include revenue from theaters in which the Company has an equity interest, operating leases and long-term conditional theater commitments. Theaters under joint revenue sharing arrangements do not usually have dollar value backlog, although certain IMAX Theater Systems under joint revenue sharing arrangements provide for contracted upfront payments and therefore carry a backlog value based on those payments. The Company believes that the contractual obligations for IMAX Theater System installations that are listed in backlog are valid and binding commitments. 
 From time to time, in the normal course of its business, the Company will have customers who are unable to proceed with an IMAX Theater System installation for a variety of reasons, including the inability to obtain certain consents, approvals or financing. Once the determination is made that the customer will not proceed with installation, the agreement with the customer is terminated or amended. If the agreement is terminated, once the Company and the customer are released from all their future obligations under the agreement, all or a portion of the initial rents or fees that the customer previously made to the Company are recognized as revenue.

IMAX Flat Screen and IMAX Dome Theater Systems   
 IMAX flat screen and IMAX dome systems have been installed primarily in institutions such as museums and science centers. Flat screen IMAX theaters were introduced in 1970, while IMAX dome theaters, which are designed for tilted dome screens, were introduced in 1973. There have been several significant proprietary and patented enhancements to these systems since their introduction. As of December 31, 2020, there were 33 IMAX flat screen and IMAX dome theater systems in the IMAX network, as compared to 40 IMAX flat screen and IMAX dome theater systems as of December 31, 2019.  With the introduction of digital IMAX Theater Systems, there has been a decrease in the number of IMAX flat screen and IMAX dome theaters in the network. With the introduction of laser-based digital systems, the Company has been able to create a new Laser Dome solution for its institutional customers. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had installed six IMAX with Laser Domes, which are included in the table above. 
 IMAX 3D GT and IMAX 3D SR Theater Systems  
 IMAX 3D theaters utilize a flat screen 3D system, which produces realistic 3D images on an IMAX screen. As of December 31, 2020, there were 14 IMAX 3D GT and IMAX 3D SR Theater Systems in operation compared to 17 IMAX 3D GT and IMAX 3D SR Theater Systems in operation as of December 31, 2019. The decrease in the number of 3D GT and 3D SR Theater Systems is largely attributable to theater closures during the year.
 IMAX Digital: Xenon Theater Systems  
 The Company believes that its xenon-based digital projection system delivers high quality imagery compared with other xenon systems. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 1,377 xenon-based digital theater systems in the network and had an additional 273 xenon-based digital theater systems in its backlog. 
IMAX Digital: Laser Theater Systems 
 At the end of 2014, the Company introduced its laser-based digital projection system. As a result of continued research and development aimed at creating a solution that is more affordable for its commercial multiplex partners, the Company rolled out IMAX with Laser in 2018, the Company’s laser projection system designed for IMAX theaters in commercial multiplexes. The Company believes IMAX laser-based digital projectors present greater brightness and clarity, higher contrast, a wider color gamut and deeper blacks, consume less power and last longer than other digital projection technologies, and are capable of illuminating the largest screens in the IMAX network. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 66 GT laser-based digital systems as compared to 63 as of December 31, 2019 in the IMAX network. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 160 IMAX with Laser systems as compared to 130 as of December 31, 2019 in the IMAX network.
 IMAX Maintenance
 For all IMAX theaters, theater owners or operators are also responsible for paying the Company an annual maintenance and extended warranty fee. Under these arrangements, the Company provides proactive and emergency maintenance services to every theater in its network to ensure that each presentation is up to the highest IMAX quality standard. Annual maintenance fees are paid throughout the duration of the term of the theater agreements. (See “Maintenance and Extended Warranty Services” below.)

New Business Initiatives
 The New Business Initiatives segment includes activities related to the exploration of new lines of business and new initiatives outside of the Company’s core business, which seek to leverage its proprietary, innovative technologies, its leadership position in the entertainment technology space and its unique relationship with content creators. Such new business initiatives currently include IMAX Enhanced and Connected Theaters, as discussed below.
 IMAX Enhanced
 The Company has developed a new home entertainment licensing and certification program called IMAX Enhanced. This initiative was launched along with audio leader DTS (an Xperi subsidiary), capitalizing on the companies’ decades of combined expertise in image and sound science. IMAX Enhanced brings IMAX digitally re-mastered 4K high dynamic range (HDR) content and DTS audio technologies to premier streaming platforms and best-in-class consumer electronics devices worldwide, offering consumers high-fidelity sight and sound experiences for the home. 
 To be certified, leading consumer electronics manufacturers spanning 4K/8K televisions, projectors, A/V receivers, loudspeakers, subwoofers and soundbars must meet a carefully prescribed set of audio and video performance standards, set by a certification committee of IMAX and DTS engineers and some of Hollywood’s leading technical specialists.
 IMAX Enhanced global device partners include Sony Electronics, Hisense, TCL, Phillips, Sound United among others. By March 2021, IMAX Enhanced will have over six million certified devices in-market. IMAX Enhanced content is now available on six streaming platforms worldwide, with partners that include Sony Pictures Entertainment, Paramount Pictures, Huayi Brothers, Bona Film Group, Tencent Video, iQIYI and FandangoNOW, with more on the way.
 Connected Theaters 
 
The Company is currently exploring new technologies and forms of content as a way to deepen consumer engagement and brand loyalty, including new technologies to further connect the IMAX network and to facilitate bringing more unique content, including live events, to IMAX theater audiences. The Company believes such additional connectivity can provide more innovative content to the IMAX network and in turn permit the Company to engage audiences in new ways.
 The Company continues to believe that the IMAX network serves as a valuable platform to launch and distribute original content, especially during periods between peak and off-peak seasons, known as "shoulder periods". 
 Other
 Through the Film Distribution segment, the Company licenses film content and distributes large-format documentary films, primarily for its institutional theater partners. The Company receives as its distribution fee either a fixed amount or a fixed percentage of the theater box office receipts and following the Company’s recoupment of its costs the Company typically is entitled to receive an additional percentage of gross revenues as participation revenues. The Company released the IMAX original production, Asteroid Hunters, in October 2020.
The ownership rights to such films may be held by the film sponsors, the film investors and/or the Company. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has distribution rights with respect to 52 such films, which cover subjects such as space, wildlife, music, sports, history and natural wonders.
 Through the Film Post-Production segment, the Company provides film post-production and quality control services for large-format films (whether produced by IMAX or third parties), and digital post-production services. 
 The Company derives a small portion of its revenues from other sources including: one owned and operated IMAX theater in Sacramento, California; a commercial arrangement with one theater resulting in the sharing of profits and losses; the provision of management services to three other theaters; renting its proprietary 2D and 3D large-format film and digital cameras to third-party production companies; and also offering production advice and technical assistance to both documentary and Hollywood filmmakers.

MARKETING AND CUSTOMERS 
 The Company markets IMAX Theater Systems through a direct sales force and marketing staff located in offices in Canada, the United States, Greater China, Europe and Asia. In addition, the Company has agreements with consultants, business brokers and real estate professionals to locate potential customers and theater sites for the Company on a commission basis. 
 Commercial multiplex theaters are the largest part of the IMAX network, comprising 1,562 IMAX theaters, or 94.7%, of the 1,650 IMAX theaters in the IMAX network as of December 31, 2020. The Company’s institutional customers include science and natural history museums, zoos, aquaria and other educational and cultural centers. The Company also sells or leases IMAX Theater Systems to commercial destinations such as theme parks, private home theaters, tourist destination sites, fairs and expositions. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 72.8% of all open IMAX theaters were in locations outside of the United States and Canada.

See “Risk Factors – The Company conducts business internationally, which exposes it to uncertainties and risks that could negatively affect its operations, sales and future growth prospects” and “Risk Factors – The Company faces risks in connection with its significant presence in China and the continued expansion of its business there” in Item 1A. The Company’s largest customer, Wanda, as of December 31, 2020, represents 35.1% (2019 ― 33.9%) of the Company’s network of theaters, 19.0% (2019 ― 25.6%) of the Company’s theater system backlog and 16.4% (2019 ― 16.5%) of its revenues.)
 INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
 Competition
 The out-of-home entertainment industry is very competitive, and the Company faces a number of competitive challenges. In recent years, for instance, exhibitors and entertainment technology companies have introduced their own branded, large-screen 3D auditoriums or other proprietary theater systems, some of which include laser-based projectors, and in many cases, have marketed those auditoriums or theater systems as having similar quality or attributes to an IMAX Theater System. The Company believes that all of these alternative formats deliver images and experiences that are inferior to The IMAX Experience.  
 13

The Company may continue to face competition in the future from companies in the entertainment industry with new technologies and/or substantially greater capital resources to develop and support them. The Company also faces in-home competition from a number of alternative motion picture distribution channels such as subscription streaming services, transactional video-on-demand (both rentals and sales), advertiser-supported video-on-demand, pay-per-view, Blu-ray Disc, and broadcast and cable television. During the COVID-19 pandemic, with theaters closed in many global markets, certain movie studios have released several high-profile films directly or concurrently to streaming platforms rather than exclusively to theaters within the traditional theatrical release window. While there can be no assurances whether or when this practice will end once the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic recede, several Hollywood studios have recently reiterated their commitment to maintaining exclusive theatrical release windows. The Company further competes for the public’s leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment, including gaming, sporting events, concerts, live theater, social media and restaurants.
 The Company believes that its competitive strengths include the value of the IMAX brand name, the premium IMAX consumer experience, the design, quality and historic reliability rate of IMAX Theater Systems, the return on investment of an IMAX Theater System for exhibitors, the number and quality of IMAX films that it distributes, the relationships the Company maintains with prominent Hollywood and international filmmakers (a number of whom desire to film their movies with IMAX cameras) the quality of the sound system components included with an IMAX Theater System, the availability of Hollywood and international event films to IMAX theaters through IMAX DMR technology, consumer loyalty and the level of the Company’s service and maintenance and extended warranty efforts. The Company believes that its laser-based projection system increases further the technological superiority of the consumer experience it delivers. As a result, the Company believes that virtually all of the best performing premium theaters in the world are IMAX theaters.
 Exhibitor Consolidation
 The Company’s primary customers are commercial multiplex exhibitors. The commercial exhibition industry has undergone significant consolidation, with Wanda’s acquisitions of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (“AMC”) and Hoyts Group in 2012 and 2015, respectively, and AMC’s acquisition of Carmike Cinemas and Odeon & UCI Cinemas Group (“Odeon”), which includes Nordic Cinema Group (“Nordic”), in 2016. In recent years, the industry has continued to consolidate, as evidenced by Cineworld Group’s acquisition of Regal Entertainment Group (“Regal”), the Company’s second largest customer.
 The Company believes that recent exhibitor consolidation has helped facilitate the growth of the IMAX network. The Company has historically enjoyed strong relationships with large commercial exhibitor chains, which have greater capital to purchase, lease or otherwise acquire IMAX Theater Systems. As larger commercial chains such as AMC have purchased smaller chains, those smaller chains have in turn become part of the IMAX network. For instance, following AMC’s acquisition of Odeon and Nordic, the Company and AMC entered into an agreement for 25 new IMAX Theater Systems across the Odeon and Nordic network. The Company believes that continued consolidation could facilitate further signings and other strategic benefits going forward.
 However, exhibitor consolidation has also resulted in individual exhibitor chains constituting a material portion of the Company’s revenue and network. Continued industry consolidation, as well as consolidation in the movie studio industry, may present risks to the Company. (See “Risk Factors – Consolidation among commercial exhibitors and studios reduces the breadth of the Company’s customer base, and could result in a narrower market for the Company’s products and reduced negotiating leverage. A deterioration in the Company’s relationship with key partners could materially, adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operation. In addition, an adverse economic impact on a significant customer’s business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on the Company.” in Part I, Item 1A.)
 THE IMAX BRAND
 IMAX is a world leader in entertainment technology. The Company relies on its brand to communicate its leadership and singular goal of creating entertainment experiences that exceed all expectations. Top filmmakers and studios use the IMAX brand to message that a film will connect with audiences in unique and extraordinary ways. In 2020, IMAX launched the “Filmed in IMAX” program, a new partnership with the world's leading camera manufacturers to meet filmmaker demand for The IMAX Experience. Through the program, IMAX will certify high-end, best-in-class digital cameras with leading brands including ARRI, Panavision, RED Digital Cinema and Sony to work in the IMAX format when paired with its proprietary post-production process. 
 14

The IMAX brand is a promise to deliver what today’s movie audiences crave — a memorable, more emotionally engaging, more thrilling and shareable experience. Consumer research conducted in six countries worldwide by a leading third-party research firm shows that the IMAX brand has near universal awareness, creates a special experience and is one of the most differentiated movie-going brands. On a standardized measure of brand equity, the IMAX brand ranged from two to 10 times more powerful than other entertainment technology brands. The Company believes that its strong brand equity supports consumers’ predisposition to choose IMAX over competing brands and to pay a premium for The IMAX Experience now and into the future. 
 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 The Company believes that it is one of the world’s leading entertainment technology companies with significant proprietary expertise in digital and film-based projection and sound system component design, engineering and imaging technology, particularly in laser-based technology. The Company rolled out its flagship laser-based projection system at the end of 2014, which is capable of illuminating the largest screens in the Company’s network. This laser-based projection system provides greater brightness and clarity, higher contrast, a wider color gamut and deeper blacks, while consuming less power and lasting longer than existing digital technology, to ensure that the Company continues to provide the highest quality, premier movie going experience available to consumers. In 2018, the Company rolled-out IMAX with Laser, the Company’s next generation laser-based projection system, which is targeted primarily for screens in commercial multiplexes. With most of the laser development completed, the related research and development spending has declined in recent years. 
 The Company plans to continue research and development activity in the future in other areas considered important to its continued commercial success, including further improving the reliability of and costs associated with its projectors; enhancing its image quality; expanding the applicability of its digital technology in both theater and home entertainment; developing IMAX Theater Systems’ capabilities, including through its Connected Theaters initiative; and improving its proprietary DMR process. The Company expects its research and development efforts to center around innovation projects and DMR enhancements in 2021.
 As of December 31, 2020, 45 of the Company’s employees were connected with research and development projects, compared to 52 employees as of December 31, 2019. 
 MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE 
 Projector Component Manufacturing
 The Company assembles the projector of IMAX Theater Systems at its facility in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada (near Toronto). The Company develops and designs all of the key elements of the proprietary technology involved in this component. Fabrication of a majority of parts and sub-assemblies is subcontracted to a group of carefully pre-qualified third-party suppliers. Manufacture and supply contracts are signed for the delivery of the component on an order-by-order basis. The Company believes its significant suppliers will continue to supply quality products in quantities sufficient to satisfy its needs. The Company inspects all parts and sub-assemblies, completes the final assembly and then subjects the projector to comprehensive testing individually and as a system prior to shipment. Historically, these projectors, including both the Company’s xenon and laser-based projection systems, have had reliability rates based on scheduled shows of approximately 99%.
Sound System Component Manufacturing
 The Company develops, designs and assembles the key elements of its theater sound system component. The standard IMAX theater sound system component comprises parts from a variety of sources, with approximately 50% of the materials of each sound system attributable to proprietary parts provided under original equipment manufacturers agreements with outside vendors. These proprietary parts include custom loudspeaker enclosures and horns, specialized amplifiers, and signal processing and control equipment. The Company inspects all parts and sub-assemblies, completes the final assembly and then subjects the sound system to comprehensive testing as a system.
Screen and Other Components
 The Company purchases its screen component and glasses cleaning equipment from third parties. The standard screen system component is comprised of a projection screen manufactured to IMAX specifications and a frame to hang the projection screen. The proprietary glasses cleaning machine is a stand-alone unit that is connected to the theater’s water and electrical supply to automate the cleaning of 3D glasses.
 15

Maintenance and Extended Warranty Services
 The Company also provides ongoing maintenance and extended warranty services to IMAX Theater Systems. These arrangements are usually for a separate fee, although the Company often includes free service in the initial year of an arrangement. The maintenance and extended warranty arrangements include service, maintenance and replacement parts for IMAX Theater Systems.
 To support the IMAX network, the Company has personnel stationed in major markets throughout the world who provide periodic and emergency maintenance and extended warranty services on existing IMAX Theater Systems. The Company provides various levels of maintenance and warranty services, which are priced accordingly. Under full-service programs, Company personnel typically visit each theater every six months to provide preventative maintenance, cleaning and inspection services and emergency visits to resolve problems and issues with the theater system. Under some arrangements, customers can elect to participate in a service partnership program whereby the Company trains a customer’s technician to carry out certain aspects of maintenance. Under such shared maintenance arrangements, the Company participates in certain of the customer’s maintenance checks each year, provides a specified number of emergency visits and provides spare parts, as necessary. For both xenon and laser-based digital systems, the Company provides pre-emptive maintenance, remote system monitoring and a network operations center that provides continuous access to product experts.

Employee Health and Safety
 Recognizing the various employee heath and safety risks associated with the delivery of the world’s most immersive movie-going experience, the Company has implemented a global program for workplace safety that ensures it has the necessary controls in place to strive to keep its employees and visitors safe. 
 Employee heath and safety at the Company is a shared responsibility that requires continuous effort.  Risks to the health and safety of the Company’s employees are present in day-to-day office work, building renovation, manufacturing, logistics, training, testing, research and development, and during the designing, installation and service of the Company’s theaters around the world. Every employee at each IMAX location, workplace, business unit and department is responsible for participating in workplace safety planning activities and managers are responsible for employee health and safety program implementation for their business function. This effort is supported by a cross-functional Heath and Safety team dedicated to employee health and safety and business continuity. 

17

This relentless focus and commitment to the health and safety of the Company’s employees was never more evident than in the Company’s approach to COVID-19. Specifically, the Company:
  
• | Instituted a cross-functional Pandemic Response team to support decision making and implementation of COVID-19 response programs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Supported a quick pivot to a virtual workplace and scheduling flexibility to meet competing personal demands.
