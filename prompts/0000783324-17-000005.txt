     ITEM 1.  BUSINESS. 
     Overview
     Vista Gold Corp. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Vista,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) are engaged in the gold mining industry. We are focused on the evaluation, acquisition, exploration and advancement of gold exploration and potential development projects, which may lead to gold production or value adding strategic transactions such as earn-in right agreements, option agreements, leases to third parties, joint venture arrangements with other mining companies, or outright sales of assets for cash and/or other consideration.  We look for opportunities to improve the value of our gold projects through exploration drilling and/or technical studies focused on optimizing previous engineering work. We do not currently generate cash flows from mining operations.
     The Company’s flagship asset is its 100% owned Mt Todd gold project (“Mt Todd”) in the Northern Territory (“NT”) Australia, where we are seeking approval of our final environmental authorization and evaluating potential material process improvements in anticipation of commencing an update of our July 2014 Preliminary Feasibility Study (“PFS”). 
     Ultimately, a development decision at Mt Todd will depend on several factors, principally a sustainable acceptable gold price, a favorable outlook for the AUD:USD exchange rate, completion of a positive feasibility study and the availability of financing.  With 60%-70% of the project capital and operating costs denominated in Australian dollars, the current AUD:USD exchange rate has a material favorable impact on the project economics, substantially mitigating the effects of the lower current USD gold price.  
     As one of the largest, undeveloped single-deposit gold projects in Australia, we believe Mt Todd is a highly strategic gold project with several potential paths to production. Our strong working capital position provides us flexibility and

the assurance that we can continue to fund further optimization studies at Mt Todd, and to select a development strategy that we believe will have the best potential to maximize value for our shareholders.
     Vista Gold Corp. was originally incorporated on November 28, 1983 under the name “Granges Exploration Ltd.” It amalgamated with Pecos Resources Ltd. during June 1985 and continued as Granges Exploration Ltd.

 Geographic and Segment Information
     We have one reportable segment, consisting of evaluation, acquisition and exploration activities which are focused principally in Australia.  We evaluate, acquire, explore and advance gold exploration and potential development projects, which may lead to gold production or value adding strategic transactions.   We reported no operating revenues during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Geographic location of mineral properties and plant and equipment is provided in Notes 4 – Mineral Properties and 5 – Plant and Equipment to our Consolidated Financial Statements under the section heading “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” below.     Reclamation
     We generally will be required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping and re-vegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing operations are completed. These reclamation efforts would be conducted in accordance with detailed plans, which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies.
     The Mt Todd site was not reclaimed when the mine closed in the late 1990’s.  Liability for the reclamation of the environmental conditions existing prior to Vista’s involvement with the project remains the responsibility of the NT Government until 30 days after we have provided notice to the NT Government that we intend to take over and assume the management, operation and rehabilitation of Mt Todd.  Vista will not give such notice until a production decision has been made, the project is fully permitted to construct the mine, and the necessary financing for construction has been arranged.  
     The Province of British Columbia Ministry of Energy and Mines (“MEM”) has requested that the Company prepare and present to MEM a reclamation plan for closure and abandonment of certain mining claims in British Columbia which the Company had disposed of in 1996.  Assuming no other potentially responsible parties are identified and based on preliminary estimates of the reclamation costs, we have accrued $350. It is possible that this estimate may change.
     Government Regulation
     Our exploration and development activities and other property interests are subject to various national, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in the United States, Mexico, Australia, and other jurisdictions, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. We have obtained or have pending applications for those licenses, permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct our exploration and other programs. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining, health, safety and environmental statutes and regulations in all of the jurisdictions in which we operate. With the exception of the British Columbia claims noted above, management of the Company is not aware of any current orders or directions relating to us with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations.      Australia Laws 
     Mineral projects in the Northern Territory are subject to Australian federal and Northern Territory laws and regulations regarding environmental matters and the discharge of hazardous wastes and materials. As with all mining projects, Mt Todd would be expected to have a variety of environmental impacts should development proceed. We are required under Australian laws and regulations (federal, state and territorial) to acquire permits and other authorizations before Mt Todd can be developed and mined. In Australia, environmental legislation plays a significant role in the mining industry. Various environmental documents, such as the Mt Todd EIS, covering studies on inter alia, air, water, pollution, hazardous and toxic wastes, reclamation of mining area, etc., are required by the Northern Territory Minister for Mines & Energy and Environment and the Australian Government Minister For Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities for approval.  During September 2014, the EIS for Mt Todd was approved.  The Environmental Protection Agency of the Northern Territory Government (“NTEPA”) advised that it had assessed the environmental impacts of the Mt Todd gold mine and concluded that Mt Todd can proceed, subject to a number of recommendations which are outlined in the assessment report, particularly, a request for authorization under the federal Environmental

Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (“EPBC”) as it relates to the Gouldian Finch. We must comply with the terms of our Authority Certificate under the Northern Territory Aboriginal Sacred Sites Act 1989 which deals with the handling of archeological material within sacred sites. We are also subject to statutory requirements under the Mining Management Act, which includes the requirement to complete a Mine Management Plan (“MMP”) before the start of mining operations. Preparation of the Mt Todd MMP is in progress.
     Environmental Regulation
     Our projects are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws are continually changing and, in general, are becoming more restrictive. Our policy is to conduct business in a way that safeguards public health and the environment. We believe that our operations are conducted in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
     Changes to current local, state or federal laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate could require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and/or reclamation costs. We are unable to predict what additional legislation, if any, might be proposed or enacted, or what additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of our projects.
     During 2016, none of our project sites had any material non-compliance occurrences with any applicable environmental regulations.         Competition
     We compete with other mining companies in connection with the acquisition, exploration, financing and development of gold properties. There is competition for the limited number of gold acquisition and exploration opportunities, some of which is with other companies having substantially greater financial resources than we have. As a result, we may have difficulty acquiring attractive gold projects at reasonable prices. We use consultants and compete with other mining companies for the man hours of consulting time required to complete our studies.  We also compete with other mining companies for mining engineers, geologists and other skilled personnel in the mining industry and for exploration and development services.
     Gold Price History
     The price of gold is volatile and is affected by numerous factors, all of which are beyond our control, such as the sale or purchase of gold by various central banks and financial institutions, inflation, recession, fluctuation in the relative values of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, changes in global gold demand and political and economic conditions.
     The following table presents the high, low and average afternoon fixed prices in U.S. dollars for an ounce of gold on the London Bullion Market over the past five years:
    
Year | High | | Low | | Average
2012 | $ | 1,792 | | $ | 1,540 | $ | 1,669
2013 | | 1,694 | | | 1,192 | | 1,411
2014 | | 1,385 | | | 1,142 | | 1,266
2015 | | 1,296 | | | 1,049 | | 1,160
2016 | | 1,366 | | | 1,077 | | 1,251
