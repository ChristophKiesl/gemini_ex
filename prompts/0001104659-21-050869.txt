Item 1. Business.
Introduction
 
MCAC was formed as a blank check company on November 12, 2019, under the laws of the state of Delaware, for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. Based on its business activities, MCAC was a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act because it had no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash. Until the consummation of the Business Combination (as defined below), the Company did not engage in any operations nor generated any revenue.
 
On June 9, 2020, MCAC consummated its initial public offering (the “initial public offering” or “IPO”) of 5,000,000 units, each consisting of one share of MCAC common stock and one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of a MCAC share of common stock (the “Units”), generating gross proceeds of $50,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of our IPO, MCAC consummated the sale of 321,500 Units in a private placement (the “Private Units”) to Sunlight Global Investment LLC (“Sponsor”) and Chardan Capital Markets, LLC (“Chardan”), generating gross proceeds of $3,215,000. On June 17, 2020, Chardan exercised its over-allotment option in part and sold an additional 749,800 MCAC Units at an offering price of $10.00 per MCAC Unit, generating additional gross proceeds of $7,498,000. In connection with the underwriters’ partial exercise of their over-allotment option, our Sponsor and Chardan purchased from us an additional 33,741 Private Units for a total purchase price of $330,741, of which 29,992 Private Units was purchased by our Sponsor and 3,749 Private Units was purchased by Chardan.
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO and the exercise of the over-allotment option by Chardan, MCAC also sold the Unit Purchase Option (the “UPO”) to purchase up to 344,988 units to Chardan, for a purchase price of $100. The UPO is exercisable at $11.50 per unit (for an aggregate exercise price of $3,967,362), beginning on the consummation of our initial business combination. The UPO may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder’s option, and expires on June 9, 2025.
 
After deducting the underwriting discounts, offering expenses, and commissions from the IPO and the sale of the Private Units, a total of $58,647,960 was deposited into a trust account (the “Trust Account”), and the remaining $432,822 of the net proceeds were outside of the Trust Account and made available to be used for business, legal and accounting due diligence on prospective business combinations and continuing general and administrative expenses. In accordance with MCAC’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the amounts held in the Trust Account could only be used by the Company upon the consummation of a business combination, except that there could be released to MCAC, from time to time, any interest earned on the funds in the Trust Account that it may need to pay its tax obligations.
 
On February 10, 2021, the Company consummated the Business Combination (as defined below), pursuant to which the Company acquired Playboy Enterprises, Inc. (“Playboy”) (the acquisition is referred to herein as the “Business Combination”). In connection with the closing of the Business Combination (the “Closing”), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) dated September 30, 2020, between the Company, MCAC Merger Sub Inc. (“Merger Sub”), Playboy and Suying Liu, Merger Sub merged with and into Playboy, with Playboy surviving the merger as a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and in connection therewith the Company changed its name from Mountain Crest Acquisition Corp to PLBY Group, Inc. (the “Merger”).
 
In connection with the Business Combination, MCAC entered into subscription agreements, each dated as of September 30, 2020 (the “Subscription Agreements”), with certain institutional and accredited investors (collectively, the “PIPE Investors”), pursuant to which MCAC issued and sold to the PIPE Investors, in a private placement closed immediately prior to the closing of the Business Combination, 5,000,000 shares of common stock (the “PIPE Shares”) at $10.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $50,000,000 (the “PIPE”) to be used by the Company following the consummation of the Business Combination.
 
At the Closing and pursuant to the Merger Agreement, MCAC (i) issued an aggregate of 20,916,812 shares of common stock to existing stockholders of Playboy, (ii) assumed Playboy options exercisable for an aggregate of 3,560,541 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $5.61 and (iii) assumed the obligation to issue shares in respect of terminated Playboy restricted stock units for an aggregate of 2,045,634 shares of common stock to be settled approximately one year following the Closing.
 
Upon the consummation of the Business Combination, Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC and Roth Capital Partners LLC each received 100,000 shares of common stock (the “Advisory Shares”) as compensation for advisory services rendered to MCAC, including in their role as placement agents in the PIPE investment pursuant to an agreement, dated July 22, 2020, which was subsequently amended to join Roth Capital Partners, LLC on September 30, 2020. The services were completed as of September 30, 2020.
