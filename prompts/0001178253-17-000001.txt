ITEM 1.     BUSINESS
Overview
SCYNEXIS is a drug development company committed to the development and commercialization of novel anti-infectives to address significant unmet therapeutic needs. We are developing our lead product candidate, SCY-078, as a novel oral and intravenous (IV) drug for the treatment of several fungal infections, including serious and life-threatening invasive fungal infections. SCY-078 is a novel and structurally distinct triterpenoid glucan synthase inhibitor that has been shown to be effective in vitro and in vivo against a broad range of Candida and Aspergillus species, including drug-resistant strains. Candida and Aspergillus species are the fungi responsible for approximately 85% of all invasive fungal infections in the United States (U.S.) and Europe. To date, we have characterized the pharmacokinetics and safety profile of the oral and intravenous formulations of SCY-078 in multiple Phase 1 studies. In a Phase 2 study, evaluating oral SCY-078 as a step-down therapy in patients with invasive candidiasis, we confirmed that oral SCY-078 achieved the intended plasma exposure for efficacy and was well-tolerated. In another Phase 2 study, evaluating oral SCY-078 in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), we observed numerically higher clinical cure rates at test-of-cure and fewer recurrences of VVC at the four-month follow-up when compared to the standard of care (oral fluconazole). On March 2, 2017, the FDA informed us to hold the initiation of any new clinical studies with the IV formulation of SCY-078. Ongoing and future clinical development using the oral formulation of SCY-078 are unaffected by this regulatory action. We are working closely with the FDA to review the pre-clinical and clinical data supporting the use of a suitable IV formulation and dose regimen of SCY-078 to test in subsequent studies. The upcoming meeting with the FDA is scheduled for the second quarter of 2017. 
SCY-078 holds both Fast Track and Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) designations for the IV and oral formulations for the indications of invasive candidiasis (including candidemia) and invasive aspergillosis. SCY-078 also holds Orphan Drug designation for both indications. These designations are designed to facilitate the development of and expedite review of drugs by allowing companies to interact with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review team frequently. Additionally, the orphan drug designation of SCY-078 provides seven years of market exclusivity in the U.S. following FDA approval, which in conjunction with the granted QIDP designation (which provides an additional five years of exclusivity) provides SCYNEXIS with a potential 12 years of market exclusivity upon FDA approval of SCY-078. 
We are currently focusing our resources on the development of SCY-078. In the future, we may develop other assets within our proprietary antifungal platform or through collaborations with strategic development partners. Additionally, we may assess external opportunities and identify strategic collaborations to expand our clinical pipeline. 
As a spinout from Aventis S.A., or Aventis in 2000, we began as a chemistry and animal health services company, providing contract research services to third parties. This contract research and development services business, which we refer to as our “Services Business,” generated substantially all of our revenue until we completed the sale of the Services Business to Accuratus Lab Services, Inc., or Accuratus, in July 2015.

Our Strategy
Key elements of our strategy include:

• | to further develop SCY-078 and obtain regulatory approval in major commercial markets for our three key indications: invasive candidiasis, complicated and recurrent VVC and invasive aspergillosis;


• | to commercialize SCY-078 for selected indications in the U.S. through a dedicated commercial team, including field force;


• | to contract with commercial partners to develop and commercialize SCY-078 outside of the U.S.;


• | to assess external opportunities to expand our clinical pipeline; and


• | to leverage our strong scientific team to pursue the development of other internal proprietary compounds.

Market Opportunity
The global antifungal market accounted for $10.7 billion in 2015 with the systemic antifungal drugs reaching $800 million in the U.S. We estimate that, each year, there are over 600,000 cases of invasive fungal infections caused by various species of Candida and Aspergillus, the two most common invasive fungal pathogens, globally. The estimated incidence in the U.S. for these conditions is approximately 98,000 and 46,000 for invasive candidiasis and invasive aspergillosis, respectively. The rapid progression of disease and high mortality rates (20% - 50%) associated with documented invasive fungal infections often result in antifungal therapy being administered in suspected (unconfirmed) cases or as a preventative measure in patients at high risk. Also, the increasingly widespread use of immune suppressive drugs as cancer chemotherapy or for organ transplantation or treatment of autoimmune disease has resulted in an increasing population of patients at risk for invasive fungal infections. Furthermore, the limited number of systemic antifungal drug classes, consisting of azoles, echinocandins and polyenes, and their extensive use, has led to increased numbers of infections with drug-resistant strains. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has listed fluconazole-resistant Candida as a serious threat requiring prompt and sustained action and has also identified a rise in echinocandin resistance, especially among Candida glabrata. In June 2016, the CDC issued an extraordinary alert for healthcare facilities and providers to be on the lookout for patients with Candida auris, a multidrug resistant strain with high mortality (approximately 60%). Almost half of C. auris isolates are multidrug resistant to two or more antifungal classes (large majority resistant to fluconazole, 40% resistant to echinocandins), stressing the urgent need for new antifungal agents with activity against resistant strains. 
Invasive Candidiasis is a serious fungal infection that occurs in immunocompromised patients. Current treatment guidelines in the U.S. and in Europe recommend the use of echinocandins (the only glucan synthase inhibitor currently commercially available) as the initial first-line therapy for invasive candidiasis. The main limitation of the echinocandin class is that only IV administration is available, limiting the flexibility of stepping down to an oral therapy in the same treatment class. The ability to step down to an oral therapy is important because it allows patients to be discharged from the hospital, as IV administration generally must occur in the hospital. The only option currently available to step down to an oral therapy after initial IV echinocandin are the azoles (the only class orally bioavailable), which have reported an increased frequency of resistant isolates, and are associated with increased risk of drug-drug interactions and toxicities, thus creating a gap in optimal treatment options for patients that could benefit from an orally administered effective antifungal agent. 
VVC, commonly known as a "vaginal yeast infection," is usually caused by Candida spp. The estimated annual incidence in the U.S. for VVC is approximately six million cases and approximately 20% of the cases are considered complicated and among the most difficult to treat. Complicated VVC includes recurrent, severe, non-albicans candidiasis, and women with diabetes, immunocompromising conditions, debilitation or immunosuppressive therapy (i.e., corticosteroids). Historically, 85% - 95% of cultured yeast species were C. albicans. However, due to a variety of interventions, including single dose treatment, low-dosage azole maintenance regimens, and the use of over-the-counter antimycotics, the proportion of non-albicans Candida (NAC) species appears to be increasing. Reports published in the most recent decade suggest a NAC prevalence of 10% - 30% in patients with VVC. The predominant NAC species cited in these studies, C. glabrata, as well as other strains including C. krusei, do not reliably respond to azoles. Current treatments for acute VVC include over-the-counter topical azole antifungals (clotrimazole, miconazole, and others) and the use of the prescription oral azole antifungal, fluconazole. Fluconazole is the only orally administered antifungal currently approved for acute VVC in the U.S., with a therapeutic cure rate of 55% as reported in its label. There are no oral alternatives for VVC patients who do not respond to or tolerate fluconazole and there are no products currently approved for the treatment of recurrent VVC.
Invasive Aspergillosis is a serious fungal infection that occurs in immunocompromised patients. Current treatment guidelines in the U.S. and in Europe recommend the use of azoles (itraconazole, voriconazole or isavuconazole) as the initial first-line therapy for invasive aspergillosis. The main limitation of the azole class is that it is associated with increased risk of drug-drug interactions and toxicities, thus creating a gap in optimal treatment options for patients that could benefit from an 
 5

orally administered safe and effective antifungal agent. The sub-optimal toxicity profile of the azoles has a greater impact for invasive aspergillosis patients given that they typically receive antifungal therapy for long durations (up to four months). 
SCY-078, a triterpenoid analogue, represents a new chemical class which acts through the inhibition of the glucan synthase, an established target in antifungal therapeutics. SCY-078 is being developed as oral and IV formulations and has demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a large collection of medically relevant strains of Candida and Aspergillus, including multi-drug resistant strains that have been isolated from infected patients. Specifically, SCY-078 has shown in vitro activity against multi-drug resistant organism such as C. auris. SCY-078 has unique attributes that define its potential to address significant unmet medical needs and market opportunities, including:

• | broad activity against Candida and Aspergillus strains;


• | activity against azole and most echinocandin-resistant Candida strains, including multi-drug resistant strains;


• | activity against azole-resistant Aspergillus strains;


• | only glucan synthase inhibitor with both oral and IV formulations in clinical development, allowing first-line treatment and oral step down with the same agent;


• | distinct chemical structure from other glucan synthase inhibitors, providing a unique spectrum of activity and pharmacokinetic profile;


• | fungicidal (i.e., killing the fungi) capabilities against Candida species compared to azoles, which are fungistatic (i.e., inhibiting the growth of fungi); and


• | high tissue penetration, allowing high concentrations in the organs commonly affected by fungal infections.

Based on SCY-078’s unique attributes and limitations of current approved therapies, we believe, if approved, our product can initially address therapeutic needs in three primary indications:

• | invasive candidiasis;


• | complicated and recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis; and


• | invasive aspergillosis.

In the future we may also consider other indications for SCY-078 for which longer oral antifungal regimens are typically needed and would benefit from the broad spectrum of activity, favorable safety profile and low potential for drug-drug interactions, including for the treatment of chronic fungal infections and for prophylaxis use.
If approved for the indications of invasive candidiasis and invasive aspergillosis, we intend to market SCY-078 to hospitals and major medical centers, where critical care physicians, infectious disease specialists, and physicians treating immune-compromised patients, such as oncologists and those performing solid organ transplants and stem cell transplants, are likely to be found and where invasive fungal infections are more prevalent. If approved for the indication of vulvovaginal candidiasis, we intend to market SCY-078 to physicians specializing in women's health.
SCY-078 Development
We initially discovered and developed SCY-078 through a research collaboration with Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., or Merck, a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., and in May 2013 we acquired worldwide rights to SCY-078 in the field of human health. The compound is derived, by chemical modification, from enfumafungin, a natural product, and shows antifungal activity against Candida and Aspergillus through inhibition of glucan synthesis, a similar mechanism of action to the echinocandin class. SCY-078 has shown fungicidal activity against clinically relevant Candida species and potent in vitro activity against strains of Candida that are resistant to azoles and echinocandins and azole-resistant Aspergillus species. We recently reported potent antifungal in vitro activity of SCY-078 against the multidrug resistant pathogen Candida auris, which has been classified by the CDC as an emerging serious global health threat. SCY-078 is the first representative of new class of antifungal agents, triterpenoid analogue (a novel and structurally distinct glucan synthase inhibitor), that retains antifungal activity against the majority of echinocandin-resistant strains, suggesting that SCY-078 acts on the fungal cell wall in a manner distinct from the echinocandins.
We are developing both IV and oral formulations of SCY-078. Patients with invasive fungal infections are typically prescribed IV treatment in hospitals and then are switched, or “stepped down,” to oral formulations to complete their antifungal treatment after they have shown sufficient improvement. The duration of the entire antifungal regimen (IV and oral) varies depending on the response to the antifungal treatment and the type of infection. Per current guidelines, invasive candidiasis patients are treated for at least two weeks after negative cultures are obtained and invasive aspergillosis patients are typically treated for six to 12 weeks. The availability of SCY-078 in both oral and IV formulations would allow for maximum flexibility in the administration of the same agent during the entire antifungal regimen. The IV formulation would allow initiation of 
 6

treatment in critically ill patients for whom IV therapy is preferred. The oral formulation would allow step-down from the initial IV antifungal agent (either SCY-078 or echinocandins) to complete the antifungal regimen, as well as initiation of therapy in outpatient settings for those conditions that do not require hospitalization, such as VVC.
In animal models of invasive fungal infections used to test other drugs that have proven to be effective in humans, SCY-078 was shown to be highly active against Candida spp. These studies determined the drug concentrations in blood required to achieve efficacy. These correlations of drug exposure to drug activity, or PK/PD, have been used to identify the predicted human exposure of SCY-078 believed to be required to achieve efficacy (i.e., target exposure). Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies of SCY-078 indicate that the target exposure is achievable in humans at doses and regimens expected to be safe and adequately tolerated.
To date, more than 300 subjects and patients have received SCY-078 either orally, by IV, or by IV followed by oral. The most commonly reported adverse events after oral administration have been gastrointestinal events (i.e., nausea, diarrhea, vomiting). The gastrointestinal (GI) events reported have typically been transient (i.e., short duration), mild or moderate and not leading to discontinuation. The most commonly reported adverse events after IV administration of SCY-078 have been local reactions at the site of infusion. During an extension of our Phase 1 IV program in healthy volunteers, aimed to expand the safety margin that would allow greater flexibility of dosing options in patients, we observed three mild-to-moderate thrombotic events in healthy volunteers receiving the IV formulation of SCY-078 at the highest doses and highest concentrations in a Phase 1 study. These events were reported to FDA as 15-day alert reports because they were unexpected and required anticoagulant therapy. The potential contribution of the IV formulation of SCY-078 to these events cannot be ruled out even though rates of thrombotic events due to intravenous catheters reported in the literature are comparable to those observed in the Phase 1 study. 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) are common when conducting clinical trials in a seriously ill population such as patients experiencing invasive candidiasis. Several SAEs have been reported in our clinical trials but only four of the events have been deemed by the investigator to be potentially related to SCY-078, although other contributing factors could not be ruled out. These four SAEs include: one event of elevation of liver function tests in a subject who received a single dose of oral SCY-078 (resolved) and three recent mild-to-moderate events secondary to thrombi formation at site of IV infusion (resolved or progressing towards resolution). 
In 2016, we reported results from two Phase 1 drug-drug interaction studies confirming the low potential for drug interaction of SCY-078; results from the Phase 1 IV SCY-078 program confirming the IV doses and regimens needed to achieve target exposure; and results from two Phase 2 studies with the oral formulation of SCY-078. The first Phase 2 study confirmed the achievement of plasma target exposures of SCY-078 and adequate tolerability after oral administration of SCY-078 in patients with invasive candidiasis, and the second study indicated high clinical cure rates in patients with vulvovaginal Candida infection (VVC), providing further confirmation of the antifungal activity of SCY-078 against Candida spp. Additionally, the SCY-078 toxicology program was expanded to include three-month oral dose studies in two species (rats and dogs). Consistent with findings from prior non-clinical toxicology studies of shorter durations, these longer-term toxicity studies confirmed the favorable safety profile of oral SCY-078.  These results would allow flexible treatment regimens of SCY-078 for up to three months in our next stages of clinical development, which is particularly relevant for patients with invasive aspergillosis or refractory fungal infections.
SCY-078 is protected by an issued composition of matter patent in the United States, which expires in 2030. The composition of matter patent has been granted in 53 countries and is pending in 23 other countries. An additional patent application related to SCY-078 salts and polymorphs has been filed and is currently pending. If granted, the new patent family will extend the patent protection of SCY-078 salts, including the citrate salt currently under development, up to 2036.
We have licensed rights to develop and commercialize SCY-078 in the field of human health in Russia and certain smaller non-core markets to R-Pharm, CJSC, or R-Pharm, a leading supplier of hospital drugs in Russia, in exchange for an upfront payment, royalties, and their expertise and financial assistance in developing the compound, as more completely described under the heading “Collaborations and Licensing Agreements” as set forth below.
SCY-078 Target Product Profile
We believe that there are significant commercial opportunities for a novel IV/oral antifungal agent that has potent activity against a broad-spectrum of Candida and Aspergillus species, including azole-resistant and most echinocandin-resistant strains and that has a favorable safety and tolerability profile. If approved, SCY-078 has the potential to address significant gaps with commercially available therapies and could be used as follows:
Treatment of invasive Candida infections. If SCY-078 is approved for the treatment of invasive Candida infections, we believe it could complement or replace echinocandins as the drug of choice for these infections because of its broader spectrum of activity and its availability in both IV and oral forms. Having both formulations would allow physicians and their patients to start and stay on a single effective therapy for the inpatient and outpatient settings. Transitioning patients from 
 7

hospital-based care to outpatient care is key to potentially reduce, or eliminate, expensive hospital stays and risks of hospital-acquired infections. Additionally, SCY-078 could also be used as the step-down therapy from any echinocandin, replacing fluconazole, and providing the advantage of continuing the antifungal treatment with an oral glucan synthase inhibitor that has a broader spectrum of activity than fluconazole.
Treatment of infections due to drug-resistant Candida. SCY-078 has been shown to be effective pre-clinically against Candida species resistant to azoles, including C. auris, C. albicans, C. glabrata and C. krusei. In addition, SCY-078 has been shown to be effective in vitro against the majority of echinocandin-resistant Candida strains tested. If approved, SCY-078 has the potential to provide a first-line treatment against invasive Candida infections, including those known or suspected to be resistant to currently available azoles and echinocandins.
Treatment of invasive Aspergillus infections. If SCY-078 is approved for the treatment of invasive Aspergillus infections, we believe it could complement and/or offer significant advantages over the current first-line azole therapy of mold active azoles (e.g., voriconazole, isavuconazole) due to the numerous drug-drug interactions and adverse events associated with the use of these drugs. Furthermore, SCY-078 has been shown to be effective in vitro against all azole-resistant strains of Aspergillus tested. If approved, SCY-078 could provide a first-line treatment against invasive Aspergillus infections known to be resistant to currently available azoles.
Treatment of VVC. If SCY-078 is approved for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis, it could provide a first-line therapy for recurrent VVC, for which there is currently no treatment, and be the only oral, non-azole, fungicidal treatment for complicated and recurrent cases of VVC. Fluconazole administered for up to six months is recommended for recurrent VVC, but recurrences are observed rapidly after stopping fluconazole due to the persistence of the fungi in the vaginal reservoir. In contrast with fluconazole that is fungistatic against Candida spp., SCY-078 is fungicidal against most Candida isolates. We believe this “cidal” activity (i.e., killing the pathogen) may provide an advantage in preventing recurrences. SCY-078, with its activity against azole-resistance strains, may also be adequate to treat VVC episodes caused by azole-resistant isolates or complicated VVC for which fluconazole does not provide optimal outcomes. 
Prevention of Candida and Aspergillus infections. If SCY-078 is approved for use as a preventative treatment for Candida and Aspergillus infections, it has the potential to offer advantages over current prophylactic drugs because of its favorable safety and tolerability profile, low drug-drug interaction potential and its activity against fungal strains that are resistant to azoles.
In the future, given SCY-078’s unique attributes and limitations of current approved therapies, we may also consider other indications for which longer oral antifungal regimens are typically needed (e.g., chronic fungal infections).
Preclinical Characterization of SCY-078 
SCY-078 has broad antifungal activity based on a proven mechanism of action
SCY-078 is a potent inhibitor of the synthesis of the polymer beta (1,3)-D-glucan, an essential component of the fungal cell walls of Candida and Aspergillus species. Glucan synthesis inhibition is a clinically proven antifungal mechanism of action, as demonstrated by the echinocandin class of antifungal agents. The activity of SCY-078 observed against the majority of echinocandin-resistant strains suggests that SCY-078 acts in a manner distinct from the echinocandins. SCY-078 has been shown to have potent activity in vitro against clinically relevant Candida and Aspergillus species, including isolates that are resistant to currently available antifungal therapies. Azole-resistance among Candida and Aspergillus species is a global concern, particularly considering that Azoles are the only antifungal class used to treat these life-threatening conditions that can be administered orally. SCY-078 retains its antifungal potency against fungal strains that are resistant to azoles. Echinocandin resistance is increasing in prevalence, particularly among azole-resistant species such as Candida glabrata. SCY-078 retained in vitro activity against a majority of echinocandin-resistant Candida glabrata strains we have tested. Multidrug resistance has been reported in several strains of Candida; particularly concerning is the emergence of C.auris that exhibits high rates of resistance to two or more antifungals. Thus, SCY-078 may offer a therapeutic option against multidrug resistant strains such as those that have emerged in Candida glabrata and Candida auris.
Nonclinical toxicology is supportive of continued development 
The preclinical safety of SCY-078 has been evaluated in multiple studies in rats, dogs, rabbits, and non-human primates. The SCY-078 toxicology program was recently expanded to include three-month oral dose studies and one-month IV dose studies in two species (rats and dogs). Consistent with findings from prior non-clinical toxicology studies of shorter durations, we believe that these longer-term toxicity studies confirmed the favorable safety profile of oral SCY-078.  These results would allow flexible treatment regimens of SCY-078 for up to three months in our next stages of clinical development, which is particularly relevant for patients with invasive aspergillosis or refractory fungal infections.

Clinical Experience with SCY-078
To date, the oral formulations of SCY-078 have been evaluated in more than 300 subjects and patients from multiple Phase 1 studies and two Phase 2 studies, and the IV formulations of SCY-078 have been evaluated in more than 70 subjects in four Phase 1 studies. 
SCY-078 has been generally well-tolerated following single, oral doses up to 1600 mg and multiple doses up to 800 mg/day for 28 consecutive days in Phase 1 studies. The SCY-078 half-life of approximately 20 hours supports once-daily dosing and a loading dose on day 1 should result in rapid achievement of therapeutic concentrations. The most commonly reported adverse events after oral administration have been gastrointestinal events (i.e., nausea, diarrhea, vomiting). The gastrointestinal (GI) events reported have typically been transient (i.e., short duration), mild or moderate and not leading to discontinuation. The most commonly reported adverse events after IV administration of SCY-078 have been local reactions at the site of infusion. During an extension of our Phase 1 IV program in healthy volunteers, aimed to expand the safety margin that would allow greater flexibility of dosing options in patients, we observed three mild-to-moderate thrombotic events in healthy volunteers receiving the IV formulation of SCY-078 at the highest doses and highest concentrations in a Phase 1 study. These events were reported to FDA as 15-day alert reports because they were unexpected and required anticoagulant therapy. The potential contribution of the IV formulation of SCY-078 to these events cannot be ruled out even though rates of thrombotic events due to intravenous catheters reported in the literature are comparable to those observed in the Phase 1 study. On March 2, 2017, we announced that the FDA had informed us to hold the initiation of any new clinical studies with our IV formulation until the FDA completes a review of all available pre-clinical and clinical data of the IV formulation of SCY-078. 
In 2016, we completed a Phase 2 Study of oral SCY-078 as step-down therapy from IV echinocandin in patients with invasive candidiasis. This was a multicenter, randomized, open-label study in which, following three to ten days of IV echinocandin therapy, 22 patients were randomized to receive either SCY-078 500mg QD (daily) with a 1,000mg loading dose (7 patients), SCY-078 750mg QD with a 1,250mg loading dose (7 patients), or standard of care (8 patients) receiving either fluconazole 400mg QD with an 800mg loading dose or micafungin IV for up to 28 days. SCY-078 was well tolerated in this study with a rate of AEs typical of this population and comparable to fluconazole. The global response at end of therapy (assessment of efficacy), was comparable or better for SCY-078 treated subjects compared to the standard of care, although this study was too small to draw definitive conclusions in regards to efficacy. The population PK analysis from this study also indicated that the high dose of SCY-078 tested (750mg QD) is predicted to achieve the target exposure at steady state in the majority of the patients.
In 2016, we also completed a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study of oral SCY-078 in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). In this multicenter, randomized, active controlled, evaluator-blinded study, oral SCY-078 was compared to oral fluconazole in adult female patients with VVC. 96 patients with an acute moderate to severe, symptomatic episode of VVC were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either three daily doses or five daily doses of oral SCY-078 750mg QD with a 1,250mg loading dose or single dose of oral fluconazole, per its label. SCY-078 was generally well tolerated and the most common AEs were mild to moderate gastrointestinal (GI) events. The rate of GI events was higher in patients receiving SCY-078 when compared to fluconazole. Numerically higher clinical cure rate was observed with SCY-078 treatment when compared to fluconazole treatment (76% versus 65%). Moreover, during the four-month observation period, patients who received oral SCY-078 had a higher clinical cure rate (88%) at the end of the observation period, which was at the four-month visit, compared to patients who received fluconazole (65%; p=0.04). Patients who received SCY-078 had a lower recurrence rate (4%) versus fluconazole (15%). The high clinical cure rates observed in this study are supportive of clinically relevant antifungal activity of SCY-078 in this form of Candida infection. 
Lastly, in 2016, we expanded our drug-drug interaction (DDIs) evaluation clinical program. Patients with invasive fungal infections are typically immuno-compromised and are commonly treated for long periods of time with multiple concomitant drugs for their underlying conditions. The potential for DDIs in these patients results in labeling restrictions, as is the case for the azole class of antifungals, which is associated with a high degree of DDIs with many commonly prescribed drugs. Results from clinical studies conducted thus far to determine the potential for clinical drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with medications that are metabolized or are inhibitors of CYP enzymes, a key metabolic pathway for many drugs, have confirmed the low potential of SCY-078 to cause clinically meaningful interactions. To date, DDI studies of SCY-078 have been conducted with ketoconazole (strong inhibitor of CYP3A4), diltiazem (moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4), pantoprazole (a proton pump inhibitor), rosiglitazone (a CYP2C8 substrate) and tacrolimus (a CYP3A4 substrate commonly used in the intended population). Overall, we believe the results from these studies indicate a low potential for DDIs with medications commonly used by the patients for which SCY-078 is intended. 
Planned SCY-078 Clinical Development Activities
We anticipate that our initial NDA submission would seek approval for an indication for oral and IV formulations of SCY-078 for the treatment of invasive Candida infections (or invasive candidiasis). We expect additional Phase 3 and post-
 9

market studies, and supplemental NDAs, to expand the list of indications to initially include treatment of invasive Aspergillus infections, recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis and prevention of invasive fungal infections.
We plan to conduct the following clinical studies:
SCY-078 (IV and Oral) for the Treatment of Invasive Candida Infections. The next study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SCY-078 in patients with invasive Candida infections is planned to be a dose ranging Phase 2 study which will include both the IV and oral formulations of SCY-078. We expect it to be a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, active comparator study evaluating the safety and efficacy of SCY-078 compared to standard of care. The current standard of care, per the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), is the initiation of antifungal therapy with an echinocandin (IV) and step-down to oral fluconazole for completion of the antifungal regimen. We are working closely with the FDA to review the pre-clinical and clinical data supporting the use of the IV formulation and dose regimen of SCY-078. The final design and initiation of this study will be informed by the upcoming discussion with the FDA scheduled for the second quarter of 2017. There can be no assurance that the FDA will lift the clinical hold on the initiation of any new clinical studies with the IV formulation of SCY-078, agree with our trial design to permit us to commence this study, or will do so in a timely manner. Upon completion of the Phase 2 study, we plan to conduct a single pivotal Phase 3 study in patients with invasive Candida infections to support a NDA for this indication. 
SCY-078 for the Treatment of Invasive Fungal Infections that are Refractory to or Intolerant of standard Antifungal agents (FURI study).  We plan this study to evaluate SCY-078 in infections where there is unmet need and for which SCY-078 has the potential to show differentiation from available therapies for invasive fungal infections, including invasive candidiasis. This is an open-label study in which SCY-078 will be administered to patients bearing invasive fungal infections that are refractory to, or to patients that are intolerant of, standard therapy (azoles, echinocandins and/or polyenes). We have opened sites in the U.S. and we expect enrollment to commence in the first half of 2017 for patients receiving the oral administration of SCY-078. We plan to keep this open-label study open until SCY-078 becomes commercially available, enabling access to SCY-078 for patients that have failed other therapies and for which limited treatment options are available. It is possible that compelling data in this study could result in streamlined development to an initial NDA for a restricted indication.
Other Clinical Activities. We are encouraged by our existing in vitro and in vivo data indicating activity against a broad range of Aspergillus species. We are also encouraged by the clinical data from our recently completed trial in patients with Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (VVC). Subsequent activities for potential indications including VVC and Invasive Aspergillosis are under evaluation. 
We are planning additional non-clinical development activities to support our SCY-078 development program, including further characterization of the antifungal spectrum of activity and toxicology assessments to enable longer term treatment durations.
Commercialization, Marketing and Sales of SCY-078
Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities.
We expect that prescribing physicians for the treatment of invasive fungal infections will be located at major medical centers, where physicians specializing in critical care, infectious disease specialists, and physicians treating immune-compromised or immune-suppressed patients, such as oncologists and those performing solid organ transplants and stem cell transplants, are likely to be found.
For the indications of invasive fungal infections, we intend to form our own focused hospital-based field force to target physicians in the United States. Outside of the United States, subject to obtaining necessary marketing approvals, we likely will seek to commercialize SCY-078 through distribution or other collaboration arrangements. We have already entered into an agreement pursuant to which we licensed to R-Pharm rights to develop and commercialize SCY-078 in the field of human health in Russia and certain smaller non-core markets.
For the VVC indication, we anticipate that prescribing physicians will mostly be obstetricians and gynecologists and likely a number of primary care physicians and, we believe, it will require a specific sales and marketing force with a women's health focus. We will assess our global commercial strategy for VVC in the future.
Competition for SCY-078
Our competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies. The three leading branded antifungal drugs representing one from each main class are as follows:
Azoles. V-fend® (voriconazole), a product marketed by Pfizer (peak worldwide sales of $685 million). Merck also markets the azole Noxafil® (posaconazole) and Astellas has the marketing rights to Cresemba® (isavuconazole), recently approved in the U.S. and other global markets;
 10

Echinocandins. Cancidas® (caspofungin), a product marketed by Merck (peak worldwide sales of $530 million). Pfizer also markets the echinocandin Eraxis® (anidulafungin) and Astellas markets the echinocandin Mycamine® (micafungin); and
Polyenes. AmBisome® (liposomal amphotericin B), a product sold by Gilead in Europe, by Astellas in the U.S. and by Dainippon-Sumitomo in Japan (peak worldwide sales of $379 million).
Pfizer, Merck and Astellas are all large pharmaceutical companies with significant experience and financial resources in the marketing and sale of specialty pharmaceuticals. Various other producers market and sell generic oral voriconazole, fluconazole and itraconazole.
Further, we expect that product candidates currently in clinical development may represent significant competition, if approved. These include the triazole VT-1161 being developed by Viamet Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the long-acting IV echinocandin CD101 being developed by Cidara Therapeutics, Inc., the polyene amphotericin B oral formulation MAT2203 developed by Matinas BioPharma Holdings Inc., APX-001 developed by Amplyx Pharmaceuticals Inc., and F901318 developed by F2G Limited. These companies may have greater resources than ours. 
We believe that SCY-078 has the ability to perform well in the future fungal infection market given the sparse competitive marketplace, the unmet medical need, and the high mortality rate. The key competitive factors affecting the success of SCY-078, if approved, are likely to be its efficacy, safety, convenience, price, use in outpatient settings, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. If approved, we believe that SCY-078’s unique features, including being a novel class antifungal, broad-spectrum of activity including resistant strains, IV and oral formulations, and favorable safety profile, will differentiate it from competing products and allow premium pricing to generics and other competing products.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA, or other regulatory, approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected because in many cases insurers or other third-party payors seek to encourage the use of generic products. In the azole class, fluconazole, itraconazole, and oral voriconazole are generic. There is currently no generic echinocandin, but caspofungin, the largest selling echinocandin, is expected to become available on a generic basis in 2017 and most likely prior to the launch of SCY-078. If approved, we believe SCY-078 will be capable of delivering value supportive of premium pricing over competitive generic products.
Manufacturing and Supply of SCY-078
We have agreements with external vendors that are capable of supplying kilogram quantities of drug substance and of producing drug product to support ongoing and planned clinical trials. However, we do not own or operate and do not intend to own or operate facilities for manufacturing, storage and distribution, or testing of drug substance or drug product. We have relied on third-party contract manufacturers for synthesis of our clinical compounds and manufacture of drug product. We expect to continue to rely on either existing or alternative third-party manufacturers to supply SCY-078 for ongoing and planned clinical trials and for commercial production.
SCY-078 is a semi-synthetic compound. Thus, the manufacturing process for SCY-078 involves fermentation and synthetic chemical steps. The overall process does not require any specialized equipment and uses readily sourced intermediates. At commercial launch, we expect cost of goods for SCY-078 to be similar to that of other small molecule drugs. We have negotiated agreements with suppliers to produce both drug product and drug substance for our current needs. In the future, we plan to validate the process with selected vendors and secondary suppliers to establish a secure supply chain that could enable commercialization.
We estimate our supplies on hand for both oral and IV formulations of SCY-078 are sufficient to supply our ongoing and planned clinical trials. Manufacture of additional supplies of SCY-078 drug substance is planned to support any further optimization of either of the formulations, if needed. Additional batches of both oral and IV SCY-078 drug product will be manufactured as needed to support the subsequent stages of our clinical development plan.
A drug manufacturing program subject to extensive governmental regulations requires robust quality assurance systems and experienced personnel with the relevant technical and regulatory expertise as well as strong project management skills. We believe we have a team that is capable of managing these activities. The third-party vendors that currently manufacture clinical supplies to support our ongoing clinical studies have the necessary capabilities and are in compliance with cGMP appropriate for the current stage of development.
The third-party vendors we will select to support our manufacturing and supply program both for future late-stage development and commercial readiness activities will have the required capabilities with respect to facilities, equipment and technical expertise, quality systems that meet global regulatory and compliance requirements, satisfactory regulatory inspection 
 11

history from relevant health authorities and proven track records in supplying drug substance and drug product for late-stage clinical and commercial use.
Research and Development Expenses
A significant portion of our operating expenses is related to research and development and we intend to maintain our strong commitment to research and development. In fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 we incurred $20.1 million, $16.4 million and $8.3 million, respectively, on research and development expenses. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for costs and expenses related to research and development, and other financial information for each of the fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014.
Collaborations and Licensing Agreements Associated with Our Core Drug Development Operations
We currently have a number of licensing and collaboration agreements associated with our core drug development operations, including the following:
Merck
We initially discovered and developed SCY-078 through a research collaboration with Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., or "Merck", a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc. In May 2013, Merck transferred to us all development and commercialization rights for SCY-078 (also known as MK-3118). This decision was made following a review and prioritization of Merck’s infectious disease portfolio. Under the terms of the agreement, we received all human health rights to SCY-078, including all related technical documents, preclinical data, data from the seven Phase 1 trials conducted by Merck, and drug product and drug substance.  The agreement continues until expiration of all royalty obligations. The agreement may be terminated if either party is in material breach and fails to remedy the breach after receiving written notice. In January 2014, Merck assigned the patents to us related to SCY-078 that it had exclusively licensed to us. Under the terms of the patent assignment, Merck no longer has responsibility to maintain the patents. Merck is eligible to receive milestones upon initiation of a Phase 3 clinical study, NDA filing and marketing approvals in each of the U.S., major European markets and Japan that could total up to $19 million. In addition, Merck will receive tiered royalties based on worldwide sales of SCY-078. The aggregate royalties are in the single digit percentages of net sales, and we expect to pay royalties on net sales of SCY-078 to Merck for no more than ten years from first commercial launch, on a country-by-country basis.
In December 2014, we entered into an amendment to the license agreement with Merck that defers the remittance of a milestone payment due to Merck, such that no amount will be due upon initiation of the first phase 2 clinical trial of a product containing the SCY-078 compound (the "Deferred Milestone"). The amendment also increased, in an amount equal to the Deferred Milestone, the milestone payment that will be due upon initiation of the first Phase 3 clinical trial of a product containing the SCY-078 compound. In December 2016, we entered into a second amendment to the license agreement with Merck which clarified what would constitute the initiation of a Phase 3 clinical trial for the purpose of a milestone payment. Except as described above, all other terms and provisions of the license agreement remain in full force and effect. 
R-Pharm
In August 2013, we entered into an agreement with R-Pharm, CJSC, or "R-Pharm", a leading supplier of hospital drugs in Russia, granting them exclusive rights to develop and commercialize SCY-078 in the field of human health in Russia, Turkey, and certain Balkan, Central Asian, Middle Eastern and North African countries. We retained the right to commercialize SCY-078 in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. We received an upfront payment of $1.5 million and are entitled to receive up to $18 million in payments if certain development and sales based milestones are achieved. We are also entitled to single digit percent royalty payments for products that do not fall under the patents and a royalty percentage in the teens for products that do fall under the patents. This agreement expires upon R-Pharm’s last royalty payment, which is the later of 12 years from the first registration of the product in the countries where R-Pharm’s license rights exist under this agreement, or the last to expire of the patents in such countries. Either party may terminate this agreement if the other party breaches and fails to remedy the breach after receiving notice from the non-breaching party. We have the ability to terminate this agreement if we determine that R-Pharm fails to make reasonable progress in the development and commercialization of SCY-078. If we give R-Pharm notice of failure to make reasonable progress, R-Pharm will have the opportunity to correct the deficiencies.
The original agreement also included terms whereby R-Pharm would reimburse us for certain research and development costs associated with Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials of oral SCY-078 and the development of an IV formulation of SCY-078. However, these cost reimbursement terms required that the clinical trials and the IV formulation development follow a global development plan that was agreed upon by both parties in August 2013. Subsequent to August 2013, modifications were made to the global development plan that caused the clinical trial cost reimbursement terms in the original agreement to no longer be enforceable. Further, the IV formulation development cost reimbursement terms in the original agreement did not specify which IV formulation and development costs were reimbursable by R-Pharm. In November 2014, we entered into a supplemental arrangement with R-Pharm, whereby R-Pharm was informed of the modified IV formulation development plan and R-Pharm agreed to reimburse us for specifically identified IV formulation development and 
 12

manufacturing costs incurred by us. The specifically identified costs were defined as all costs incurred by us under a separate arrangement we have with a third-party service provider, whereby the third-party service provider is performing certain IV formulation and development services for us. We estimate that total reimbursable costs pursuant to the original agreement and supplemental arrangement with R-Pharm will be approximately $1.3 to $1.9 million.
Government Regulation 
Government regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. drug approval process
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recall requests, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication, subject to on-going IRB review;


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current Good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, regulations and guidance, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.

Preclinical studies
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
 13

Clinical trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which in some cases may overlap or be combined:
Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population with the target disease to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population with the target disease, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials sometimes cannot be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 studies.
In some circumstances, the FDA may also order a sponsor to conduct post-approval clinical trials if new safety information arises raising questions about the drug’s risk-benefit profile. Those clinical trials are typically referred to as Post-Marketing Requirements, or PMRs.
GAIN Act
The FDA has various expedited development programs, including break-through therapy, fast track designation and priority review, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that meet certain qualifications. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
The GAIN Act is intended to encourage development of new antibacterial and antifungal drugs for the treatment of serious or life-threatening infections by providing certain benefits to sponsors, including extended exclusivity periods, fast track and priority review. To be eligible for these benefits a product in development must seek and be awarded designation as a Qualifying Infectious Disease Product, or QIDP.
To qualify as a QIDP according to the criteria established in the GAIN Act, a product must be an antibacterial or antifungal drug for human use intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including, those:

(1) | caused by an antifungal resistant pathogen, including novel or emerging infectious pathogens; or


(2) | qualifying pathogens listed by the FDA in accordance with the GAIN Act.

Fast Track Designation
The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the 
 14

potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a Fast Track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor's request.
If a drug candidate is granted Fast Track designation, the sponsor may engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, and the FDA may review sections of the NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA's time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. Additionally, Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Pediatric exclusivity
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of regulatory protection to the term of any existing exclusivity, including the non-patent exclusivity periods described above, and to the regulatory term of any patent that has been submitted to FDA for the approved drug product. This six-month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study or studies in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study or studies.
Qualified Infectious Disease Product exclusivity
If the NDA for a QIDP is approved by the FDA, the FDA will extend by an additional five years any non-patent marketing exclusivity period awarded, such as a five-year exclusivity period awarded for a new chemical entity. This extension is in addition to any pediatric exclusivity extension awarded. Eligibility for the extension will be denied if the product is approved for uses that would not meet the definition of a QIDP.
Foreign regulation
To market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Pharmaceutical coverage, pricing and reimbursement
Our ability to commercialize our product candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which the United States and foreign governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors establish appropriate coverage and reimbursement levels for our product candidates and related treatments. In many of the markets where we would commercialize a product following regulatory approval, the prices of pharmaceutical products are subject to direct price controls (by law) and to drug reimbursement programs with varying price control mechanisms. Public and private health care payors control costs and influence drug pricing through a variety of mechanisms, including through negotiating discounts with the manufacturers and through the use of tiered formularies and other mechanisms that provide preferential access to certain drugs over others within a therapeutic class. Payors also set other criteria to govern the uses of a drug that will be deemed medically appropriate and therefore reimbursed or otherwise covered. In particular, many public and private health care payors limit reimbursement and coverage to the uses of a drug that are either approved by the FDA or that are supported by other appropriate evidence (for example, published medical literature) and appear in a recognized drug compendium. Drug compendia are publications that summarize the available medical evidence for particular drug products and identify which uses of a drug are supported or not supported by the available evidence, whether or not such uses have been approved by the FDA.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our product candidates and compositions, and their methods of use and other inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
As of March 1, 2017, we are the owner of 8 issued U.S. patents and 120 issued non-U.S. patents with claims to novel compounds, compositions containing them, processes for their preparation, and their uses as pharmaceutical agents, with terms 
 15

expiring between 2017 and 2036. Of these patents, one U.S. patent relates to SCY-078. We are actively pursuing two U.S. patent applications, one international (PCT) patent application and 30 non-U.S. patent applications in at least 23 jurisdictions.
Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of antifungal agents.
We believe that we have a strong intellectual property position and substantial know-how relating to the development and commercialization of SCY-078, including patents or patent applications covering inventions that we have co-invented with Merck. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology.
Our objective is to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to SCY-078 or derivatives thereof. We intend to pursue, maintain, and defend patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties, and to protect the technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business.
SCY-078
The patent portfolio for SCY-078 is directed to cover compositions of matter, formulation, methods of use and precursors or intermediaries in its preparation. This patent portfolio includes an issued U.S. patent and corresponding foreign national and regional counterpart patents and patent applications. The patents and patent applications relating to SCY-078 include patents and patent applications that were initially assigned to us and Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp, a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc. Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. subsequently assigned to us all of its rights in these patents and patent applications relating to SCY-078. The issued composition of matter patent (U.S. Patent No. 8,188,085), if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, and other governmental fees are paid, is expected to expire in 2030. Based on our current development plan, we believe that an additional term of up to five years for the SCY-078 U.S. patent may result from the patent term extension provision of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the Hatch-Waxman Act). We expect that the patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, and if appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, and other governmental fees are paid, would expire between 2030 and 2036, including any additional term from patent term adjustment or patent term extension. The patent term calculation method and the provisions under the Hatch-Waxman Act are described in the “Patent Term” section below. We are not currently aware of any third-party patents (other than patents we have licensed) encompassing SCY-078.
The terms of issued SCY-078 composition of matter patents in other jurisdictions (Algeria, Armenia, Australia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belize, Canada, China, Colombia, Europe, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mexico, Moldova, Morocco, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, Tajikistan, Tunisia, Turkmenistan and Ukraine), if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, and other government fees are paid, are expected to expire in 2030. These patents and patent applications (if applicable), depending on the national laws, may benefit from extension of patent term in individual countries. In some European countries, for example, a supplementary protection certificate, if obtained, provides a maximum of five years of market exclusivity. The duration of the supplementary protection certificate may be extended to five and a half years when the supplementary protection certificate relates to a human medicinal product for which data from clinical trials conducted in accordance with an agreed Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, have been submitted. Likewise, in Japan, the term of a patent may be extended by a maximum of five years in certain circumstances.
Patent Term
The term of individual patents and patent applications will depend upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application (or earliest filed parent application, if applicable).
Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the term of a patent that claims an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, or PTE. Eligibility for a PTE is based, in part, on whether the FDA approval of the drug represents the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the drug. Drugs that are considered to be new chemical entities under FDA’s regulations are generally eligible for PTE.
PTE permits patent term restoration of a U.S. patent as partial compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process, which includes both the testing period while the drug is being investigated under an IND and the approval period while FDA is reviewing a marketing application. The length of the patent term extension is half the testing period plus all of the approval period, with certain limitations. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to 
 16

five years beyond the expiration of the patent; however, a patent term extension cannot in any event extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval; only one patent that claims an approved drug may be extended; and the applicable approval must be the first approval of the product under the provision of law authorizing the approval. During the extension period, the patent holder’s rights under the patent are generally limited to approved uses of the product. Similar provisions may be available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of an NDA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering SCY-078 and its use in treating various diseases. As a specific example, if we are awarded the maximum length of PTE, our U.S. composition of matter patent relating to SCY-078 would have an expected expiration date of the earlier of 14 years from product approval or August 28, 2035. However, depending on any changes in our clinical path and the date of FDA approval, the PTE may not be granted, or may be less than the maximum.
 Proprietary rights and processes
We may rely, in some circumstances, on proprietary technology and processes (including trade secrets) to protect our technology. However, these can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors, and collaborators. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our proprietary technology and processes may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors, or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our proprietary technology and processes, please see the section on “Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property.”
