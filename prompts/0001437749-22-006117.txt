ITEM 1. BUSINESS
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
 
Startek, Inc. (“Startek”, the Company”, “we”, “our” or “us”) is a global customer experience (CX) solution provider supporting some of the world’s most iconic brands across a variety of markets. Operating under the Startek and Aegis brands, we enable enterprises to create human-centered relationships with their end customers, transform CX and accelerate digital and artificial intelligence (AI) enablement across all their touchpoints and channels. We do this through CX and analytics services, technology-led innovation and engagement solutions, and a complete range of services around the customer life cycle management process (CLM). Our solutions are supported by over 45,000 employees, delivering services from 45 locations in 13 countries on five continents. Each day, our CX experts work together to deliver personalized, meaningful brand-led experiences.

The Company was founded in 1987, centered on supply chain management services, including packaging, fulfillment, marketing support, and logistics services. After our initial public offering on June 19, 1997, we increasingly focused on operating customer care contact centers and grew to include our current suite of CX offerings. To remain strategically competitive while expanding our reach with new and existing clients, we acquired several companies from 2013 to 2015. On July 20, 2018, the Company acquired CSP Alpha Midco Pte Ltd, a Singapore private limited company (Aegis), which resulted in CSP Alpha Holdings Parent Pte Ltd, a Singapore private limited company (Capital Square Partners or CSP) owning a majority of the Company's outstanding shares. Capital Square Partners, a Singapore-based private equity fund, which owned Aegis, is the majority shareholder in the Company, owning approximately 56% of our outstanding shares. The combination greatly improved our competitive position in the market by providing us with access to many of the world’s most rapidly growing markets, offering services in many languages, offering a strong footprint and a foundation of operational excellence capabilities and industry best practices.

We offer CX solutions in almost every industry with tailored expertise in the telecoms, e-commerce and consumer, financial and business services, media and cable, travel and hospitality, technology, education and healthcare, energy and utilities sectors. We serve over 200 clients globally, many of whom are industry leaders in their respective verticals and geographies. We understand the industries in which our clients operate and the unique challenges they face, and we also understand the culture of the business or geography within which our services are delivered. We believe our knowledge of best practices across different industries coupled with an understanding of the solutions that can be implemented in the context of our clients’ operating environments, enables us to improve processes and performance metrics—driving measurable results that differentiate our clients from their competitors. The trust and confidence that our clients have in us are underscored by the long relationships we enjoy with many of our key clients; we have worked with our top five clients for more than nine years on average. We hold the distinction of being a global company with a local flair, one that allows our customers to derive efficiencies in service delivery from onshore, nearshore, and offshore locations. This multi-share capability allows us to craft customized experiences across cultures and continents.

Service Offerings
 
Startek offers a broad range of CX, technology, and back-office support solutions that are designed to help our clients gain a competitive advantage by transforming their operations. Our solutions align our clients’ unique requirements by being highly configurable, insight-driven, technology-led, and vertical-specific.
Customer Engagement
 
To stay ahead and stand apart, our clients' businesses need to sell not just a product or service, but a promise. One that is fulfilled by delivering consistent, creative human-centered customer-brand engagements. And we deliver that connection through omnichannel solutions delivered through our tech-enabled and empowered workforce. In the age of the digital consumer, we support customers throughout the entire lifecycle by driving interest, elevating experience, nurturing leads, delivering sales, reducing churn, and growing customer brand affinity with our CX-driven digital engagement services and solutions.
Omnichannel Engagement
 
Today, customers expect to connect immediately, have quick resolutions, and use self-service technologies without any compromise on experience. We help create seamless omnichannel CX and synchronize interactions between a brand and a customer – across channels. When clients want to cultivate and integrate engagement channels, we offer cloud-enabled omnichannel solutions to optimize all opportunities. We also enable clients to integrate diverse self-service technologies that are adaptive and agile in order to make the most of the cultivated leads that their brand spends money and time nurturing.
Social Media
 
Social media is pervasive in nature and harnessing its energy for business relevance is mandatory. We design and power human-intelligent social media support, technologies, and approaches across multiple channels. Our transformation experts ensure that our clients' social media campaigns and communities are performance-driven, brand-aligned, and nurture loyalty. Our approaches are underpinned by a combination of third-party tools and LISA our proprietary platform that tracks and monitors social conversation threads across numerous niche digital streams and helps clients derive actionable intelligence and opportunities. We work with brands from inception to maturity, as trusted partners, enabling our clients to realize true value by creating experiences and business outcomes that meet their needs and exceed customer expectations.
Customer Intelligence Analytics
 
A digitally-driven, customer-centric, and data-filled world requires intelligent decision-making. That means leveraging data, next-gen technologies, and capabilities. We consider analytics to be an essential arm of our digital offerings because our clients' businesses are only as competent as the insights that fuel them. We offer cutting-edge data environments, cloud-based platforms, AI-driven technologies, and data scientists who deliver insights. We use analytics to shape relationships, scale businesses, predict behaviors, segment customers and augment CX. This translates consumer insights and big data into initiatives that drive transformation and above-market growth.
Work from Home
 
Volatile market conditions, shortage of talent, and unprecedented challenges have driven widespread adoption of work from home (WFH) as a desirable operating model. Our approach is unique because it is highly secure, highly compliant, and highly flexible. We leverage a cloud-enabled virtual desktop for our agents with a bring your own device (BYOD) approach. A virtual command center, consisting of functional and business leaders is always on to enable real-time monitoring of business continuity across geographies. Data security is one of our strongest assets, we make use of AI-enabled applications that activate alerts, conduct monitoring, offer facial detection systems, watermark, mask secure content, and more – all to make our clients' businesses more resilient and agile. We retain client confidence with our proven, secure and compliant WFH technologies, deepening our clients’ connection with their customers through digital contactless customer communication.
Startek Cloud
 
In a rapidly changing world, the cloud empowers novel and flexible operating models. As part of our geo-strategy, accelerated by global shifts, we have moved to the Campus on Cloud framework. Startek Cloud is our next-generation, hybrid, omni-cloud platform. Integrated with AI capabilities, Startek Cloud enables agents to work in remote and home-based roles for increased business agility and continuity. With a foundation based on four pillars - virtual desktop cloud, web-enabled contact center, workforce management, and e-learning - it is a system that serves every real-time requirement, on-demand.
Back Office Services
 
To help clients enhance their customer-centric view of relationships while maximizing operating efficiencies, we provide finance and accounting services, human resource processing services, data management, and spend management services. These back-office services are designed to help our clients achieve their business objectives by automating repetitive processes and aligning human capital with business goals.

Our Clients
 
We develop long-term relationships with global corporations and medium-sized enterprises whose business complexities and customer focus require a strategic partner who can quickly and globally scale the tools, technology, and talent needed to design and deliver the desired CX. We provide these services to clients from our delivery campuses across North America, South America, Africa, Asia, Middle East and Australia.
 
As of December 31, 2021, we have a diverse client base of more than 200 clients across a variety of verticals, including companies that we believe are among the leading players in their respective industries. Approximately 32% of our revenue is derived from clients within the telecommunications industry, which has resulted in a rapidly evolving environment for service providers. Our focus is on the continued diversification of the industries we serve by targeting high-growth verticals such as e-commerce and consumer, financial and business services, healthcare and education, and travel and hospitality. Our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021, by industries served were as follows:
 

 | Year ended December 31, 2021
----------------------------------+-----------------------------
Telecom | 32% 
Media & Cable | 14% 
E-commerce & Consumer | 14% 
Healthcare & Education | 12% 
Financial & Business Services | 9% 
Travel & Hospitality | 7% 
Technology, IT & Related Services | 3% 
Other verticals | 9% 

 
In the year ending December 2021, our top five and ten clients represented 40% and 55% of total revenue, respectively. Master Service Agreements (MSAs) cover all our work for each client; these MSAs are typically multi-year contracts that may or may not include auto-renewal provisions. Although they typically do not include contractual minimum volumes and are generally terminable by the client without penalty upon prior written notice, our relationships with our top five clients have averaged around nine years, including multiple contract renewals for several of these clients.
 
Our clients’ CX needs, continue to evolve and expand beyond basic order processing or first-tier calls to handling complex issues that require advanced problem-solving skills, an in-depth understanding of their customers, sourcing the relevant technology capabilities to deliver personalized experiences, and building a highly qualified talent pool for managing CX. Digital outsourcing drivers for enterprises such as access to better technology, analytics, and omnichannel solutions are increasingly becoming more important than traditional outsourcing drivers. Our clients are looking to us to provide them with next-generation technology solutions to enable them to solve key business challenges. We are committed to partnering with our clients to deliver solutions that deliver world-class CX. We are investing in digital solutions and automation technologies that unlock customer insights using state-of-the-art digital technologies.
 
Key Competitive Differentiators
 
Our client base is largely comprised of leading global and regional brands. We believe our international footprint, world-class technology, and human capital solutions powered by Startek Cloud are ideally suited for these clients. These brands increasingly look to partner with service providers who embrace customer-centricity and proactively suggest innovative solutions to transform their CX operations. We believe we are well-positioned to succeed in this changing landscape and are differentiated by our insights and analytics, technology-led innovation, and customizable engagement solutions. Additionally, we believe our innovative human capital strategies and operational best practices are key competitive advantages. The successful execution of our principal corporate strategies depends on our competitive strengths, which are briefly described below:

Scale and Global Footprint
 
We are a truly global business with global clients, global management teams, global best practices, and global thinking. Our vast footprint provides clients with access to some of the world’s most rapidly growing markets, multilingual offerings, and the institution of operational best practices across the globe. Our scale, breadth, and capabilities also support clients with global business requirements by providing engagement services in the country or in geographical proximity based on their CX needs.
Customer Experience and Design
 
Our human-assisted digital approaches to help us define and build differentiated CX every step of the way in order to build brand loyalty and lifetime value. Our anytime-anywhere approach is based on knowing that customer or user experience is the basis of all decision-making. We design and deliver CX solutions through an integrated omnichannel customer contact management offering. Our primary focus is enabling brands to devise contact strategies that maximize the benefits of each channel, reducing customer effort and increasing ease of use.
Customer Lifecycle Management
 
Understanding the lifetime view of the client or customer is key in obtaining enhanced value. From initial lead to building long-term brand loyalty, we enable our clients to extend and foster healthier, holistic relationships with their customers not as a one-time option but as an ongoing process and relationship. We offer cradle-to-grave multilingual solutions across the customer life cycle and fulfillment across digitally enabled multilingual channels. From data-driven insights, attracting and retaining customers to converting sales, we help clients tailor personalized 1-2-1 services.
Process Innovation and Optimization
 
We free our clients from the burden of repetitive, mundane processes that take up time and effort. We assist them with change management and lead them to streamlined, global processes that drive them to the next level of maturity. We use global best practices, tools and methodologies to automate their business process, and, above all, deliver quality assurance.
Technological Excellence: a Serious Approach to Digital
 
We believe that Startek provides clients with unmatched infrastructure stability. We utilize a combination of industry best practices, internally developed tools, and a globally distributed team of engineers and support staff to centralize and standardize our worldwide delivery capabilities. This architecture enables us to deliver improved scalability and quality of delivery for our clients while lowering capital requirements and information technology operating costs. Our self-healing network, unique to the industry, also enables us to deliver every customer contact cleanly and with minimal downtime. Through automation and machine learning, we seamlessly identify faults in third-party applications and route around or drive repair. The stability of our infrastructure allows us to provide seamless contact delivery while also focusing on developing and delivering new, innovative offerings, including chatbots, AI, and neurolinguistic programming. Our IT solutions are not only technologically sound they also embody the principles of human communication science to ensure a better interactive experience for our client's customers.
Operational Excellence
 
Our operating platform provides the core processes that allow us to be consistent in our service offering across sites and geographies. It includes execution and innovation in every area of the operation including on-boarding and enabling employees, executing against goals, evaluating, and improving performance, and enhancing the total experience of our clients’ customers.
Human Capital
 
We have more than 30 years experience managing global talent and offer a consistent, scalable, and flexible workforce that is passionate about delivering the desired CX while meeting or exceeding our clients’ key business objectives. We consistently invest in forward-thinking strategies to attract, develop, reward, and retain top talent across our global enterprise.

We recognize our employees as the core of our success and provide them with learning opportunities, multicultural exposure, international work opportunities, and multiple career paths. As of December 31, 2021, we employ approximately 45,000 employees in 13 countries on five continents. Approximately 95% of our employees are located outside the U.S. Approximately 7% of our employees were members of a labor union or were covered by collective bargaining agreements, most of which are mandated under national labor laws outside the U.S. These agreements are subject to periodic renegotiations, and we anticipate that they will be renewed in the ordinary course of business without material impact to our business or in a manner materially different from other companies covered by such industry-wide agreements. We consider our employee relations to be good.
 
Strategy
 
We are committed to being the premier, high-performance partner for the world’s leading brands while generating profitable growth for our investors. Our merger with Aegis enables our clients to benefit from the wider global reach and access new markets, access greater multilingual offerings, and leverage new digital solutions. We believe that the foundation for our success is strong and we continue to realize synergies, revenue growth, and operating efficiencies from the combination. To that end, we plan to continue:

Driving a superior CX for our clients is at the center of everything we do. Our agents are on the front lines every day working to build and maintain strong customer relationships that drive sales, satisfaction, and loyalty for our client's brands. To help us accelerate revenue growth across the globe, we will continue to invest in our core CX solutions, including strengthening our consulting and analytics capabilities, technology-enabled platforms, and embedding findings from research in human communication science.
 
Seasonality
 
Our business can be seasonal depending on our clients' marketing programs and product launches. These are often geared toward the end of summer and the winter holiday buying season in the U.S. and during major local festival seasons across our other geographies.
Industry
 
The worldwide customer management business process outsourcing (CM BPO) market is projected to grow steadily at slightly above 4% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2023, according to industry research firms. By the end of 2023, it is estimated that the CM BPO industry will achieve a total market size of around $240 billion. Approximately 52% of worldwide BPO spend comes from the Americas region, while the Asia-Pacific region has the strongest growth (around 5% CAGR). Evolving buyer expectations to deliver next-generation CX will continue to fuel growth as brands increasingly turn to service providers to support their ongoing efforts for digital transformation.
 
The industry is also evolving to include key strategic elements beyond traditional contact centers and now includes CX consulting and digital CX services. Despite ongoing market consolidation through multiple mergers and acquisitions, this expanded scope of services driven by the digital CX needs of enterprises is likely to increase the market attractiveness for not only incumbent players but also for new providers with differentiated digital CX capabilities, according to industry research firm Everest Group.
 
Competition
 
The global contact center outsourcing market in which we operate is competitive. While many companies provide customer engagement solutions and services, we believe no single company is dominant in the industry. The industry itself continues to consolidate but remains very fragmented with the five largest competitors combined capturing less than 20% of the global market.
 
Our competitors vary by geography and business segment, and range from large, multinational corporations to smaller, narrowly focused enterprises. Across our lines of business, the principal competitive factors include client relationships, technology, and process innovation, integrated solutions, operational performance and efficiencies, pricing, and financial strength. We primarily compete with in-house customer management operations and other companies that provide CX management, including Alorica, Concentrix, Sitel Group, Sykes, TTEC, Teleperformance, and Transcom, among others. We also compete with smaller, specialized companies and divisions of multinational companies such as Accenture, Conduent, Infosys, Tech Mahindra, and Wipro, among others.
 
Many of these competitors are significantly larger than Startek in revenue, income, number of contact centers and customer service agents, number of product offerings, and market capitalization. We believe that while Startek is smaller than many of our competitors, we can compete because of our focus, scale, and ability to add value to our clients' businesses. Clients often select Startek to challenge these large competitors, because they want more innovation, flexibility, and speed to market.
 
Government and Environmental Regulation
 
We are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws in the countries, states, and territories in which we operate, including tax, employment, environmental and other laws that govern the way we conduct our business. There are risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including significant changes in domestic government programs, policies, regulatory requirements, and taxation with respect to foreign operations; unexpected changes in foreign government programs, policies, regulatory requirements, and labor laws; and difficulties in staffing and effectively managing foreign operations.
