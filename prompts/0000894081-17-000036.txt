ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Development of Business 
Air Transport Services Group, Inc. is a holding company that provides aircraft leasing, airline operations, aircraft maintenance and other support services to the air transportation and package delivery industries through its subsidiaries. We offer a range of complementary services to delivery companies, freight forwarders, airlines and government customers. We offer standalone services as well as bundled, customized solutions, scalable to our customers' needs. (When the context requires, we may use the terms “Company” and “ATSG” in this report to refer to the business of ATSG and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.) Our services are summarized below.
Aircraft leasing: We lease cargo aircraft through ATSG's leasing subsidiary, Cargo Aircraft Management, Inc. (“CAM”). CAM services global demand for medium range and medium capacity airlift by offering Boeing 767, 757 and 737 aircraft leases. CAM is able to provide competitive lease rates by converting passenger aircraft into cargo freighters. CAM monitors the medium passenger aircraft sale markets and acquires passenger aircraft based on projected into-service costs and rate of return targets, then manages the modification of passenger aircraft into freighters. As a result, the converted freighters can be deployed into regional markets more economically than larger capacity aircraft, newly built freighters or other competing alternatives. CAM's aircraft leases are typically under multi-year agreements. 
ACMI services: ATSG wholly owns two airlines, ABX Air, Inc. (“ABX”) and Air Transport International, Inc. (“ATI”), each independently certificated by the U.S. Department of Transportation. The Company's airlines separately offer a combination of aircraft, crews, maintenance and insurance services. These services and commonly referred to as ACMI services or CMI services depending on the selection of services contracted. ABX operates Boeing 767 freighter aircraft, while ATI operates Boeing 767 and Boeing 757 freighter and 757 "combi" aircraft. Combi aircraft are capable of carrying passengers and cargo containers on the main flight deck. The airlines can conduct cargo operations worldwide. 
Support services:  Customers who lease our aircraft typically need related services, such as scheduled aircraft maintenance, aircraft line maintenance, crew training and other transportation related solutions which our subsidiaries can provide. The support services we provide to delivery companies, freight forwarders and other airlines provide us with a competitive advantage for diversification and incremental revenues. Our businesses and subsidiaries providing support services are summarized below: 

• | ABX provides flight crew training, flight simulator rental and aircraft line maintenance services.


• | Airborne Maintenance and Engineering Services, Inc. (“AMES”) is an aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul business. AMES provides airframe maintenance, component repairs, engineering services and aircraft line maintenance. 


• | Pemco World Air Services, Inc. ("Pemco") provides aircraft maintenance, modifications, and engineering services.


• | AMES Material Services, Inc. ("AMS") resells and brokers aircraft parts.


• | LGSTX Services, Inc. (“LGSTX”) provides material handling and ground equipment maintenance and ground equipment rentals for aircraft support; LGSTX also sells aviation fuel. 


• | LGSTX Distribution Services, Inc. ("LDS") operates mail and parcel sorting centers.

The business development and marketing activities of our operating subsidiaries are supported by the Company's Airborne Global Solutions, Inc. ("AGS") subsidiary. AGS markets the various services and products offered by our subsidiaries by bundling solutions that leverage the entire portfolio of our subsidiaries' capabilities and experience in global cargo operations. Our bundled services are flexible and scalable to complement the customers own resources to support operational growth. Further, AGS assists our subsidiaries in achieving their sales and marketing plans by identifying customers' business and operational requirements while providing sales leads. 
The Company is incorporated in Delaware and its headquarters is in Wilmington, Ohio. ATSG's common shares are publicly traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol ATSG. ATSG was formed in 2007 for the purpose of creating a holding company structure from the reorganization of ABX, which was incorporated in 1980. Between 1980 and August 2003, ABX was an affiliate of Airborne, Inc. (“Airborne”), a former publicly traded, integrated delivery service provider. On August 15, 2003, ABX was separated from Airborne and became an independent publicly traded 
 1

company, in conjunction with the acquisition of Airborne by an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of DHL Worldwide Express, B.V. In 2004, we established LDS to provide mail sorting services to the United States Postal Service, ("USPS"). The Company acquired CAM, ATI and Capital Cargo International Airlines, Inc. ("CCIA") on December 31, 2007. ATI began operations in 1979 and was an affiliate of BAX Global, Inc. (“BAX/Schenker”) prior to 2006. In 2009, a significant portion of the aircraft maintenance operations of ABX, including a hangar facility in Wilmington, were spun-out into AMES, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Similarly, in 2010, the material handling and aviation ground support operations of ABX were spun-out into a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, now known as LGSTX. During 2013, we merged CCIA into ATI, with ATI as the surviving entity. 
In January 2014, the Company acquired a 25 percent equity interest in West Atlantic AB of Gothenburg, Sweden. West Atlantic AB, through its two airlines, Atlantic Airlines Ltd. and West Atlantic Sweden AB, operates a fleet of approximately 45 aircraft. West Atlantic AB operates its aircraft on behalf of European regional mail carriers and express logistics providers. The airlines operate a combined fleet of British Aerospace ATPs, Bombardier CRJ-200-PFs, and Boeing 767 and 737 aircraft. 
 In 2015, the Company and DHL Network Operations (USA), Inc. and its affiliates ("DHL") amended and extended the operating agreements under which we lease and operate aircraft for DHL. The Company has had long term contracts with DHL since August 2003. In 2010, we entered into commercial agreements with DHL under which DHL leased thirteen Boeing 767 freighter aircraft from CAM and ABX operates those aircraft under a separate crew, maintenance and insurance (“CMI”) agreement. The initial term of the CMI agreement was five years, while the terms of the aircraft leases were seven years. Effective April 1, 2015, the Company and DHL amended and restated the CMI agreement ("restated CMI agreement") extending the Boeing 767 aircraft lease terms through March 2019, reducing monthly aircraft lease rates for the thirteen Boeing 767-200 freighter aircraft approximately 5%, and leasing two additional Boeing 767 aircraft which were previously supporting DHL under short-term operating arrangements.
In September 2015, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement to establish an express cargo airline serving multiple destinations within the Peoples Republic of China (including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) and surrounding countries. The airline will be based in mainland China with registered capital of 400 million RMB (US$63 million). It will be established pending the receipt of required governmental approvals and plans to commence flight operations in 2017. We expect to contribute approximately $15 million to the joint venture in the next twelve months. We plan to offer the new airline aircraft leases to build its fleet. 
In September 2015, we began to operate a trial air network for Amazon Fulfillment Services, Inc. (“AFS”), a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”). We provided cargo handling and logistical support as the network grew to five dedicated Boeing 767 freighter aircraft during 2015. On March 8, 2016, the Company and AFS entered into an Air Transportation Services Agreement (the “ATSA”). The ATSA became effective April 1, 2016. Pursuant to the ATSA, CAM will lease 20 Boeing 767 freighter aircraft to AFS, including 12 Boeing 767-200 freighter aircraft for a term of five years and eight Boeing 767-300 freighter aircraft for a term of seven years. Under the ATSA, our airline subsidiaries operate those aircraft for an initial term of five years while our LGSTX subsidiary provides hub and gateway services for AFS at certain airports. As of December, 31, 2016, CAM leased 12 Boeing 767-200 freighter aircraft and two Boeing 767-300 freighter aircraft to AFS that were operated by our airlines. The remaining six aircraft are scheduled to enter service for AFS during 2017. CAM owns all 20 aircraft that will be leased and operated under the ATSA.
In conjunction with the execution of the ATSA, the Company and Amazon entered into an Investment Agreement and a Stockholders Agreement. The Investment Agreement calls for the Company to issue warrants in three tranches, which will grant Amazon the right to acquire up to 19.9% of the Company’s outstanding common shares measured as further described below. The exercise price of the warrants will be $9.73 per share, which represents the closing price of ATSG’s common shares on February 9, 2016. The first tranche of warrants, issued upon execution of the Investment Agreement, grants Amazon a right to purchase approximately 12.81 million ATSG common shares, with the right to purchase 7.69 million common shares vesting upon issuance and the right to purchase the remaining 5.12 million common shares vesting as ATSG delivers additional aircraft leased under the ATSA, or as the Company achieves specified revenue targets in connection with the ATSA. Through the second tranche of warrants, Amazon has a right to purchase approximately 1.59 million ATSG common shares, issuable on the second anniversary of the date of the Investment Agreement and will vest immediately upon issuance. The third tranche of warrants will be issued upon the date that is four years and six months after the date of the Investment Agreement, and will also vest immediately upon issuance. The third tranche of warrants will grant Amazon the right to purchase such additional number of ATSG common shares as is necessary to bring Amazon’s ownership to 19.9% of the Company’s pre-transaction outstanding 
 2

common shares measured on a GAAP-diluted basis, adjusted for share issuances and repurchases by the Company following the date of the Investment Agreement, after giving effect to the issuance of the warrants. Each of the three tranches of warrants will be exercisable in accordance with its terms through the fifth anniversary of the date of the Investment Agreement. We anticipate making the common shares underlying the warrants available through a combination of share repurchases and the issuance of additional shares. The Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company in May of 2016 to increase the number of authorized common shares and to approve the exercise in full of the warrants as required under the rules of the Nasdaq Global Select Market. 
In December 2016, the Company acquired Pemco. Pemco provides aircraft maintenance, modification, and engineering services. Pemco is based at the Tampa International Airport where it operates a two-hangar aircraft facility of 311,500 square feet and employs approximately 370 people. Pemco is a leading provider of passenger-to-freighter conversions for Boeing 737-300 and 737-400 aircraft, having redelivered over 50 Boeing 737 converted aircraft to Chinese operators over ten years. We intend to operate Pemco as a division of AMES and market Pemco's aircraft conversion capabilities and aircraft hangar operations with our other air transportation support services. 
Financial Information
The Company has two reportable segments, “ACMI Services" and "CAM." Due to the similarities among the Company's airline operations, they are aggregated into the ACMI Services segment. Our other business operations, including aircraft maintenance, engineering and modification services; aircraft part sales; equipment leasing and maintenance; and mail and package handling do not constitute reportable segments due to their size. Customer revenues for 2016 are summarized below. Additional financial information about our segments and geographical revenues is presented in Note N to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

 | CAM | ACMI Services | Support services 
External revenues (in thousands) | $117,642 | $492,859 | $158,369 
Subsidiaries and businesses | CAM | ABX, ATI | ABX, AMES, AMS, GFS, LDS, LGSTX

DHL is our largest customer. Business with DHL totaled 34% of the Company's consolidated revenues in 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the Company, through CAM, leased 16 Boeing 767 aircraft to DHL; 14 of which were being operated by the Company's airlines for DHL. Additionally, the airlines operated five CAM-owned Boeing aircraft under other operating arrangements with DHL. The U.S. Military comprised 12% of the Company's consolidated revenues in 2016, stemming primarily from revenue generated by operating four Boeing 757 combi aircraft. Amazon comprised 29% of the Company's consolidated revenues in 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the Company, through CAM, leased 12 Boeing 767-200 aircraft and two Boeing 767-300 aircraft to Amazon; all of which were being operated by the Company's airlines for Amazon. Additionally, ATI operated one CAM-owned Boeing 767-300 for Amazon.
Description of Business
CAM
CAM leases aircraft to ATSG's airlines and to external customers, including DHL and Amazon, usually under multi-year contracts with a schedule of fixed monthly payments. Under a typical lease arrangement, the customer maintains the aircraft in serviceable condition at its own cost. At the end of the lease term, the customer is typically required to return the aircraft in approximately the same maintenance condition that existed at the inception of the lease, as measured by airframe and engine time since the last scheduled maintenance event. CAM examines the credit worthiness of potential customers, their short and long-term growth prospects, their financial condition and backing, the experience of their management, and the impact of governmental regulation when determining the lease rate that is offered to the customer. In addition, CAM monitors the customer’s business and financial status throughout the term of the lease.

As of December 31, 2016, CAM’s fleet consisted of 60 serviceable Boeing 767 and 757 cargo aircraft. A complete list of the Company's aircraft is included in Item 2, Properties. Through CAM, we have expanded in recent years the Company's combined fleet of Boeing 767 and 757 aircraft. CAM has managed the modification of passenger aircraft into cargo aircraft as well as purchased previously modified cargo aircraft. Since the beginning of 2014, CAM has deployed eight Boeing 767-300 and one Boeing 757 aircraft into its fleet. 
ACMI Services
Through the Company's two airline subsidiaries, we provide airline operations to DHL, Amazon, delivery companies, other airlines, freight forwarders and the U.S. Military. A typical operating agreement requires our airline to supply, at a specific rate per block hour and/or per month, a combination of aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance ("ACMI") for specified cargo operations. The customer is responsible for substantially all other aircraft operating expenses, including fuel, landing fees, parking fees and ground and cargo handling expenses. The airlines also operate charter agreements, including with the U.S. Military, which require the airline to provide full service, including fuel and other operating expenses, in addition to aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance, for a fixed, all-inclusive price. 
Our airlines operate medium payload and medium wide-body aircraft freighters usually on intra-continental flights and medium range inter-continental flights. The airlines typically operate our aircraft in the customers' regional networks that connect to and from global cargo networks. We do not operate larger capacity, long haul inter-continental freighters such as the Boeing 747, 777 or Airbus A380 aircraft. The freighter types we operate have lower investment and ongoing maintenance costs and can operate cost efficiently with smaller loads on shorter routes than the larger capacity freighters. 
Our airlines provide airlift to the Air Mobility Command ("AMC") through contracts awarded by the U.S. Transportation Command ("USTC"), both of which are organized under the U.S. Military. ATI contracts with the AMC for the operation of its unique fleet of four Boeing 757 "combi" aircraft, which are capable of simultaneously carrying passengers and cargo containers on the main flight deck. ATI has been operating combi aircraft for the U.S. Military since 1993. The USTC awards flights to U.S. certificated airlines through annual contracts and awarded ATI three international routes for combi aircraft, with the current annual contract extending through September of 2017. These routes are not based on or related to conflicts in the Middle East. 
Our airlines participate in the Department of Defense ("DOD") Civil Reserve Air Fleet ("CRAF") program which entitles our airlines to bid for military cargo charter operations. Our airlines may operate temporary "expansion" routes for the U.S Military using the Boeing 757 combi and Boeing 767 freighter aircraft. Our participation in the CRAF program allows the DOD to requisition specified aircraft for military use during a national defense emergency. 
Approximately 8% of the Company's consolidated revenues for 2016 were derived from providing airline operations for customers other than DHL, Amazon and the U.S. Military. These ACMI and charter operations are typically provided to delivery companies, freight forwarders or other airlines.
Demand for air cargo services correlates closely with general economic conditions and the level of commercial activity in a geographic area. Stronger general economic conditions and growth in a region typically increase the need for product transportation. Historically, the cargo industry has experienced higher volumes during the fourth calendar quarter of each year due to increased shipments during the holiday season. Generally, time-critical delivery needs, such as just-in-time inventory management, increase the demand for air cargo delivery, while higher costs of aviation fuel generally reduces the demand for air delivery services. When aviation fuel prices increase, shippers will consider using ground transportation if the delivery time allows. 
We have limited exposure to fluctuations in the price of aviation fuel under contracts with our customers. DHL, like most of our ACMI customers, procures the aircraft fuel and fueling services necessary for their flights. Our charter agreements with the U.S. Military are based on a preset pegged fuel price and include a subsequent true-up to the actual fuel prices.
Aircraft Maintenance and Modification Services
We provide aircraft maintenance and modification services to other air carriers through our ABX, AMES and Pemco subsidiaries. These subsidiaries have technical expertise related to aircraft modifications through a long history in aviation. They own many Supplemental Type Certificates (“STCs”). An STC is granted by the FAA and represents an ownership right, similar to an intellectual property right, which authorizes the alteration of an airframe, engine or 
 4

component. We market their capabilities by identifying aviation-related maintenance and modification opportunities and matching them to our capabilities.
AMES operates a Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) certificated 145 repair station in Wilmington, Ohio, including hangars, a component shop and engineering capabilities. AMES is AS9100 quality certified for the aerospace industry. AMES’ marketable capabilities include the installation of avionics systems and flat panel displays for Boeing 757 and 767 aircraft. In 2014, the Company completed the construction of a new hangar facility bringing the total hangar square footage to 310,000. The hangar provides the capability of servicing airframes as large as the Boeing 747-400 and the Boeing 777 aircraft. AMES has the capability to perform line maintenance and airframe maintenance on McDonnell Douglas MD-80, Boeing 767, 757, 737, 777, 727 and Airbus A320 aircraft. AMES also has the capability to refurbish airframe components, including approximately 60% of the components utilized by Boeing 767 aircraft.
Pemco operates a Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) certificated 145 repair station from a two hangar facility in Tampa, Florida. Pemco has the capability to perform airframe maintenance on Boeing 767, 757, 737, McDonnell Douglas MD-80, Airbus A320 and various regional jet model aircraft. Pemco also has the capability to perform aircraft modification and engineering services, including passenger-to-freighter and passenger-to-combi conversions for Boeing 737-200, Boeing 737-300 and Boeing 737-400 series aircraft. 
Aircraft Parts Sales and Brokerage
AMS is an Aviation Suppliers Association, ASA 100 Accredited reseller and broker of aircraft parts. AMS carries an inventory of Boeing 767, 757, 737 and DC-9 spare parts and also maintains inventory on consignment from original equipment manufacturers, resellers, lessors and other airlines. AMS customers include the commercial air cargo industry, passenger airlines, aircraft manufacturers and contract maintenance companies serving the commercial aviation industry, as well as other resellers.
Equipment and Facility Maintenance
LGSTX provides contract maintenance services for material handling equipment and aviation ground support equipment throughout the U.S. LGSTX has a large inventory of ground support equipment, such as power units, airstarts, deicers and pushback vehicles that it rents to airports, airlines and other customers. LGSTX is also licensed to resell aircraft fuel. 
Mail and Package Sorting
We have provided mail sorting services under contracts with the USPS since September 2004. Our subsidiary, LDS, manages USPS mail sort centers in Indianapolis, Dallas and Memphis. Under each of these three contracts, we are compensated at a firm price for fixed costs and an additional amount based on the volume of mail handled at each sort center. LDS also provides labor for load transfer services to the USPS at two facilities. The contracts for the five facilities we service have been extended from their original expiration dates in 2014, through the end of March 2017 with renewal options, at the discretion of the USPS, for periods into 2018. LDS also provides international mail forwarding services through the John F. Kennedy International Airport and the O'Hare International Airport. LGSTX also provides similar services to AFS at certain locations in the U.S. served by our airlines under the ATSA. AFS can terminate these services at one or any location after giving a brief notice period. 
Flight Support 
ABX is FAA-certificated to offer flight crew training to customers and rent usage of its flight simulators for outside training programs. ABX has three flight simulators in operation. ABX’s Boeing 767 and DC-9 flight simulators are level C certified. The level C flight simulators allow ABX to qualify flight crewmembers under FAA requirements without performing check flights in an aircraft. 
The Company's subsidiary, Global Flight Source, Inc., ("GFS") provides aircraft dispatch and flight monitoring to ABX and ATI. GFS can provide these services to U.S certificated supplemental air carriers and foreign air carriers.

Competitive Conditions
Our airline subsidiaries compete with other cargo airlines to place aircraft under ACMI arrangements and charter contracts. Other cargo airlines include Amerijet International, Inc., Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc., Kalitta Air LLC, and National Air Cargo Group, Inc. The primary competitive factors in the air cargo industry are operating costs, fuel efficiency, geographic coverage, aircraft range, aircraft reliability and capacity. The cost of airline operations is significantly impacted by the cost of flight crewmembers, which can vary among airlines depending on their collective bargaining agreements. Cargo airlines also compete for cargo volumes with passenger airlines that have substantial belly cargo capacity. The air cargo industry is capital intensive and highly competitive, especially during periods of excess capacity of aircraft compared to cargo volumes. 
The scheduled delivery industry is dominated by integrated door-to-door delivery companies including DHL, TNT Holdings B.V., the USPS, FedEx Corporation, United Parcel Service, Inc. and AFS. Although the volume of our business is impacted by competition among these integrated carriers, we do not usually compete directly with them.
Competition for aircraft lease placements is generally affected by aircraft type, aircraft availability and lease rates. We target our leases to cargo airlines and delivery companies seeking medium widebody airlift. The Airbus A300-600 and A330 aircraft can provide capabilities similar to the Boeing 767 for medium widebody airlift. Competitors in the aircraft leasing markets include GE Capital Aviation Services and Guggenheim Aviation Partners, among others. 
The aircraft maintenance industry is labor intensive and typically competes based on cost, capabilities and reputation for quality. U.S. airlines may contract for aircraft maintenance with maintenance and repair organizations ("MROs") in other countries or geographies with a lower labor wage base, making the industry highly cost competitive. Other aircraft MROs include AAR Corp and Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Co. 
Airline Operations
Flight Operations and Control
Each of the Company's airline operations are conducted pursuant to authority granted to them by the FAA and the Department of Transportation ("DOT"). Airline flight operations, including aircraft dispatching, flight tracking, crew training and crew scheduling are planned and controlled by personnel within each airline. The Company staffs aircraft dispatching and flight tracking 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. The FAA prescribes the requirements, methods and means by which air carrier flight operations are conducted, including but not limited to the qualifications and training of flight crew members, the release of aircraft for flight, the tracking of flights, the time crew members can be on duty, aircraft operating procedures, proper navigation of aircraft, compliance with air traffic control instructions and other operational functions.
Aircraft Maintenance
Our airlines’ operations are regulated by the FAA for aircraft safety and maintenance. Each airline performs routine inspections and airframe maintenance in accordance with applicable FAA-approved aircraft maintenance programs. In addition, the airlines build into their maintenance programs FAA-mandated Airworthiness Directive and manufacturer Service Bulletin compliance on all of their aircraft. The airlines’ maintenance and engineering personnel coordinate routine and non-routine maintenance requirements. Each airline’s maintenance program includes tracking the maintenance status of each aircraft, consulting with manufacturers and suppliers about procedures to correct irregularities and training maintenance personnel on the requirements of its FAA-approved maintenance program. The airlines contract with MROs, including AMES, to perform heavy maintenance on airframes and engines. Each airline owns and maintains an inventory of spare aircraft engines, auxiliary power units, aircraft parts and consumable items. The quantity of spare items maintained is based on the fleet size, engine type operated and the reliability history of the item types.
Security
The Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) requires our air carriers to comply with security protocols as set out in each carrier’s standard all-cargo aircraft operator security plan containing extensive security practices and procedures that must be followed. The security plan provides for the conducting of background checks on those with access to cargo and/or aircraft, the securing of the aircraft while on the ground, the acceptance and screening of cargo 
 6

to be moved by air, the handling of suspicious cargo and the securing of cargo ground facilities, among other requirements. Comprehensive internal audit and evaluation programs are actively mandated and maintained. 
Customers are required to inform the airlines in writing of the nature and composition of any freight which is classified as "Hazardous Materials" and “Dangerous Goods” by the DOT. Notwithstanding these procedures, our airline subsidiaries could unknowingly transport contraband or undeclared hazardous materials for customers, which could result in fines and penalties and possible damage to the aircraft.
Insurance
Our airline subsidiaries are required by the DOT to carry a minimum amount of aircraft liability insurance. Their aircraft leases, loan agreements and ACMI agreements also require them to carry such insurance. The Company currently maintains public liability and property damage insurance, and our airline subsidiaries currently maintain aircraft hull and liability insurance and war risk insurance for their respective aircraft fleets in amounts consistent with industry standards. CAM’s customers are also required to maintain similar insurance coverage.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, the Company had approximately 3,230 full-time and part-time employees. The Company employed approximately 450 flight crewmembers, 1,405 aircraft maintenance technicians and flight support personnel, 670 warehousing, sorting and logistics personnel, 440 employees for airport maintenance and logistics, 50 employees for sales and marketing and 215 employees for administrative functions. In addition to full time and part time employees, the Company typically has approximately 350 temporary employees mainly serving the USPS operations and aircraft line maintenance operations. On December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately 2,170 full-time and part-time employees. 
Labor Agreements
The Company’s flight crewmembers are unionized employees. The table below summarizes the representation of the Company’s flight crewmembers at December 31, 2016.

Airline | Labor Agreement Unit | ContractAmendableDate | Percentage ofthe Company’sEmployees
ABX | International Brotherhood of Teamsters | 12/31/2014 | 8.8% 
ATI | Air Line Pilots Association | 5/28/2014 | 5.1% 

In addition, the Company has approximately 30 flight attendants that are represented by a recognized labor unit and are beginning to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement. Under the Railway Labor Act (“RLA”), as amended, the crewmember labor agreements do not expire, so the existing contract remains in effect throughout any negotiation process. If required, mediation under the RLA is conducted by the National Mediation Board, which has the sole discretion as to how long mediation can last and when it will end. In addition to direct negotiations and mediation, the RLA includes a provision for potential arbitration of unresolved issues and a 30-day “cooling-off” period before either party can resort to self-help, including, but not limited to, a work stoppage.
Training
The flight crewmembers are required to be licensed in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (“FARs”), with specific ratings for the aircraft type to be flown, and to be medically certified as physically fit to operate aircraft. Licenses and medical certifications are subject to recurrent requirements as set forth in the FARs, to include recurrent training and minimum amounts of recent flying experience.
The FAA mandates initial and recurrent training for most flight, maintenance and engineering personnel. Mechanics and quality control inspectors must also be licensed and qualified to perform maintenance on Company operated and maintained aircraft. Our airline subsidiaries pay for all of the recurrent training required for their flight crewmembers and provide training for their ground service and maintenance personnel. Their training programs have received all required FAA approvals. Similarly, our flight dispatchers and flight followers receive FAA approved training on the airlines' requirements and specific aircraft.

Intellectual Property
The Company owns many STCs issued by the FAA. The Company uses these STCs mainly in support of its own fleets; however, AMES and Pemco have marketed certain STCs to other airlines.
Information Systems
We are increasingly dependent on technology to maintain regulatory compliance, improve information communications and reduce costs in order to compete effectively. The Company has invested significant management and financial resources in the development of information systems to facilitate flight and maintenance operations. We utilize systems to maintain records about the maintenance status and history of each major aircraft component, as required by FAA regulations. Using the systems, we track maintenance schedules and also control inventories and maintenance tasks, including the work directives of personnel performing those tasks. In addition, the Company’s flight operations systems coordinate flight schedules and crew schedules. We have developed and procured systems to track crewmember flight and duty times, and crewmember training status.
Regulation
Our subsidiaries’ airline operations are primarily regulated by the DOT, the FAA and the TSA. Those operations must comply with numerous economic, safety, security and environmental laws, ordinances and regulations. In addition, they must also comply with various other federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations.
Environment
Under current federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or clean-up of hazardous or toxic substances on, under, or in such property. These laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, the presence of contamination from hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to properly clean up contaminated property, may adversely affect the ability of the owner of the property to use the property as collateral for a loan or to sell such property. Environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which a property may be used or transferred or in which a business located thereon may be operated and may impose remediation or compliance costs.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") is authorized to regulate aircraft emissions and has historically implemented emissions control standards adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization ("ICAO"). In 2015, however, the EPA issued a proposed finding on GHG emissions from aircraft and its relationship to air pollution. The final finding is a regulatory prerequisite to the EPA’s adoption of a new certification standard for aircraft emissions. Our subsidiaries’ aircraft currently meet all known requirements for engine emission levels as applicable by engine design date. Under the Clean Air Act, individual states or the EPA may adopt regulations requiring reductions in emissions for one or more localities based on the measured air quality at such localities. These regulations may seek to limit or restrict emissions by restricting the use of emission-producing ground service equipment or aircraft auxiliary power units. Further, the U.S. Congress has, in the past, considered legislation that would regulate greenhouse gas emissions, and some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future.
In addition, the European Commission has approved the extension of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme ("ETS") for greenhouse gas emissions to the airline industry. Currently, under the European Union’s ETS, all ABX and ATI flights that are wholly within the European Union are covered by the ETS requirements, and each year our airlines are required to submit emission allowances in an amount equal to the carbon dioxide emissions from such flights. If the airline's flight activity during the year produced carbon emissions exceeding the number of carbon emissions allowances that it had been awarded, the airline must acquire allowances from other airlines in the open market. ABX and ATI operate intra-EU flights from time to time and management believes that such flights are operated in compliance with ETS requirements.
To allow time for negotiations on a global market-based measure applying to aviation emissions, the EU's ETS requirements were suspended for flights in 2012 to and from non-European countries. For the period 2013-2016, the legislation has also been amended so that only emissions from flights within the European Economic Area fall under the EU ETS. 
 8

Recently, ICAO adopted a new regulatory requirement mandating operators in countries that are party to the regulation (most developed countries have signed onto the program) to offset their excess emissions above the 2020 baseline levels by purchasing qualifying carbon offset credits from greenhouse gas reduction and limitation projects in other industries. The first two phases of the regulatory arrangement, from 2021 to 2026, will be voluntary and countries may join or opt out of the scheme at any time. From 2027 to 2035, it will be mandatory, except for those countries, flights and operators specifically exempt from the rule. The engines used to power the aircraft currently operated by the Company's airlines comply with the newly proposed standard and would not require modification to be able to continue to operate after the rule, if adopted as proposed, takes effect.  Adoption of the ICAO international standard will prevent individual countries or unions from imposing unilateral measures on international aviation, such as the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS).
Exemptions for operators with low emissions have also been introduced. The EU made this change following agreement by the ICAO Assembly in October 2013 to develop a global market-based mechanism addressing international aviation emissions by 2016 and to apply it by 2020. The amended law provides for the European Commission to report to the European Parliament and Council on the outcome of the 2016 ICAO Assembly and propose measures as appropriate to take international developments into account with effect from 2017.
Recently, ICAO proposed for adoption greenhouse gas emissions rules applicable to aviation. If the rules are adopted by the ICAO governing body, they would set emissions standards beginning in 2020. The mechanism to reduce emissions is based on a reduction in the amount of fuel burned during the cruise portion of flight. The engines used to power the aircraft currently operated by the Company's airlines comply with the newly proposed standard and would not require modification to be able to continue to operate after the rule, if adopted as proposed, takes effect. Although these rules, if adopted, will not apply to any of our airline subsidiaries’ existing aircraft, additional rules could be adopted in the future that would either apply these more stringent noise and emissions standards to aircraft already in operation or require that some portion of the fleet be converted over time to comply with these new standards.
The federal government generally regulates aircraft engine noise at its source. However, local airport operators may, under certain circumstances, regulate airport operations based on aircraft noise considerations. The Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 provides that, in the case of Stage 3 aircraft (all of our operating aircraft satisfy Stage 3 noise compliance requirements), an airport operator must obtain the carriers’ consent to, or the government’s approval of, the rule prior to its adoption. We believe the operation of our airline subsidiaries’ aircraft either complies with or is exempt from compliance with currently applicable local airport rules. However, some airport authorities have adopted local noise regulations, and, to the extent more stringent aircraft operating regulations are adopted on a widespread basis, our airline subsidiaries may be required to spend substantial funds, make schedule changes or take other actions to comply with such local rules.
Department of Transportation
The DOT maintains authority over certain aspects of domestic air transportation, such as requiring a minimum level of insurance and the requirement that a person be “fit” to hold a certificate to engage in air transportation. In addition, the DOT continues to regulate many aspects of international aviation, including the award of international routes. The DOT has issued ABX a Domestic All-Cargo Air Service Certificate for air cargo transportation between all points within the U.S., the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The DOT has issued ATI certificate authority to engage in scheduled interstate air transportation, which is currently limited to all-cargo operations. ATI's DOT certificate authority also authorizes it to engage in interstate and foreign charter air transportation of persons, property and mail.  Additionally, the DOT has issued ABX and ATI Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity authorizing each of them to engage in scheduled foreign air transportation of cargo and mail between the U.S. and all current and future U.S. open-skies partner countries, which currently consists of 120 foreign countries.  ABX also holds exemption authorities issued by the DOT to conduct scheduled all-cargo operations between the U.S. and certain foreign countries with which the U.S. does not have an open-skies air transportation agreement.  
By maintaining these certificates, the Company, through its airline subsidiaries, can conduct all-cargo charter operations worldwide subject to the receipt of any necessary foreign government approvals. Prior to issuing such certificates, and periodically thereafter, the DOT examines a company’s managerial competence, financial resources and plans, compliance, disposition and citizenship in order to determine whether the carrier is fit, willing and able to engage in the transportation services it has proposed to and does undertake.

The DOT has the authority to impose civil penalties, or to modify, suspend or revoke our certificates and exemption authorities for cause, including failure to comply with federal laws or DOT regulations. A corporation holding the above-referenced certificates and exemption authorities must qualify as a citizen of the United States, which, pursuant to federal law, requires that (1) it be organized under the laws of the U.S. or a state, territory or possession thereof, (2) that its president and at least two-thirds of its Board of Directors and other managing officers be U.S. citizens, (3) that less than 25% of its voting interest be owned or controlled by non-U.S. citizens, and (4) that it not otherwise be subject to foreign control. We believe our airline subsidiaries possess all necessary DOT-issued certificates and authorities to conduct our current operations and each continue to qualify as a citizen of the United States.
Federal Aviation Administration
The FAA regulates aircraft safety and flight operations generally, including equipment, ground facilities, maintenance, flight dispatch, training, communications, the carriage of hazardous materials and other matters affecting air safety. The FAA issues operating certificates and detailed "operations specifications" to carriers that possess the technical competence to conduct air carrier operations. In addition, the FAA issues certificates of airworthiness to each aircraft that meets the requirements for aircraft design and maintenance. ABX and ATI believe they hold all airworthiness and other FAA certificates and authorities required for the conduct of their business and the operation of their aircraft, although the FAA has the power to suspend, modify or revoke such certificates for cause, or to impose civil penalties for any failure to comply with federal laws and FAA regulations.
The FAA has the authority to issue regulations, airworthiness directives and other mandatory orders relating to, among other things, the inspection, maintenance and modification of aircraft and the replacement of aircraft structures, components and parts, based on industry safety findings, the age of the aircraft and other factors. For example, the FAA has required ABX to perform inspections of its Boeing 767 aircraft to determine if certain of the aircraft structures and components meet all aircraft certification requirements. If the FAA were to determine that the aircraft structures or components are not adequate, it could order operators to take certain actions, including but not limited to, grounding aircraft, reducing cargo loads, strengthening any structure or component shown to be inadequate, or making other modifications to the aircraft. New mandatory directives could also be issued requiring the Company’s airline subsidiaries to inspect and replace aircraft components based on their age or condition. As a routine matter, the FAA issues airworthiness directives applicable to the aircraft operated by our airline subsidiaries, and our airlines comply, sometimes at considerable cost, as part of their aircraft maintenance program.
In addition to the FAA practice of issuing regulations and airworthiness directives as conditions warrant, the FAA has adopted new regulations to address issues involving aging, but still economically viable, aircraft on a more systematic basis. FAA regulations mandate that aircraft manufacturers establish aircraft limits of validity and service action requirements based on aircraft flight cycles and flight hours before which widespread fatigue damage might occur. Service action requirements include inspections and modifications to preclude development of widespread fatigue damage in specific aircraft structural areas. The Boeing Company has provided its recommendations of the limits of validity to the FAA, and the FAA has now approved the limits for the Boeing 757 and 767 model aircraft. Consequently, after the limit of validity is reached for a particular model aircraft, air carriers will be unable to continue to operate the aircraft without the FAA first granting an extension of time to the operator. There can be no assurance that the FAA would extend the deadline, if one were to be requested. For the oldest aircraft in our fleets, we estimate the limit of validity would not be reached for at least 20 years. 
The FAA requires each of the airline subsidiaries to implement a drug and alcohol testing program with respect to all employees and, unless already subject to testing, contractor employees that engage in safety sensitive functions. Each of the airlines complies with these regulations.
Transportation Security Administration
The TSA, an administration within the Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for the screening of passengers, baggage and cargo and the security of aircraft and airports. Our airline subsidiaries comply with all applicable aircraft and cargo security requirements. The TSA has adopted cargo security-related rules that have imposed additional burdens on our airlines and our customers. Among other things, the TSA requires each airline to perform criminal history background checks on all employees. In addition, we may be required to reimburse the TSA for the cost of security services it may provide to the Company’s airline subsidiaries in the future.

International Regulations
When operating in other countries, our airlines are subject to aviation agreements between the U.S. and the respective countries or, in the absence of such an agreement, by principles of reciprocity. International aviation agreements are periodically subject to renegotiation, and changes in U.S. or foreign governments could result in the alteration or termination of the agreements affecting our international operations. Commercial arrangements such as ACMI agreements between our airlines and our customers in other countries, may require the approval of foreign governmental authorities. Foreign authorities may limit or restrict the use of our aircraft in certain countries. Also, foreign government authorities often require licensing and business registration before beginning operations. 
Other Regulations
Various regulatory authorities have jurisdiction over significant aspects of our business, and it is possible that new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretations thereof could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition to the above, other laws and regulations to which we are subject, and the agencies responsible for compliance with such laws and regulations, include the following:

• | The labor relations of our airline subsidiaries are generally regulated under the Railway Labor Act, which vests in the National Mediation Board certain regulatory powers with respect to disputes between airlines and labor unions arising under collective bargaining agreements;


• | The Federal Communications Commission regulates our airline subsidiaries’ use of radio facilities pursuant to the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended;


• | U.S. Customs and Border Protection inspects cargo imported from our subsidiaries’ international operations;


• | Our airlines must comply with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services regulations regarding the citizenship of our employees;


• | The Company and its subsidiaries must comply with wage, work conditions and other regulations of the Department of Labor regarding our employees.


• | The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy, which may limit our business activities in and for certain areas.
