Company Overview 
Akumin Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company”) is a corporation that was formed on August 12, 2015 through an amalgamation of two companies incorporated under the Ontario Business Corporations Act. On September 30, 2022, the Company changed its jurisdiction of incorporation from the province of Ontario, Canada, to the State of Delaware (the “Domestication”). The Company discontinued its existence as a corporation under Section 181 of the Ontario Business Corporations Act and, pursuant to Section 388 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), continued its existence under the DGCL as a corporation incorporated in the State of Delaware. 
In connection with the Domestication, the outstanding common shares of the Company were converted, on a one-for-one basis, into shares of common stock of the Company (“Common Stock”), respectively, as a corporation incorporated in the State of Delaware. The business, assets and liabilities of the Company, as well as its principal place of business and fiscal year, were the same immediately after the Domestication as they were immediately prior to the Domestication.
The Company provides fixed-site outpatient diagnostic imaging services through a network of approximately 180 owned and/or operated imaging locations; and outpatient radiology and oncology services and solutions to approximately 1,100 hospitals and health systems across 48 states. Our imaging procedures include magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”), computerized tomography (“CT”), positron emission tomography (“PET” and “PET/CT”), ultrasound, diagnostic radiology (X-ray), mammography, and other related procedures. Akumin’s cancer care services include a full suite of radiation therapy and related offerings. 
We are significantly diversified across business lines, geographies, modality offerings and reimbursement sources. The diversity of our business provides a number of advantages, including having no material revenue concentration with any health system or hospital customer and no material concentration with any commercial payor. 
As of the date of this Annual Report, Akumin has a total of approximately 3,631 employees on a full-time or part-time basis. 
Industry Overview 
Radiology Overview 
Radiology represents an essential capability of a hospital or health system, driving and influencing many downstream care processes across multiple medical service lines. Radiology services are utilized across virtually all disease categories in early, rapid and accurate detection, diagnosis, treatment planning and monitoring, and directly impact high focus areas such as patient safety, patient experience, length of hospital stay and downstream healthcare resource utilization. Radiology services also play a critical role in providing quality and efficient healthcare, as nearly every individual in the United States will require some form of diagnostic imaging and resulting radiology interpretation for a significant clinical indication during his or her lifetime. 
As a result of this widespread adoption, healthcare systems across the world and their affiliated physicians rely on efficient and effective radiology operations as well as concise and timely radiologist interpretations to make fully informed care decisions and to keep their hospital and outpatient operations running smoothly and efficiently. 
In diagnostic radiology, the typical patient journey includes (i) a referral from a physician, who orders an exam to assist with diagnosing or treating a condition, (ii) the procurement of the diagnostic image, usually carried out by a technologist specialized in the particular procedure or modality, and (iii) an interpretation from a radiologist who reads and interprets the images and produces a report of their findings and recommendations, which is provided back to the referring physician for use in the next step of the patient’s care. The referring physician often consults with the radiologist to choose the appropriate modality, which could include advanced imaging techniques such as MRI, CT, and PET, or routine imaging techniques such as X-ray, mammography, ultrasound, fluoroscopy, or nuclear medicine. 
Medical imaging technologies continue to evolve and play a critical role in cost-effective patient diagnosis and treatment. While X-rays are the most common imaging procedure, more sophisticated and higher reimbursement procedures, such as MRI, CT and PET scans, are the fastest growing. 
Radiology exams can be performed at a hospital’s main radiology department or in an outpatient setting, including hospital outpatient departments, physician offices or independent diagnostic testing facilities. Outpatient diagnostic imaging centers are primarily used to provide medical imaging services to patients who are ambulatory (meaning, they are not in the ER or 
inpatient) and who have been referred by a third-party physician. Standard offerings include routine screening and diagnostic imaging procedures such as X-ray, mammography and ultrasound along with more advanced, complex and costly services, such as MRI, CT and PET, in addition to other diagnostic and interventional radiology procedures. 
Outpatient diagnostic imaging is generally more cost efficient compared to imaging performed in the traditional inpatient or on-campus hospital setting. We believe that this dynamic, combined with the convenience of outpatient care for patients, will result in outpatient imaging growth outpacing the overall radiology market. The gap in pricing between traditional hospital in-patient facilities and freestanding outpatient facilities has been a significant area of focus for government and third-party payors, who in an effort to curtail costs, have adopted over time a number of policies to drive price transparent, site-neutral reimbursements for advanced outpatient imaging procedures, and steerage to lower-cost, outpatient entities. Payors have also increased requirements for pre-authorization of advanced diagnostic procedures in an effort to ensure the medical necessity of those procedures. We anticipate that these trends will continue to drive procedure volume toward outpatient settings, both freestanding and hospital-outpatient. We believe these trends will drive a need for hospitals and health systems to engage service providers such as us to provide services and support to build their outpatient radiology capabilities. 
The size of the freestanding outpatient diagnostic imaging market in the United States is estimated at more than $19 billion in annual industry revenue. The diagnostic imaging market is highly competitive, consisting of owner-operator radiologists, freestanding outpatient diagnostic imaging centers and hospitals. We also face competition from other diagnostic imaging companies in acquiring diagnostic imaging centers. There are estimated to be more than 6,000 freestanding outpatient diagnostic imaging centers in the United States. The landscape in the outpatient diagnostic imaging industry is highly fragmented. 
We believe the outpatient diagnostic imaging industry reimbursement will remain stable for the foreseeable future. Contributing to this outlook is the expectation of relatively stable Medicare reimbursement rates. After a downward trend in reimbursement from 2007 to 2014, Medicare reimbursements have generally stabilized. From 2015 to 2020, there was limited fluctuation in Medicare reimbursements, though radiology services experienced a rate cut in 2021. Medicare reimbursement rates were stable in 2022. 
In addition to a relatively stable Medicare reimbursement outlook, which we believe is often used as a benchmark in the industry, we also believe the industry will see increasing imaging volumes in the outpatient space. Since becoming a mainstream medical diagnostic mechanism in the 1990’s, utilization of diagnostic imaging has drastically increased. Over the last few decades, the imaging industry has developed significantly through improvements in technology, the development of various outpatient imaging sites of service, and the continued increase in the number of patients seeking out imaging procedures for both screening and diagnosis. Large outpatient imaging center operators, such as Akumin, are in a position to benefit from these industry dynamics. Scale, reputation and operating excellence will likely be key drivers of performance for the various industry players. 
There are a number of factors that we believe will drive the growth of the radiology industry, including: 
•Aging demographics: The number of people over the age of 65 in the United States is expected to increase significantly, largely owing to the subset of aging baby boomers. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the “65+” population will outnumber individuals under the age of 18 by 2034. As the overall U.S. population continues to age, the need for affordable and easily accessible healthcare procedures will expand proportionally. According to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) in 2019, senior citizens, defined as those who are 65 years old or older, made up only 16% of the total U.S. population, yet accounted for 35% of healthcare-related spending. The vast growth in the elderly population is expected to positively impact the financial landscape of the overall healthcare industry. 
•Greater Consumer Awareness for Earlier Intervention and Preventative Screening: Greater consumer awareness for early intervention and increased emphasis on preventive screening have changed the perception of imaging from a luxury service to an essential part of the diagnostic process. Commercial payors are encouraging the appropriate use of diagnostic imaging and of preventative screenings to help decrease overall costs by reducing more expensive procedures over the long-run.
•Technological Advances Leading to More Use Cases for Radiology: We believe that further technological advancements will allow for even earlier and more effective diagnosis of diseases and disorders through less invasive methods, further driving demand for diagnostic imaging services. Additionally, the industry is seeing a shift towards the adoption of innovative technology in areas such as Artificial Intelligence (“AI”), which has the potential to transform diagnostic imaging and help with early diagnosis. 
Oncology Overview 
Radiation therapy is the practice of delivering ionizing radiation to treat malignant and benign disease processes under the direction of a radiation oncologist. Radiation therapy is primarily used to treat cancer patients, as it kills cancer cells and reduces tumors via the highest possible dose of radiation, in order to destroy the cancerous cells while minimizing exposure to healthy surrounding tissue. 
We specialize in the deployment and utilization of two primary targeted radiation therapy modalities: Linear accelerator (“Linac”) and guided robotic stereotactic radiosurgery (“SRS”). Both are utilized to treat the most common and some of the deadliest cancers in the U.S., including breast, lung, prostate, colon, melanoma and brain cancer. Within the broader scope Linac and SRS therapy options, we provide access to several additional radiation treatment options, including: 
•Three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (“3D-CRT”): 3D-CRT uses three-dimensional imaging data and three-dimensional treatment planning to more accurately and effectively plan and deliver Linac radiation treatments. It is the most common form of technology used in practices and may be supplanted by intensity modulated radiation therapy (“IMRT”) or in conjunction with image guided radiation therapy (“IGRT”) when the specific case requires a higher level of precision or conformality. 
•IMRT: IMRT entails the use of multiple beams of radiation delivered by a Linac whose intensity is adjusted individually during the actual daily treatment delivery to allow the radiation that is delivered to conform as closely as possible to the three-dimensional volume of the tumor and simultaneously reduce the dose to neighboring normal healthy tissues. It requires extremely sophisticated and time-consuming treatment planning to determine what beam shapes and orientations should be used and what their intensities should be to provide the optimal patient treatment based on the patient’s anatomy of normal tissues and the targeted tumor volume. Extensive treatment quality assurance is required to ensure that all the beams are modulated and delivered correctly. 
•IGRT: IGRT uses a number of different types of imaging technologies to localize precisely the patient and the tumor target volume at the time of each treatment delivery to ensure that the radiation is delivered to the correct location. IGRT is not a radiation treatment in and of itself; it is used in support of advanced forms of treatment delivery such as 3D-CRT, IMRT, stereotactic body radiotherapy (“SBRT”) and SRS. 
•SRS and SBRT: SRS was originally developed for intracranial applications. The technology is now being used in a range of extracranial applications such as spine, lung, prostate and other disease sites in the form of SBRT. SRS and SBRT deliver a very high dose of radiation in 1 to 5 treatments as opposed to the 10 to 40 treatments used for 3D-CRT, IMRT and IGRT. Due to the extremely high doses used for SRS and SBRT, the need for precision in the planning and delivery of the treatment is critical. SRS/SBRT is delivered with a range of advanced technologies such as the CyberKnife®, Gamma Knife®, BrainLab™, Novalis-Tx™, TrueBeam STx™, Trilogy™, VERO, TomoTherapy®, Elekta Infinity™ and Axesse™. 
•Low dose rate brachytherapy (“LDR”): LDR allows the radiation oncologist to treat cancer by delivering the dose of radiation from the “inside out.” Radioactive isotopes encased in a metal jacket the size of a grain of rice (“seeds”) are implanted directly in the tumor through needles, with the seeds permanently left in place, or left in place temporarily within catheters (thin hollow tubes) and removed with the catheters when treatment is completed. The radioactive isotopes decay over time (days to years) to an inert form and in the process gradually release ionizing radiation called gamma rays, which are generally of low energy and thus deposit their therapy over short distances, thereby treating the cancer over time (hours to days). 
•High dose rate brachytherapy (“HDR”): Like LDR, HDR allows the radiation oncologist to treat cancer by delivering the dose of radiation from the “inside out.” HDR utilizes temporary seeds, made of radioactive isotopes that deliver a much higher dose of radiation over a much shorter period of time. These seeds are inserted and removed several times, over several minutes, one to two times per day, for 1 to 10 treatments delivered over 1 to 45 days, through catheters that are left in place for the entire course of care and then removed when the treatment course is completed. 
Demand for cancer care is large and growing. Radiation therapy services are essential to cancer care with approximately 66% of cancer patients receiving radiation therapy as a part of their cancer care. As a result, the radiation therapy market is significant, with an estimated size of $3 billion. There are more than 2,300 radiation therapy centers across the country. 
Radiation therapy treatment relies on the execution of technical services coordinated with professional physician and other medical clinician services. There are a number of highly trained professionals involved in the workflow. Care is led by the radiation oncologist, a specially trained physician who works with other physicians and the full radiation therapy staff to 
oversee each patient’s treatment and coordinates the most appropriate radiation therapy approach for each patient. The medical physicist assures the accurate delivery of all aspects of treatment, oversees dosimetrists, and ensures that treatments are properly planned specifically for each patient. The dosimetrist designs the treatment plan (including dose distributions and calculations) for a prescribed course of therapy. This includes all specific dose calculations for each patient. The radiation therapist administers radiation therapy to patients via the specified equipment and monitors the patient during treatment. The radiation oncology nurse works with the patient and care team to provide support, care and resources before, during and after treatment. The center staff are team members who support clinical care and operations, which can include front desk staff, site administrators, navigators and others. 
There are a number of different Medicare payment methodologies for radiation therapy based on the site of service. Sites operating as an integrated department of the hospital are reimbursed under the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (“HOPPS”). Freestanding outpatient radiation therapy providers are reimbursed under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (“MPFS”). Reimbursement rates are typically higher for procedures performed at a hospital outpatient department (“HOPD”), which are off-campus outpatient centers that are clinically and financially integrated with the hospital. In recent years, there has been a shift towards site-neutral payments by lowering payments to HOPDs. In the 2019 Medicare HOPPS final rule, CMS set reimbursement rates for certain HOPD centers equal to 40% of HOPPS beginning in 2020 with an exception for certain HOPD centers that billed under HOPPS prior to November 2, 2015. 
Our oncology segment derives revenue from both HOPPS and MPFS. Approximately two-thirds of revenue is billed to the health system or hospital partner under contractual arrangements and the remaining one-third of revenue is billed directly to the payor. For sites that are contracted with hospitals or health systems, the majority of centers fall under HOPPS. These centers are not subject to some of the recent developments despite the shift to site neutrality since these centers have either been “grandfathered in” (as have been billing under HOPPS since prior to 2015) or are located on the hospital property. For sites that bill payors directly, the vast majority of sites bill under MPFS. 
Radiation therapy reimbursement has generally remained stable across our key areas of service, while site neutrality rules are expected to have minimal impact. In December 2015, Congress passed the Patient Access and Medicare Protection Act, which sought to develop an episodic alternative payment model for radiation therapy services. This resulted in the Radiation Oncology (“RO”) model, which aims to improve the quality of care for patients while moving towards a simplified and predictable payment system. The model will reimburse providers based on prospective, site neutral, episode-based payments for 90-day episodes. Participants will be paid in two installments per episode (beginning and end) with reimbursement split into professional (fee for physician services) and technical components (fee for use of the facility). The program also includes the reporting of performance on quality measures, clinical data, and patient experience, which will be factored into payments. The Protecting Medicare and American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act was enacted on December 10, 2021 and included a provision that prohibited implementation of the RO model prior to January 1, 2023. On August 29, 2022, CMS published a final rule in the Federal Register, CMS-5527-F2, which finalized delaying the current start date of the RO model to a date to be determined through future rulemaking. We believe our focus on clinical quality, operational efficiency, and value-based care, as well as our integrated service line approach, position us well for the new reimbursement model once it begins. 
Competitive Strengths 
Comprehensive radiology and oncology solutions provider 
We deliver a full suite of outsourced outpatient solutions to hospital, health system and physician group partners. We believe radiology and oncology are highly complementary business lines and there are a number of efficiencies to being able to offer both for our customers. Both radiology and oncology are clinically sophisticated, critical service lines for hospitals. As a result, hospitals often rely on third parties to provide these services and would benefit from being able to procure both services from a single provider. Providing both services also results in valuable referral network benefits, enables care management opportunities and opens the possibility of cost-based initiatives for oncology care. There is often overlap in the radiology and oncology patient base, since oncology patients require advanced imaging for effective diagnosis and staging efficient treatment and management of recurrence. 
In addition to the clinical benefits of offering both services, the business models of radiology and oncology are highly complementary. Both businesses are outpatient oriented, providing for significant health system partnership opportunities and complementary business development approaches. Both specialties have an impact on referral and patient care journeys and are administratively complex, which represents a key pain point for hospital administrators. In addition, offering both specialties allows us to take advantage of shared infrastructure, including physician outreach, strategic 
marketing, operations, quality and safety, logistics and supply chain, patient scheduling and prior authorizations, payor relations and contracting, revenue cycle management, accounting and finance, IT, HR, legal, compliance, and others. 
Well positioned to take advantage of long-term industry tailwinds 
We are well positioned to take advantage of many of the long-term trends in healthcare. In recent years, there has been an enhanced focus on patient experience and customer service. We pride ourselves on a commitment to excellence and patient satisfaction, including offering quality service, short wait and turnaround times, compassionate care and convenience to all patients. Our scale and operational expertise enable us to access the latest advances in technology and information systems and to offer hospital-level expertise within a local setting. Other trends in healthcare that will benefit us include an increased focus on early detection, strict standards for clinical quality, measurable patient satisfaction, and clinical care productivity and efficiency. Our ability to offer both radiology and oncology services puts us in a unique position to help detect and accurately diagnose cancer, and to guide and deliver more targeted, efficient and effective treatments. In addition, our proven approach to improving operational performance and best-in-class operational infrastructure allows us to deliver care efficiently with high productivity. 
We are well positioned to take advantage of the continued shift in care delivery from inpatient to outpatient locations as payors and patients increase their focus on increasing access and convenience and reducing costs. Our longstanding, shared focus on outpatient care delivery in both hospital and freestanding facilities offers unique expertise for hospitals, health systems and physician groups. As pressure to move to lower-cost sites of care increases for hospitals, our ability to assist them with both on and off-campus outpatient solutions will be impactful, as well as our ability to provide freestanding expertise in convenient locations, with shorter wait times, increased likelihood of subspecialty interpretations and faster turnaround times. 
Stable and diversified revenue base 
We benefit from a well-diversified stream of revenues that spans multiple service offerings, geographies, modality offerings, and physician networks. We believe that our diversified service offerings enable us to better serve our health system and hospital partners and offer “one-stop-shopping” for administrators charged with finding better outsourced solutions. 
We have no material revenue concentration in any health system or hospital customer or from any commercial insurance payor. We believe that this diversity in revenue sources decreases the risk to our business from the loss of any single customer or payor relationship, or changes to reimbursement rates from any single payor. 
Where we bill payors directly, we are also in-network with substantially all of our commercial payors and believe we are the ideal partner for payors who seek to provide high quality care to patients at a low cost. By partnering with the vast majority of all major payors in our geographic footprint, we are able to provide significant savings to our payor partners by ensuring patients stay within their networks using our system of conveniently located facilities. Payor reimbursement levels are negotiated via contracts with each individual payor. These contracts allow for separate reimbursement schedules for each of the payor’s respective clients, depending on the member’s individual coverage plan. 
Within our radiology segment, we leverage a large network of radiologists, with some radiologists working on-site and others working remotely. Given our vast network of radiologists and dynamic IT platform, we do not rely heavily on any single radiologist to drive business. Our scale and density within selected geographies allows us to create close, long-term relationships with local radiology groups and referring physicians. In addition, our multimodality imaging offering provides a one-stop-shop for patients and referring physicians. 
Partner of choice for health systems 
We have developed deep, long-standing relationships with approximately 1,100 hospitals and healthcare providers across the country. We have partnered with 23 of the 30 largest U.S. health systems. Our customers are health systems and hospitals seeking best-in-class partners to enable a capital efficient network and to expand their U.S. essential outpatient radiology and oncology services. 
We believe that healthcare trends will foster hospital- and health-system-centric models, even as shifts to lower-cost outpatient care continue and will allow us to expand our platform. As hospitals consolidate and seek partners with regional or national scale and expertise in different clinical settings, our national footprint enables us to leverage our position as a trusted partner to expand our services as an outsourced service partner. We are focused on building around the hospital’s existing network, patients and partnerships to assist our partners in delivering a full continuum of care within our 
communities; this legacy of hospital partnering will enable us to take advantage of favorable healthcare industry trends such as increasingly higher hospital expenditures, growing elderly population, higher cancer incidences, and increased patient flows to hospitals resulting from health system integrations, industry consolidation, and increased covered lives under the Affordable Care Act. 
Additionally, the industry is seeing a shift towards outsourced clinical services. Currently, we estimate that approximately 90% of hospitals already outsource, or are considering outsourcing, one or more services, and we estimate that expenditures by hospitals on outsourced services are growing by at least 5% per year. These market trends will drive demand for services, enabling us to capitalize on our hospital-centric strategy, providing a platform for expansion. 
Consumer driven brand development 
Our brand is defined by intentional engagement with critical decision makers, including a consistent focus on the consumer (including current or future patients, as well as patients’ loved ones). The consumer is at the heart of our strategy as increasing out of pocket costs, price transparency and access to sophisticated medical information online are changing consumer behavior in healthcare services. This is evidenced by the emergence of high deductible health plans. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that the percentage of U.S. workers enrolled in high deductible plans with a health savings account increased from approximately 4% in 2007 to approximately 28% in 2021. Our commitment to outreach, compassionate care, operational excellence and service delivery optimizes the consumer’s experience at our clinics. 
We provide a consistent patient experience, standardized through technology and investments in our people and processes. All patient facing employees are trained on delivering our brand promises by way of our intentional values, as well as our policies and procedures. Our brand strategy is focused on aligning our position in the market for the needs of our patients and partners, so that we are the go-to provider of outpatient diagnostic imaging and/or radiation therapy services to patients in our service areas. We strive to provide shorter waiting times, convenient locations, competitive pricing, compassionate and high-quality clinical care, quality equipment and software, concise interpretations by subspecialty radiologists and top-tier expertise and consistency. 
Business Strategy 
Continued strong organic volume growth 
Our organic growth strategy is based on a sales and marketing platform which utilizes relationships with local referring physicians and consumer engagement to drive new business. To ensure the continued strength of relationships with referring physicians, we employ a field-based sales team whose primary responsibility is establishing new relationships and maintaining existing relationships with referring physicians. Relationships with new referring physicians are developed through our value proposition (i.e., consistent service, excellent patient care and referring provider communications, contracts with substantially all payors, convenience and access to top subspecialty radiologists and radiation oncologists). Existing relationships are maintained by ensuring we continue to deliver our value proposition in a consistent manner. We stress the importance of operational excellence, which ultimately manifests itself in a better patient experience. 
To ensure continuous engagement with the community — including consumers, patients and their loved ones — we deploy a number of market-specific, direct-to-consumer marketing and communications strategies, focused largely on digital outreach (e.g., websites, search engine optimization, online reputation management, digital advertising and social media) and addressing consumers’ most critical questions: how to decide, what to expect, how to prepare, what they will pay and what will happen next. Our marketing strategies and tactics are coordinated through centralized resources with expertise in specific areas and on a shared platform to ensure compliance with healthcare marketing regulations. 
Within our radiology segment, in markets with robust demand, we will consider adding modalities in centers that are currently only single or dual modality centers. Multi-modality centers help diversify risk while contributing positively to our margins and provide referring physicians with a “one-stop shop” for their patients. To attain growth and offer a competitive differentiator in key markets, we will also consider replacing or adding new technologies and equipment. While reimbursement rates may not change with newer equipment, we believe this strategy, particularly in competitive markets, will offer us a market advantage which will ultimately lead to increased volumes. An example of this is our investment in 3D digital mammography, which is preferred by many women who can self-refer for mammography, and is now being reimbursed by many of the large national insurance payors in addition to Medicare. 
Cross-sell opportunities 
We plan to take advantage of cross-sell opportunities of additional services to existing customers. In particular, we believe that there is a significant competitive advantage to offering both radiology and oncology services to our hospital customers. Offering both services allows our hospital partners to procure multiple outsourced outpatient solutions from a single, high-quality provider. We plan to leverage our health system and hospital partnerships in radiology to cross-sell oncology services and vice-versa. 
Our radiology and oncology sales and business development teams regularly coordinate and collaborate their hospital efforts. We plan to continue and further strengthen this sales strategy with a focus on selling an entire suite of outpatient solutions rather than single specialty services. 
Form new hospital partnerships 
We believe there is an opportunity to enhance existing and form new hospital partnerships as hospitals continue to accelerate the development of their outpatient care strategies. We believe that these enhancements could result in enhanced volume growth at existing centers, and the new relationships could result in the potential to open or service new centers. We plan to leverage our expertise in forming new, and growing existing, hospital partnerships. 
Proven acquisition strategy 
We have significant experience in acquiring and integrating business into our platform, improving the operational performance of those businesses, and realizing synergies. Our acquisition strategy is led by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Riadh Zine. Mr. Zine has grown Akumin through a carefully executed, highly acquisitive, strategy based on a distinct set of criteria: (i) market density, (ii) market growth potential, (iii) operational integration potential, (iv) assets and compliance assessment and (v) attractive valuation multiples. We look to acquire individual or portfolios of centers that have a meaningful presence in their respective market and a high potential for organic growth. 
Regulation 
General 
The healthcare industry is highly regulated, and changes in the regulatory environment could significantly affect our operations in the future. Our ability to operate profitably will depend in part upon us obtaining and maintaining all necessary licenses and other approvals and operating in compliance with applicable healthcare regulations. We believe healthcare regulations will continue to change. Therefore, we monitor developments in healthcare law and modify our operations from time to time as the business and regulatory environment change. 
Licensing and Certification Laws 
Ownership, construction, operation, expansion and acquisition of diagnostic imaging centers, oncology centers and establishment of radiology and oncology service lines are subject to various federal and state laws, regulations and approvals concerning licensing or certification of facilities and personnel. In addition, free-standing diagnostic imaging centers that provide services not performed as part of a physician’s office must meet Medicare requirements to be certified as an independent diagnostic testing facility before it can be authorized to bill the Medicare program. 
Corporate Practice of Medicine 
In many of the states in which we operate, a lay person or any entity other than a professional corporation or other similar professional organization is not allowed to practice medicine, including by employing professional persons or by having any ownership interest or profit participation in or control over any medical professional practice. The laws of such states also prohibit a lay person or a non-professional entity from exercising control over the medical judgments or decisions of physicians and from engaging in certain financial arrangements, such as splitting professional fees with physicians. We structure our relationships with the radiology practices, including the purchase of diagnostic imaging centers, in a manner that we believe keeps us from engaging in the practice of medicine, exercising control over the medical judgments or decisions of the radiology practices or their physicians, or violating the prohibitions against fee-splitting.
Medicare and Medicaid Fraud and Abuse – Federal Anti-kickback Statute 
During the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 11.0% of our net service revenue was derived from federal government sponsored healthcare programs (Medicare) and 1.7% from state sponsored programs (Medicaid). 
Federal law known as the Anti-kickback Statute prohibits among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Noncompliance with the federal Anti-kickback Statute can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs and civil and criminal penalties. 
The Anti-kickback Statute is broad, and it prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Voluntary statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protect certain business transactions and arrangements that are structured to comply fully with an applicable safe harbor. Although full compliance with these provisions ensures against prosecution under the federal Antikickback Statute, transactions and arrangements that do not satisfy all elements of a relevant safe harbor do not necessarily violate the law. When an arrangement does not satisfy a safe harbor, the arrangement must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis in light of the parties’ intent and the arrangement’s potential for abuse. 
Although some of our arrangements may not fall within a safe harbor, we believe that such business arrangements do not violate the Anti-kickback Statute, because we are careful to structure them to reflect fair market value and ensure the reasons underlying our decision to enter into a business arrangement comport with reasonable interpretations of the Anti-kickback Statute. However, even though we continuously strive to comply with the requirements of the Anti-kickback Statute, liability under the Anti-kickback Statute may still arise because of the intentions or actions of the parties with whom we do business. While we are not aware of any such intentions or actions, we have only limited knowledge regarding the intentions or actions underlying those arrangements. Conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy one of these safe harbor provisions may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as the OIG. 
Medicare and Medicaid Fraud and Abuse – Stark Law 
The Ethics in Patient Referrals Act of 1989, commonly known as the Stark Law, generally prohibits a physician who has (or whose immediate family member has) a financial relationship with a provider from making referrals to that entity for “designated health services” if payment for the services may be made under Medicare. If such a financial relationship exists, referrals are prohibited unless a statutory or regulatory exception is available. The Stark Law also prohibits the entity from billing for any such prohibited referral. The penalties for violating the Stark Law include a prohibition on payment by these governmental programs and civil penalties of as much as $27,750 for each violation referral and $185,009 for participation in a circumvention scheme, as of March 17, 2022. We believe that, although we receive fees under our service agreements for management and administrative services, we are not in a position to make or influence referrals of patients. 
Under the Stark Law, radiology and certain other imaging services and radiation therapy services and supplies are considered designated health services subject to the self-referral prohibition. Such services include the professional and technical components of any diagnostic test or procedure using X-rays, ultrasound or other imaging services, CT, MRI, radiation therapy and diagnostic mammography services (but not screening mammography services). PET and nuclear medicine procedures are also included as designated health services under the Stark Law. 
The Stark Law provides that a request by a radiologist for diagnostic radiology services, and a request by a radiation oncologist for radiation therapy, if such services are furnished by (or under the supervision of) such pathologist, radiologist, or radiation oncologist pursuant to a consultation requested by another physician does not constitute a referral by a referring physician. If such requirements are met, the Stark Law self-referral prohibition would not apply to such services. The effect of the Stark Law on the radiology practices, therefore, will depend on the precise scope of services furnished by the applicable physicians and whether such services derive from consultations or are self-generated. 
We believe that, other than self-referred patients, all of the services covered by the Stark Law provided by the contracted radiology practices and by radiation oncologists who are invested in our cancer centers derive from requests for consultation by non-affiliated physicians. Therefore, we believe that the Stark Law is not implicated by the financial relationships between our operations and the contracted radiology practices or the radiation oncologists who are invested in our cancer centers. In addition, we believe that we have structured our acquisitions of the assets of existing practices, and we intend to structure any future acquisitions, so as not to violate the Anti-kickback Statute, Stark Law and the regulations related to these laws. Specifically, we believe the consideration paid by us to physicians to acquire the tangible and intangible assets associated with their practices is consistent with fair market value in arms’ length transactions and is not intended to induce the referral of patients or other business generated by such physicians. Should any such practice be 
deemed to constitute an arrangement designed to induce the referral of Medicare or Medicaid patients, then our acquisitions could be viewed as possibly violating the Anti-kickback Statute. Determination of liability under any such laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Medicare and Medicaid Fraud and Abuse – General 
The federal Recovery Audit Program, among other program integrity audits, is part of the federal government’s effort to identify and correct improper Medicare payments by reviewing claims on a post-payment basis and detecting and collecting any overpayments made on claims of healthcare services provided to Medicare beneficiaries. These audits serve to intensify governmental scrutiny of individual providers. An unsatisfactory audit of any of our diagnostic imaging facilities, contracted radiology practices or radiation therapy centers could result in any or all of the following: significant repayment obligations, exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs, and civil and criminal penalties. 
Federal regulatory and law enforcement authorities have increased enforcement activities with respect to Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse regulations and other reimbursement laws and rules, including laws and regulations that govern our activities and the activities of the radiology practices, independent diagnostic testing facilities and radiation therapy centers. The federal government also has increased funding to fight healthcare fraud and is coordinating its enforcement efforts among various agencies, such as the U.S. Department of Justice, the OIG, and state Medicaid fraud control units. The government may investigate our or the radiology practices’ activities, claims may be made against us or the radiology practices and these increased enforcement activities may directly or indirectly have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
State Anti-kickback and Physician Self-referral Laws 
Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-kickback Statute and the Stark Law. Some of these state prohibitions apply to services and the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Although we believe that we comply with federal and state anti-kickback laws and self-referral laws, any finding of a violation of these laws could subject us to criminal and civil penalties or possible exclusion from federal or state healthcare programs or termination of contracts with private insurance payors. Any penalties or adverse actions would adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to operate our business.
Federal False Claims Act 
The federal False Claims Act provides, in part, that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person who it believes has knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved. The federal False Claims Act further provides that a lawsuit thereunder may be initiated in the name of the United States by an individual, a “whistleblower,” who is an original source of the allegations. The federal government has used the False Claims Act to prosecute a wide variety of alleged false claims and fraud allegedly perpetrated against Medicare and state healthcare programs, and the government has taken the position that claims presented in violation of the federal Antikickback Statute or Stark Law may be considered a violation of the federal False Claims Act. Penalties include civil penalties of not less than $12,537 and not more than $25,076 for each false claim as of March 17, 2022, plus three times the amount of damages that the federal government sustained because of the act of that person. In addition to civil enforcement under the False Claims Act, the federal government can use several criminal statutes to prosecute persons who are alleged to have submitted false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government. Any allegations or findings that we have violated the False Claims Act could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. 
Further, states are adopting false claims acts similar to the federal False Claims Act, which establish liability for submission of fraudulent claims to the state Medicaid program and contain whistleblower provisions. Even in instances when a whistleblower action is dismissed without judgment or settlement, we may incur substantial legal fees and other costs relating to an investigation. Future actions under the False Claims Act or state law equivalents may result in significant fines and legal fees, which would adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to operate our business. 
Whistleblower actions initiated under the federal False Claims Act may be pending but placed under seal by the court to comply with the False Claims Act’s requirements for filing such suits. As a result, they could lead to proceedings without our knowledge. Certain of our facilities and radiology practices have received and may receive, inquiries, civil 
investigative demands, or subpoenas from federal and state agencies. Governmental investigations, as well as whistleblower lawsuits, may lead to significant fines, penalties, settlements or other sanctions, including exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs. We are and have been subject to civil investigative demands and investigations from time to time regarding our compliance with physician supervision requirements for MRI procedures and other diagnostic imaging tests, as well as our sales and marketing practices and financial arrangements with physicians. Settlements of lawsuits involving Medicare and Medicaid issues routinely require both monetary payments and corporate integrity agreements. 
Healthcare Reform Legislation 
CMS uses a perceived equipment utilization rate to allocate the cost of equipment for purposes of determining physician service practice expenses, which influence the calculation of payment for physician services. In regulations promulgated in November 2009, CMS set the utilization rate at 90% for certain diagnostic equipment. Healthcare reform legislation enacted in 2010 required CMS to use a presumed equipment utilization rate of 75% in computing physician practice expense relative value units for advanced diagnostic imaging services (such as MRI, CT and PET). Excluded from the adjustment is low-technology imaging modalities such as ultrasound, X-ray and fluoroscopy. Raising the assumed equipment utilization rate changes the calculation in such a way that the per unit technical payment for each service is decreased. The higher utilization rate was fully implemented beginning in 2011. This utilization rate was further increased to 90% by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (“ATRA”), effective January 1, 2014. 
The aim of increased utilization of diagnostic imaging services is to spread the cost of the equipment and services over a greater number of scans, resulting in a lower cost per scan. These changes caused reductions in Medicare reimbursement for medical imaging and have resulted in decreased revenue for the scans we perform for Medicare beneficiaries. Other changes in reimbursement for services rendered by Medicare Advantage plans may also reduce the revenues we receive for services rendered to Medicare Advantage enrollees. 
On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). Among numerous changes to the tax code, the Tax Act repealed the individual mandate tax penalty (the “Individual Mandate”), a PPACA provision that required individuals to pay additional taxes if he or she was uninsured during the year. This change ultimately spurred several legal challenges to the Affordable Care Act, including the California v. Texas case, which was decided by the US Supreme Court in June 2021. Plaintiffs in the case argued, among other things, that the PPACA must fall in whole or in part because the constitutional basis authorizing congressional enactment of the law no longer was available. The Supreme Court ultimately upheld the healthcare reform law, even without the tax penalty on individuals. 
Repeal of the Individual Mandate may lead to more people being uninsured, and could raise premium rates for insured persons. Such a development could affect reimbursement, coverage, and utilization of diagnostic imaging services in ways that are currently unpredictable. The American Rescue Plan, enacted in March 2021, expanded the availability of advanced premium tax credits (APTCs) to eligible low- to moderate-income individuals who purchase insurance in the federal and state exchange marketplaces. As a result of this financial support, among other factors, health insurance enrollments through the exchange marketplaces hit all-time highs in 2021. These subsidies are available only for 2021 and 2022, and will expire without further congressional action. If Congress allows the subsidies to expire or be reduced, it is possible that fewer people may be insured in future years. Such a development could affect reimbursement, coverage, and utilization of diagnostic imaging services in ways that are currently unpredictable. Other changes to the PPACA (whether through legislation or judicial action), including further rollbacks or full repeal of the PPACA being sought by congressional and state members, or expansion of the PPACA (including, but not limited to, the development of a “public option” that would compete with private insurers to offer coverage to both individuals and those with employer sponsored insurance) being sought by the Biden Administration, could have similarly unpredictable effects. 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 
Congress enacted the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, in part, to combat healthcare fraud and to protect the privacy and security of patients’ individually identifiable healthcare information. HIPAA requires healthcare providers and their business associates to maintain the privacy and security of individually identifiable protected health information (“PHI”). HIPAA imposes federal standards for electronic transactions, for the security of electronic health information and for protecting the privacy of PHI. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”), signed into law on February 17, 2009, dramatically expanded, among other things, (1) the scope of HIPAA to now apply directly to “business associates,” or independent contractors who receive or obtain PHI in connection with providing a service to a covered entity, (2) substantive security and privacy obligations, including new federal security breach notification requirements to affected individuals, Department of Health and Human Services 
(“DHHS") and prominent media outlets, of certain breaches of unsecured PHI, (3) restrictions on marketing communications and a prohibition on covered entities or business associates from receiving remuneration in exchange for PHI, and (4) the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed for HIPAA violations, increasing the annual cap in penalties from $60,226 per violation and up to $1,806,757 per year. 
Certain states have also adopted comparable privacy and security laws and regulations, some of which may be more stringent than HIPAA. Such laws and regulations will be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities, thus creating potentially complex compliance issues for us. Further, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, on June 28, 2018, which went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Although there are limited exemptions for health-related information, including PHI maintained by a covered entity or a business associate, the CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States, which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business. Similar laws have been proposed in other states and at the federal level, and if passed, such laws may have potentially conflicting requirements that would make compliance challenging. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”), recently passed in California. The CPRA will impose additional data protection obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It will also create a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. The substantive provisions of CPRA have gone into effect as of January 1, 2023 (though enforcement of these provisions is delayed until July 1, 2023), and additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required. 
We believe that we are in compliance with the current HIPAA requirements, as amended by HITECH, and comparable state laws, but we anticipate that we may encounter certain costs associated with future compliance. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that enforcement agencies or courts will not make interpretations of the HIPAA standards that are inconsistent with ours, or the interpretations of our contracted radiology practices or their affiliated physicians. A finding of liability under the HIPAA standards may result in significant criminal and civil penalties. Noncompliance also may result in exclusion from participation in government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and a finding of noncompliance may have a significant reputational impact. These actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration or FDA 
The FDA has issued the requisite pre-market approval for all of the MRI and CT systems we use. 
Our mammography systems are regulated by the FDA pursuant to the Mammography Quality Standards Act of 1992, as amended by the Mammography Quality Standards Reauthorization Acts of 1998 and 2004 (collectively, the “MQSA”). All mammography facilities are required to meet the applicable MQSA requirements, including quality standards, be accredited by an approved accreditation body or state agency and certified by the FDA or an FDA-approved certifying state agency. Pursuant to the accreditation process, each facility providing mammography services must comply with certain standards that include, among other things, annual inspection of the facility’s equipment, personnel (interpreting physicians, technologists and medical physicists) and practices. 
Compliance with these MQSA requirements and standards is required to obtain Medicare payment for services provided to beneficiaries and to avoid various sanctions, including monetary penalties, or suspension of certification. Although the Mammography Accreditation Program of the American College of Radiology is an approved accreditation body and currently accredits all of our facilities that provide mammography services, and although we anticipate continuing to meet the requirements for accreditation, if we lose such accreditation, the FDA could revoke our certification. Congress has extended Medicare benefits to include coverage of screening mammography, but coverage is subject to the facility performing the mammography meeting prescribed quality standards described above. The Medicare requirements to meet the standards apply to diagnostic mammography and image quality examination as well as screening mammography. 
Healthcare Professional Licensing 
The radiologists and other healthcare professionals providing professional medical services at our facilities are subject to licensing and related regulations by the states in which they provide services. As a result, we require the radiology groups 
with which we contract to require those radiologists and other healthcare professionals to have and maintain appropriate licensure. We do not believe that such laws and regulations will either prohibit or require licensure approval of our business operations, although no assurances can be made that such laws and regulations will not be interpreted to extend such prohibitions or requirements to our operations. 
Insurance Laws and Regulation 
States in which we operate have adopted certain laws and regulations affecting risk assumption in the healthcare industry, including those that subject any physician or physician network engaged in risk-based managed care to comply with applicable insurance laws and regulations. These laws and regulations may require physicians and physician networks to meet minimum capital requirements and other safety and soundness requirements. Implementing additional regulations or compliance requirements could result in substantial costs to the contracted radiology practices, limiting their ability to enter into capitated or other risk-sharing managed care arrangements and indirectly affecting our revenue from the contracted practices. 
U.S. Federal Budget 
We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from direct billings to governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private health insurance companies and/or health plans, including but not limited to those participating in the Medicare Advantage program. As a result, any negative changes in governmental capitation or fee-for-service rates or methods of reimbursement for the services we provide could have a significant adverse impact on our revenue and financial results. 
Because governmental healthcare programs generally reimburse on a fee schedule basis rather than on a charge-related basis, we generally cannot increase our revenues from these programs by increasing the amount of charges for services. Moreover, if our costs increase, we may not be able to recover our increased costs from these programs. Government and private payors have taken and may continue to take steps to control the cost, eligibility for, use, and delivery of healthcare services as a result of budgetary constraints, cost containment pressures and other reasons. We believe that these trends in cost containment will continue. 
These cost containment measures, and other market changes in non-governmental insurance plans, have generally restricted our ability to recover, or shift to non-governmental payors, any increased costs that we experience. Our integrated care business and financial operations may be materially affected by these developments. 
Environmental Matters 
The facilities we operate or manage generate hazardous and medical waste subject to federal and state requirements regarding handling and disposal. We believe that the facilities that we operate and manage are currently in compliance in all material respects with applicable federal, state and local statutes and ordinances regulating the handling and disposal of such materials. We do not believe that we will be required to expend any material additional amounts in order to remain in compliance with these laws and regulations or that compliance will materially affect our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
