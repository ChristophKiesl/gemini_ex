Our Company
Weber Inc. (“Weber,” “Company,” “we,” and “our”), together with its affiliates, is the leading outdoor cooking company in the global outdoor cooking market. Our founder George Stephen, Sr., established the outdoor cooking category when he invented the original charcoal grill nearly 70 years ago. In the decades since, we have built a loyal and global following of both grilling enthusiasts and barbeque professionals in backyards all around the world. Our product portfolio includes traditional charcoal grills, gas grills, smokers, pellet and electric grills and recently our Weber Connect™ technology-enabled grills. Our full range of products are sold in 78 countries. 
We completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) in August 2021 and our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbol “WEBR.” 
We operate in the global outdoor cooking market, which is comprised of outdoor products that include gas grills, charcoal grills, wood pellet grills, electric grills, smokers, grilling accessories and solid fuel products (including charcoal briquettes, lump charcoal, pellets, wood chips and wood chunks). Our mission at Weber is to lead the outdoor cooking industry by innovating breakthrough new products and services that enhance our global consumers’ grilling experiences. Our purpose is to ignite inspiration and discovery through everything we do, at every touchpoint with our consumers. Grilling is about making delicious food, bringing people together and creating memories. Weber is an experience, a passion, a way of life and a journey to discover what grilling can be.

On October 24, 2022, the Company received a nonbinding acquisition proposal letter from BDT Capital Partners LLC, on behalf of its affiliates BDT Capital Partners Fund I, L.P., BDT Capital Partners Fund 3, L.P., and their respective affiliated funds (collectively, “BDT”) to acquire all outstanding shares of Class A common stock (each, a “Class A Share,” collectively, the “Class A Shares”) of the Company that it does not already own for $6.25 per Class A Share in cash in a “going-private” transaction (the “Proposed Transaction”). Prior to its receipt of the letter, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) had formed a special committee of independent directors (the “Special Committee”) to evaluate and consider any potential or actual transaction proposal from BDT and any other alternative proposals or other strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company, and the Special Committee retained independent financial and legal advisors to assist it. The Special Committee consists of two members of the Board, each of whom are independent, and disinterested.
The Special Committee evaluated and negotiated the terms and conditions (including the price) of the Proposed Transaction, including those set forth in that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) among the Company, Ribeye Parent, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Parent”), and Ribeye Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which, among other things, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company surviving the Merger. Parent and Merger Sub are affiliates of BDT.
On December 10, 2022, the Special Committee (i) determined that the Merger Agreement, and the transactions contemplated thereby (the “Transactions”), including the Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, were advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Company and the Company’s stockholders (excluding certain affiliates of BDT, including Byron D. Trott, BDT Capital Partners I-A Holdings, LLC, BDT WSP Holdings, LLC and BDT Family Holdings, LLC (collectively the “Specified Holders”) and their respective affiliates) and (ii) recommended that the Board (a) approve the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, and (b) recommend adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, to the Company’s stockholders.
On December 11, 2022, the Board, acting in reliance upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, were advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders (excluding the Specified Holders and their respective affiliates), (ii) approved the Merger Agreement, the execution and delivery by the Company of the Merger Agreement, the performance by the Company of its obligations contained therein and the consummation of the Transactions, including the Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions contained in the Merger Agreement and (iii) resolved to recommend adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, to the Company’s stockholders.
On December 11, 2022, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub entered into the Merger Agreement.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, each Class A Share that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares held by BDT Capital Partners I-A Holdings, LLC and BDT WSP Holdings, LLC, (ii) any Class A Shares or outstanding shares of Class B common stock (each, a “Class B Share,” collectively the “Class B Shares”) canceled pursuant to the Merger Agreement and (iii) any dissenting Class A Shares) will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $8.05 per Class A Share, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”). All of the Class A Shares held by BDT Capital Partners I-A Holdings, LLC and BDT WSP Holdings, LLC and all of the issued and outstanding Class B Shares will be converted into an equal number of Class A Shares and Class B Shares, respectively, of the surviving company and remain outstanding. Holders of Class B Shares and paired non-voting common interest units of Weber HoldCo LLC (“LLC Units”) will have the right pursuant to the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Weber HoldCo LLC (the “HoldCo LLC Agreement”), as amended by the First Amendment to the HoldCo LLC Agreement, to participate in the Merger by delivering a notice of participation on or prior to the date that is 11 days after the Company first files its preliminary Information Statement on Schedule 14C (the “Information Statement”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in connection with the Merger.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Class A Shares, award of restricted stock units with respect to Class A Shares (“Company RSU Award”) and limited liability interest designated as a “Profit Unit” in Weber HoldCo LLC, in each case, whether vested or unvested, will remain outstanding and continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as immediately prior to the Effective Time, as set forth in the applicable Company equity plan and award agreement, except that any Company RSU Award held by any director of the Company who is not an employee of the Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates (a “Director RSU Award”) will instead accelerate in full and be canceled, with the holder thereof being entitled to receive, in respect of such cancellation, without interest, an amount in cash equal to (i) the number of Shares subject to such Director RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration.

Our advertising appears in online display and connected and online TV, such as YouTube. We work with high-profile food, lifestyle and barbecue influencers worldwide as extensions of our brand and we use social media to further cultivate our Weber community and amplify the passion for our brand and products. We collect consumer data from a wide range of sources, including our connected devices, Weber apps, purchases on Weber.com, owner warranty registrations and Grill Academy classes, to tailor our marketing, offers and programs.
We collaborate with our retail partners to deliver an engaging and compelling Weber brand experience through custom fixtures, signage and product displays.

Our “Grill Masters”—a global team of Weber culinary experts with a deep expertise in grilling techniques and Weber products—participate in numerous annual events, doing in-person experiential events and virtual cooking demonstrations while also showcasing our products. In addition, we have a mobile grilling academy that does pop-up events at Do-It-Yourself and independent retailers across North America.
Product Innovation and Development
Consumers are at the center of our product innovation and development process. In recent years, we have significantly increased investment in product innovation and development to bring innovation to our existing product portfolio and facilitate entry into new product categories based on data driven consumer insight. Our product innovation and development team develops new products and enhances our existing product portfolio with an unwavering focus on improving consumers’ grilling experiences, encouraging them to grill more often and with more confidence. In 2021, we acquired June Life Inc., which augmented our software and hardware engineering capabilities.
Manufacturing and Distribution
We are the only major grill company that maintains a significant United States (“U.S.”) -based manufacturing footprint. We have a long standing history with a diversified set of suppliers, mainly within the U.S. and Asia, who send component parts to Huntley, Illinois for finished grill manufacturing. In addition to our U.S. manufacturing, we maintain long-standing relationships with three major grill manufacturers in China who provide us with flexibility and redundancy across our major project lines. All of our partners are required to operate according to our strict quality standards and in 
accordance with our supplier code of conduct. We enforce stringent product quality standards over our own manufacturing and that of our manufacturing partners. 
In October 2021, we opened our first European-based manufacturing and distribution hub in Zabrze, Poland. This location manufactures and distributes key product lines for the EMEA market. The strategic location of this facility has increased our manufacturing capacity, improved demand responsiveness in EMEA, reduced manufacturing and transportation costs and further diversified our global manufacturing footprint. This location was expanded during fiscal year 2022 for additional warehouse and distribution space.
Our Global Distribution Center in Huntley, Illinois serves as a central hub for shipments to our North American retail customers and plays a key role in our global hub and spoke distribution model. Globally, we occupy 22 distribution facilities, maintaining a hub and spoke approach to distribution. We use distribution partners to serve markets in EMEA and APAC to strengthen our network. This hybrid model allows us to control distribution of our product in markets where it is economically viable. We manage inventory through a disciplined, global sales and operations planning process that manages demand and supply dynamics in real-time.
Raw Materials
The primary raw materials used in our manufacturing facilities and those of our suppliers include aluminum, carbon steel, stainless steel, polypropylene and nylon. Many of these materials are available globally from multiple suppliers. In some cases, we will specify certain suppliers for key raw materials or components in order to maintain our quality standards. 
Competition
We compete in the large global outdoor cooking market. Competition in our markets is based on a number of factors including product quality, performance, durability, features and price, as well as brand image and recognition. Weber is the only outdoor cooking brand with significant global scale, operating a vertically integrated manufacturing platform with an omni-channel distribution network. As the largest global grilling brand, we compete against a variety of well-known and emerging brands based on fuel type and geography. While no other company offers the breadth of our product offering, our competitors, in certain categories, include Big Green Egg, Broil King, Campingaz, Char-Broil, Landmann, Napoleon, Nexgrill, Pit Boss, Traeger and Ziegler & Brown.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright and other intellectual property laws in the U.S. and similar laws in other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures, cybersecurity practices and contractual provisions and restrictions, to establish, maintain and protect the intellectual property and proprietary rights and our products and technology. As of September 30, 2022, we held approximately 195 issued U.S. patents, 759 issued foreign patents and 294 pending patent applications worldwide relating to our products, as well as approximately 91 registered U.S. trademarks, 486 registered foreign trademarks and 58 pending trademark applications worldwide covering our brands and products. In addition to the intellectual property rights that we own, we license certain technologies and intellectual property rights from third parties, some of which are incorporated into our products.
We have implemented an online marketplace monitoring and seller/listing termination program to disrupt any counterfeit or infringing offerings. We collaborate with Amazon and other online marketplaces to operate such termination programs. 
Seasonality
Although we generally have demand for our products throughout the year, our sales have historically experienced some seasonality. We have typically experienced our highest level of sales of our products in the second and third fiscal quarters as retailers across North America and Europe changeover their floor sets, build inventory and fulfill consumer demand for outdoor cooking products. Sales are typically lower during our first and fourth fiscal quarters, with the exception of our Australia/New Zealand business which is counter seasonal to the balance of our business. We have a long track record of investing in our business throughout the year, including in operating expenses, working capital, and other growth initiatives. While these investments drive performance during the primary selling season in our second and third fiscal quarters, they generally have a negative impact on cash flow and net (loss) income during our first and fourth fiscal quarters. Unfavorable weather during our higher sales season can also have a material adverse impact on our results, and can cause shifts in sales across fiscal quarters. 
Human Capital Resources
As of September 30, 2022, we had approximately 2,564 full-time employees, including 1,457 in global operations and supply chain and 497 in sales and marketing, with the remaining headcount supporting various business functions 
around the world. Of all of our full-time employees, 1,470 are located in the U.S. and 1,094 are located internationally. Approximately 22% of our employees are covered by collective labor agreements, all three of which were renewed in 2021. We have not experienced any significant union-related work stoppages over the last ten years. 
Employee Development. As part of our human capital resource objectives, we seek to attract, retain, develop and reward our employees through a variety of mechanisms. We build upon Weber’s objectives by seeking to attract, retain, develop and reward behaviors to ensure our long-term sustainability as a company. We continue to advance our efforts to develop a performance culture by strengthening performance management processes through management training and the development and implementation of consistent documentation and methodologies designed to ensure a robust process for all employees. We encourage performance discussions for all employees each year and establish clearly defined goals and incentive programs to drive employee performance in alignment with our overall business objectives. In addition, we have implemented a coordinated approach in managing our overall compensation structure and regularly conduct full evaluations of our compensation and incentive programs to ensure we are competitive in these areas. We monitor our performance by measuring numerous elements relating to our human capital management efforts.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ("DE&I"). Weber is focused on recruiting and retaining diverse employees, creating awareness of diversity issues, fostering a supportive, positive environment where inclusive behaviors are the norm, and embedding accountability for diversity throughout the organization. Our goal is to reflect the diversity of our consumers throughout our Company. We have taken action to make progress on our DE&I journey, and we are firmly committed to continuing to advance our DE&I priorities. Our focus on equity, diversity and inclusion enables us to build a culture where employees are inspired to share their passion, talents and ideas. Our five Employee Resource Groups, which include Weber Pride, Women of Weber, Weber African Ancestry Network, Weber Young Professionals and Weber Hispanic & Latino Heritage Network, also play a critical role in attracting diverse talent, providing mentoring and career development opportunities and connecting people to the Company and the communities where we do business.
Employee Engagement. We communicate frequently and transparently with our employees through a variety of engagement vehicles, including a global Employee Engagement Survey. This survey provides tools to leaders and employees to drive improvements globally.
Market-Based Compensation. We provide a market-based competitive compensation through our salary, annual incentive and long-term incentive programs, and a robust benefits package that promotes employee well-being across all aspects of their lives, including physical, financial, social and emotional well-being. Weber offers a comprehensive retiree medical plan for those who meet eligibility requirements. In addition, we provide a 401(k) plan for eligible employees in the U.S.
Health and Wellness. Creating a culture where all colleagues feel supported and valued is paramount to our corporate mission. We strive to ensure the health, safety and general well-being of our colleagues. We continue to evolve our programs to meet our colleagues’ health and wellness needs, which we believe is essential to attract and retain employees of the highest caliber, and we offer a competitive benefits package focused on fostering work/life integration.
Company Ethics. The Company has processes in place for compliance with the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Weber employees, requiring employees to disclose actual or potential conflicts of interest, report actual or potential violations of the law, rules, regulations, ethics or the Code policy and acknowledge their obligation to comply with the applicable code. Ethics are deeply embedded in our values and business processes. Respect and Responsibility is a core Company value and is the anchor for our Code of Business Conduct. The Company regularly re-enforces our commitment to ethics and integrity in employee communications, in our everyday actions and through our processes. In addition, the Company provides targeted training across the globe during the course of the of the year. The Company also maintains an ethics related hotline, managed by a third party, through which individuals can anonymously raise concerns or ask questions about business behavior.
Government Regulations
We are subject to many varying laws and regulations in the U.S., the European Union, the United Kingdom, and throughout the world, including those related to privacy, data protection, intellectual property, consumer protection, e-commerce, marketing, advertising, messaging, rights of publicity, health and safety, employment and labor, product liability, accessibility, competition and taxation. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created or amended in a manner that could harm our current or future business and operations. In addition, it is possible that certain governments may seek to block or limit our products and services or otherwise impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility or usability of any or all of our products and services for an extended period of time or indefinitely.
We are also subject to laws regulating consumer products in the jurisdictions in which we sell our products. In the U.S. for instance, certain of our products are subject to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Act, under which the U.S. 
Consumer Product Safety Commission may exclude products from the market that are found to be unsafe or hazardous, require repair, replacement or refund of products, impose fines for noncompliance with requirements and impose fines for failure to timely notify them of potential safety hazards.
Environmental Matters
Our properties and operations are subject to a number of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, air emissions, water discharges, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes, soil and groundwater contamination, employee health and safety and the chemical content of products. Under certain of these laws and regulations, we may be subject to joint and several liability for environmental investigations and cleanups, including at properties that we currently or previously owned or operated, or at sites at which waste we generated was disposed, even if the contamination was not caused by us or was legal at the time it occurred. We are not a party to any material proceedings arising under these regulations. We believe that compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will not materially affect our consolidated financial condition or our competitive position.
Available Information
Our reports filed with or furnished to the SEC pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“the Exchange Act”), are available, free of charge, on our Investor Relations website at https://investors.weber.com as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.
