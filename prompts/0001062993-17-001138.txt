ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Corporate Overview 
 Orgenesis Inc. is among the first of a new breed of regenerative therapy companies with expertise and unique experience in cell therapy development and manufacturing. We are a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company focused not only on developing our trans-differentiation technologies for diabetes and vertically integrating manufacturing that can optimize our abilities to scale-up our technologies for clinical trials and eventual commercialization, but also to apply our disciplined execution to emerging technologies of other cell therapy markets in such areas as cell-based cancer immunotherapies and neurodegenerative diseases. This integrated approach supports our business philosophy of bringing to market significant life-improving medical treatments. 
 Our cell therapy technology for diabetes derives from published work of Prof. Sarah Ferber, our Chief Science Officer and a researcher at Tel Hashomer Medical Center, a leading medical hospital and research center in Israel (THM), who established a proof of concept that demonstrates the capacity to induce a shift in the developmental fate of cells from the liver and transdifferentiating (converting) them into pancreatic beta cell-like insulin-producing cells. Furthermore, those cells were found to be resistant to autoimmune attack and to produce insulin in a glucose-sensitive manner in relevant animal models. Our development activities with respect to cell-derived and related therapies, which are conducted through Orgenesis Ltd., our Israeli subsidiary, have, to date, been limited to laboratory and preclinical testing. Our development plan calls for conducting additional preclinical safety and efficacy studies with respect to diabetes and other potential indications. 
 Our Belgian-based subsidiary, MaSTherCell SA, is a contract development manufacturing organization, or CDMO, specialized in cell therapy development for advanced medicinal products. In the last decade, cell therapy and regenerative medicine products have gained significant importance, particularly in the fields of ex-vivo gene therapy and immunotherapy. While academic and industrial research has led scientific development in the sector, industrialization and manufacturing expertise remains insufficient. MaSTherCell plans to fill this gap by providing two types of services to its customers: (i) process and assay development and optimization services and (ii) current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) contract manufacturing services. These services offer a double advantage to MaSTherCell's customers. First, customers can continue allocating their financial and human resources on their product/therapy, while relying on a trusted partner for their process development/production. Second, it allows customers to leverage MaSTherCell's expertise in cell therapy manufacturing and all related aspects. As the industry continues to mature and a growing number of cell therapy companies approach commercialization, we believe that MaSTherCell is well positioned to serve as an external manufacturing source for cell therapy companies. 
 In furtherance of our business strategy, we are leveraging the recognized expertise and experience in cell process development and manufacturing of MaSTherCell, and our international joint ventures, to build a global and fully integrated bio-pharmaceutical company in the cell therapy development and manufacturing area. We target the international manufacturing market as a key priority through joint-venture agreements that provide development capabilities, along with manufacturing facilities and experienced staff. All of these capabilities offered to third-parties are mobilized for our internal development projects, allowing the Compamy to be in a position to bring new products to the patients faster and at a fraction of the costs. 
 We need to raise significant capital in order to realize our business plan. See Risk Factors. 
 Cell Therapy and Regenerative Medicine Field 
 Regenerative medicine is the process of replacing or regenerating human cells, tissues or organs to restore normal function. Our business model is focused on two of these areas  manufacturing and treating patients. 
 -4-

First, through our wholly-owned CDMO subsidiary, MaSTherCell, we have built a unique and fundamental base platform of know-how and expertise for a multitude of cell types. MaSTherCell has strategically positioned us in the cell therapy market on multiple levels as the cell therapy industry continues to evolve. Our goal is to maintain our reputation as a premier service provider in the regenerative medicine industry by leveraging the experience and expertise of MaSTherCell as a recognized leader of cell therapy development and manufacturing. 
 Second, on our clinical development side, through our Israeli subsidiary, our goal is to advance a unique cell-based therapy, the Autologous Insulin Producing (AIP) cells, into clinical development. AIP cells utilize the technology of cellular trans-differentiation to transform an autologous adult liver cell into a fully functional and physiologically glucose-responsive insulin producing cell. Treatment with AIP cells is expected to provide Type 1 Diabetes patients with long-term insulin independence. Because the AIP cells are autologous, this benefit should be achieved and maintained without the need for concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. 
 Cell therapy is the prevention or treatment of human disease by the administration of cells that have been selected, multiplied and manipulated outside the body (ex vivo). To date, the most common type of cell therapy has been the replacement of mature, functioning cells through blood and platelet transfusions. Since the 1970s, first bone marrow and then blood and umbilical cord-derived stem cells have been used to restore bone marrow, as well as blood and immune system cells damaged by chemotherapy and radiation used to treat many cancers. These types of cell therapies are standard of practice world-wide and are typically reimbursed by insurance. 
 Within the field of cell therapy, research and development using stem cells to treat a host of diseases and conditions has greatly expanded. All living complex organisms start as a single cell that replicates, differentiates (matures) and perpetuates in an adult organism throughout its lifetime. Stem cells (in either embryonic or adult forms) are primitive and undifferentiated cells that have the unique ability to transform into or otherwise affect many different cells, such as white blood cells, nerve cells or heart muscle cells. Our cell therapy development efforts do not use stem cells, but rather are focused on the use of fully mature, adult cells; for our purposes in the treatment of diabetes, our cells are derived from the liver or other adult tissue and are transdifferentiated to become adult AIP cells. 
 There are two general classes of cell therapies: allogeneic and autologous. In allogeneic procedures, cells collected from a person (the donor) are transplanted into, or used to develop a treatment for another patient (the recipient) with or without modification. In cases where the donor and the recipient are the same individual, these procedures are referred to as autologous. Our treatment for diabetes focuses on autologous cells that offer a low likelihood of rejection by the patient. We believe the long-term benefits of this treatment can best be achieved with an autologous product. 
 Various cell therapies are in clinical development for an array of human diseases, including autoimmune, oncologic, neurologic and orthopedic diseases, among other indications. Orgenesis, as well as other companies, are developing cell therapies that are designed to address cancers, ischemic repair and immune modulation. While no assurances can be given regarding future medical developments, we believe that the field of cell therapy holds the promise to address several medical conditions and minimize or ameliorate the pain and suffering from many common diseases and/or from the process of aging. 
 Diabetes Mellitus (DM), or simply diabetes, is a metabolic disorder usually caused by a combination of hereditary and environmental factors, and results in abnormally high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia). Diabetes occurs as a result of impaired insulin production by the pancreatic islet cells. The most common types of the disease are Type-1 Diabetes (T1D) and Type-2 Diabetes (T2D). In T1D, the onset of the disease follows an autoimmune attack of β-cells that severely reduces β-cell mass. T1D usually has an early onset and is sometimes also called juvenile diabetes. In T2D, the pathogenesis involves insulin resistance, insulin deficiency and enhanced gluconeogenesis, while late progression stages eventually lead to β-cell failure and a significant reduction in β-cell function and mass. T2D often occurs later in life and is sometimes called adult onset diabetes. Both T1D and late-stage T2D result in marked hypoinsulinemia, reduction in β-cell function and mass and lead to severe secondary complications, such as myocardial infarcts, limb amputations, neuropathies and nephropathies and even death. In both cases, patients become insulin-dependent, requiring either multiple insulin injections per day or reliance on an insulin pump.

Diabetes is one of the most challenging health problems in the 21st century, incurring staggering health, societal, and economic impact. Diabetes is currently the fourth or fifth leading cause of death in most developed countries. Diabetic has been declared an epidemic in many developing and newly industrialized nations. 
 Threats from Pancreas Islet Transplantation and Cell Therapies 
 For some patients with severe and difficult to control diabetes (hypoglycemic unawareness), islet transplants are considered. Pancreatic islets are the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. Scientists use enzymes to isolate the islets from the pancreas of a deceased donor. Because the islets are fragile, transplantation must occur soon after they are removed. Typically, a patient receives at least 10,000 islet equivalents per kilogram of body weight, extracted from pancreases obtained from different donors. Patients often require two separate transplants to achieve insulin independence. 
 Transplants are often performed by an interventional radiologist, who uses x-rays and ultrasound to guide placement of a catheter - a small plastic tube - through the upper abdomen and into the portal vein of the liver. The islets are then infused slowly through the catheter into the liver. The patient receives a local anesthetic and a sedative. In some cases, a surgeon may perform the transplant through a small incision, using general anesthesia. 
 Because the islets are obtained from cadavers that are unrelated to the patient, the patient needs to be treated with drugs that inhibit the immune response so that the patient doesnt reject the transplant. In the early days of islet transplantation, the drugs were so powerful that they actually were toxic to the islets; improvements in the procedure are widely used and are now referred to as the Edomonton Protocol. 
 Studies and Reports 
 Since reporting their findings in the June 2000 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, have continued to use and refine Edmonton Protocol to transplant pancreatic islets into selected patients with T1D that is difficult to control. 
 In 2005, the researchers published 5-year follow-up results for 65 patients who received transplants at their center and reported that about 10 percent of the patients remained free of the need for insulin injections at 5-year follow-up. Most recipients returned to using insulin because the transplanted islets lost their ability to function over time, potentially due to the immune suppression protocol, which prevents the immune rejection of the implanted cells. The researchers noted, however, that many transplant recipients were able to reduce their need for insulin, achieve better glucose stability, and reduce problems with hypoglycemia, also called low blood sugar level. 
 In its 2006 annual report, the Collaborative Islet Transplant Registry, which is funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, presented data from 23 islet transplant programs on 225 patients who received islet transplants between 1999 and 2005. According to the report, nearly two-thirds of recipients achieved insulin independence - defined as being able to stop insulin injections for at least 14 days - during the year following transplantation. However, other data from the report showed that insulin independence is difficult to maintain over time. Six months after their last infusion of islets, more than half of recipients were free of the need for insulin injections, but at 2-year follow-up, the proportion dropped to about one-third of recipients. The report described other benefits of islet transplantation, including reduced need for insulin among recipients who still needed insulin, improved blood glucose control, and greatly reduced risk of episodes of severe hypoglycemia. 
 -6-

In a 2006 report of the Immune Tolerance Networks international islet transplantation study, researchers emphasized the value of transplantation in reversing a condition known as hypoglycemia unawareness. People with hypoglycemia unawareness are vulnerable to dangerous episodes of severe hypoglycemia because they are not able to recognize that their blood glucose levels are too low. The study showed that even partial islet function after transplant can eliminate hypoglycemia unawareness. 
 Pancreatic islet transplantation (cadaver donors) is an allogeneic transplant, and, as in all allogeneic transplantations, there is a risk for graft rejection and patients must receive lifelong immune suppressants. Though this technology has shown good results clinically, there are several setbacks, such as patients being sensitive to recurrent T1D autoimmune attacks and a shortage in tissues available for islet cells transplantation.

Our Solution 
 We are developing and bringing to the clinical stage a technology that is based on the published work of Prof. Sarah Ferber, our Chief Science Officer and a researcher at THM, demonstrated the capacity to induce a shift in the developmental fate of cells from the liver into pancreatic beta cell-like insulin-producing cells. Furthermore, those cells were found to be resistant to the autoimmune attack and to produce insulin in a glucose-sensitive manner.
The License Agreement 
 Our cell therapy business derives from a licensing agreement entered into as of February 2, 2012 by Orgenesis Ltd., our Israeli subsidiary, and THM pursuant to which our Israeli subsidiary was granted a worldwide royalty bearing and exclusive license to certain information regarding a molecular and cellular approach directed at converting liver cells into functional insulin producing cells as a treatment for diabetes (the License Agreement). By using therapeutic agents (i.e., PDX-1, and additional pancreatic transcription factors in an adenovirus-vector) that efficiently convert a sub-population of liver cells into pancreatic islets phenotype and function, this approach allows the diabetic patient to be the donor of his own therapeutic tissue. We believe that this provides major competitive advantage to the cell transformation technology of our Israeli Subsidiary.
 As consideration for the license, our Israeli subsidiary has agreed to pay the following to THM: 
 
1) | A royalty of 3.5% of net sales; 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | 16% of all sublicensing fees received; 
3) | An annual license fee of $15,000, which commenced on January 1, 2012 and is due once every year thereafter (the Annual Fee). The Annual Fee is non-refundable, but it shall be credited each year due, against the royalty noted above, to the extent that such are payable, during that year; and 
4) | Milestone payments as follows: 


a) | $50,000 on the date of initiation of phase I clinical trials in human subjects; 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
b) | $50,000 on the date of initiation of phase II clinical trials in human subjects; 
c) | $150,000 on the date of initiation of phase III clinical trials in human subjects; 
d) | $750,000 on the date of initiation of issuance of an approval for marketing of the first product by the FDA; and 
e) | $2,000,000, when worldwide net sales of products have reached the amount of $150,000,000 for the first time, (The Sales Milestone). 

 As of November 30, 2016, our Israeli subsidiary has not reached any of these milestones. 
 In the event of an acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding share capital of the Israeli Subsidiary or of the Company and/or consolidation of the Israeli Subsidiary or the Company into or with another corporation (Exit), under the License Agreement, THM is entitled to elect, at its sole option, whether to receive from the Company a one-time payment based, as applicable, on the value at the time of the Exit of either 5,563,809 shares of common stock of the Company or the value of 1,000 ordinary shares of the Israeli subsidiary at the time of the Exit. If THM elects to receive the consideration as a result of an Exit, the royalty payments will cease.
 If THM elects to not receive any consideration as a result of an Exit, THM is entitled under the License Agreement to continue to receive all the rights and consideration it is entitled to pursuant to the License Agreement (including, without limitation, the exercise of the rights pursuant to future Exit events), and any agreement relating to an Exit event shall be subject to the surviving entitys and/or the purchasers undertaking towards THM to perform all of the Israeli subsidiary's obligations pursuant to the License Agreement. 
 The Israeli subsidiary agreed to submit to THM a commercially reasonable plan which shall include all research and development activities as required for the development and manufacture of the products, including preclinical and clinical activities until an FDA or any other equivalent regulatory authoritys approval for marketing and including all regulatory procedures required to obtain such approval for each product candidate (a Development Plan), within 18 months from the date of the License Agreement. Under the License agreement, the Israeli Subsidiary undertook to develop, manufacture, sell and market the products pursuant to the milestones and time-frame schedule specified in the Development Plan. The Israeli Subsidiary submitted the Development Plan in May 2014.

Under the License Agreement, THM is entitled to terminate the License Agreement under certain conditions relating to a material change in the business of our Israeli subsidiary or a breach of any material obligation thereunder or to a bankruptcy event of our Israeli subsidiary. Under certain conditions, our Israeli subsidiary may terminate the License Agreement and return the licensed information to THM. 
 In May 2015, the Israeli Subsidiary entered into a research service agreement with the Licensor. According to the agreement, our Israeli Subsidiary will perform a study at the facilities and use the equipment and personnel of the Sheba Medical Center, for the consideration of approximately $110 thousand for a year. In May 2016, the Israeli Subsidiary renewed the research agreement for an additional year with annual consideration of approximately $88 thousand. 
 Subject to raising the necessary funding, we intend to advance our cell therapy business by furthering this licensed technology to a clinical stage. We intend to devote significant resources to process development and manufacturing in order to optimize the safety and efficacy of our future product candidates, as well as our cost of goods and time to market. Our goal is to carefully manage our fixed cost structure, maximize optionality, and drive long-term cost of goods as low as possible. We believe that operating our own manufacturing facility will provide the Company with enhanced control of material supply for both clinical trials and the commercial market, will enable the more rapid implementation of process changes, and will allow for better long-term margins. 
 Toward this goal, we are working to advance a unique product that combines cell-based therapy and regenerative medicine, (AIP) cells, into clinical development. AIP cells utilize the technology of cellular trans-differentiation to transform an autologous adult liver cell into an adult, fully functional and physiologically glucose-responsive pancreatic-like insulin producing cell. Treatment with AIP cells is expected to provide Diabetes patients with long-term insulin independence. Because the AIP cells are autologous, this benefit should be achieved and maintained without the need for concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. The procedure to generate AIP cells begins with liver tissue accessed via needle biopsy from a patient. The liver tissue is then sent to a central facility where biopsied liver cells are isolated, expanded and trans-differentiated into AIP cells. The final product is a solution of AIP cells, which are packaged in an infusion bag and sent back to the patients treating physician where the cells are transplanted back into the patients liver via portal vein infusion. The entire process, from biopsy to transplantation, is expected to take 5-6 weeks. 
 
Unique benefits of AIP cells 
 -9-

We believe that our singular focus on the acquisition, development, and commercialization of AIP cells may have many and meaningful benefits over other technologies, including: 
 
 | Physiologically glucose-responsive insulin production within one week of AIP cell transplantation; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Insulin-independence within one month; 
 | Single course of therapy (~10-year insulin-independence); 
 | No need for concomitant immunosuppressive therapy; 
 | Return to (near) normal quality of life for patients; 
 | Single liver biopsy supplies unlimited source of therapeutic tissue (bio-banking for future use if needed); 
 | Highly controlled and tightly closed GMP systems; and 
 | Quality Control of final product upon release and distribution 

 We are aware of no other company focused on development of AIP cells based on transdifferentiation. The pharmaceutical industry is fragmented and it is a competitive market. We compete with many pharmaceutical companies, both large and small and there may be technologies in development of which we are not aware. 
 Marketing 
 Our plan is to market and sell AIP cellular therapy as a stand-alone product, and to provide supporting education and services to physicians and the healthcare providers that support them. In addition, we expect to provide appropriate and supportive services to the distribution networks that make our product available to treating physicians and facilities. Once marketing authorization is granted, we plan to market our product in the North American, European and Asian regions. 
 As part of our long-term strategy, we will consider clinical development and commercialization collaborations and/or partnerships with international companies involved in the diabetes therapeutic area. Currently, leading companies in this field include Novo Nordisk, Takeda Pharmaceutical, Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi Aventis and Merck. 
 Future Product Candidates 
 Currently, liver cells are best suited for generating AIP cells. Future products may involve the use of cell types other than liver that are more easily accessible from the diabetic patient or from unrelated donors. Additionally, other adult cells (i.e. fibroblasts) may be studied for trans-differentiation into functional cells in diseases other than insulin-dependent disorders (i.e. neurodegenerative). 
Competition 
 Insulin therapy is used for Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM) patients who are not controlled with oral medications, although this therapy has well-known and well-characterized disadvantages. Weight gain is a common side effect of insulin therapy, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Injection of insulin causes pain and inconvenience for patients. Patient compliance and inconvenience of self-administering multiple daily insulin injections is also considered a disadvantage of this therapy. The most serious adverse effect of insulin therapy is hypoglycemia. 
 The global diabetes market comprising the insulin, insulin analogues and other anti-diabetic drugs has been evolving rapidly. Todays overall diabetes market is dominated by a handful of participants such as Novo Nordisk A/S, Eli Lilly and Company, Sanofi-Aventis, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Pfizer Inc., Merck KgaA, and Bayer AG. 
 Collaboration Agreements Relating to the Diabetes Business 
 In order to develop our cell therapy business, we have embarked on a strategy of collaborative arrangement with strategically situated third parties around the world. We believe that these parties have the expertise, experience and strategic location to advance our clinical development business.

Russia
On November 12, 2015, our Israeli subsidiary entered into a collaboration agreement with Biosequel LLC, a company incorporated and existing under the laws of Russia (Biosequel), to collaborate in carrying out clinical trials and eventually marketing the Companys products in Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. The collaboration is divided into two stages, with the first focused on obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals for conducting clinical trials, as well as performing all clinical and other testing required for market authorization in the defined territory. The second stage will focus on marketing the products in the territory and will be subject to obtaining requisite approvals for such marketing. Biosequel will fund the costs for the first stage, which is expected to last for five or more years, but such stage may terminate earlier if the necessary regulatory approvals for commencement of clinical trials are not obtained by the second anniversary of the agreement or if the malting approvals are not obtained with 48 months following the commencement of the clinical trials. The collaboration agreement is also terminable under certain limited conditions relating to a partys insolvency or bankruptcy related event or breach of a material term of the agreement and force majeure events or upon the termination of the THM License Agreement. As of the date of this report, Biosequel is in the first stage of the collaboration and performing the work needed in order to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for conducting clinical trials. 
 China, China, Hong Kong SAR and Macau SAR
On February 18, 2016, our Israeli subsidiary entered into a Collaboration Agreement (the Collaboration Agreement) with Grand China Energy Group Limited with headquarters in Beijing, China (Grand China) to collaborate in carrying out clinical trials and marketing the Companys autologous insulin producing cell therapy product in the Peoples Republic of China, Hong Kong and Macau, based on achieving certain pre-market development milestones that include Grand China obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals for commercialization of our AIP cells, including performing all clinical and other testing required for market authorization in each jurisdiction in the territory. Upon achieving the pre-market development milestones by Grand China, the parties will collaborate on marketing the products in the territory. Grand China will bear all costs associated with the pre-marketing development efforts in the territory, which is expected to last for approximately four years. Subject to the completion of the pre-marketing development milestones, our Israeli Subsidiary has agreed to grant to Grand China, or a fully owned subsidiary thereof, under a separate sub-license agreement, an exclusive sub-license to the intellectual property underlying solely for commercialization of the Companys products in each such jurisdiction in the territory where all of the pre-marketing development required to commercialize the AIP cells have been successfully completed by Grand China. Grand China has agreed to pay annual license fees, ongoing royalties based on net sales generated by Grand China and its sublicensees, milestone payments and sublicense fees. 
Research and Development Expenditures 
 We incurred $2,637 thousand in research and development expenditures in the last fiscal year ended November 30, 2016, of which $480 thousand was covered by grant funding ($1,860 thousand for the year ended November 30, 2015, of which $793 thousand was covered by grant funding). 
Contract Development and Manufacturing Business 
 Our Belgian-based subsidiary, MaSTherCell, is a CDMO specialized in cell therapy development for advanced therapeutical products. In the last decade, cell therapy medicinal products have gained significant importance, particularly in the fields of ex-vivo gene therapy and immunotherapy. While academic and industrial research has led scientific development in the sector, industrialization and manufacturing expertise remains insufficient. MaSTherCell plans to fill this gap by providing two types of services to its customers: (i) process and assay development services and (ii) current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) contract manufacturing services. These services offer a double advantage to MaSTherCell's customers. First, customers can continue allocating their financial and human resources on their product/therapy, while relying on a trusted partner for their process development/production. Second, it allows customers to benefit from MaSTherCell's expertise in cell therapy manufacturing and all related aspects. 
 MaSTherCell's target customers are primarily cell therapy companies that are in pre- or early-stage clinical trials (Phase I/II). MaSTherCell has continued to invest in its manufacturing capabilities to offer a one-stop-shop service to its customers from pre-clinical up to commercial. This stems from the finding that these companies' processes have to be set up right from the start in order for them to obtain approved products that have the simplest possible process and with the lowest possible cost of goods sold (COGS). MaSTherCell continues to invest resources to maintain best practices in quality service, quality control, quality assurance and permanent staff training to uphold the highest standards. Therefore, MaSTherCell's strategy is to build long term relationships with its customers in order to help them bring highly potent cell therapy products faster to the market and in cost-effective ways. To provide these services, MaSTherCell relies on a team of dedicated experts both from academic and industry backgrounds. It operates through state-of-the-art facilities located just 40 minutes from Brussels, which have received the final cGMP manufacturing authorization from the Belgian Drug Agency (AFMPS) in September 2013. 
 -11-

We devote significant resources to process development and manufacturing in order to optimize the safety and efficacy of our future product candidates for our customers, as well as our cost of goods and time to market. Our goal is to carefully manage our fixed cost structure, maximize optionality, and drive long-term cost of goods as low as possible. We believe that operating our own manufacturing facility provides us with enhanced control of material supply for both clinical trials and the commercial market, will enable the more rapid implementation of process changes, and will allow for better long-term margins. 
 The Company believes that the combination of growing recurring revenue and profits through its manufacturing activities and the commercialization of its Type 1 diabetes therapies is the de-risked, value-driving factor of the business. 
 
Joint Ventures in the CDMO Field 
 We have established collaboration agreement for the CDMO activity and the main focus, initially, has been Asia (Korea, Singapore and India) and Israel. We are leveraging the experience and expertise of MaSTherCell to build out a global network of CDMO centers. 
 Korea
-12-

On March 14, 2016, we entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (the JVA) with CureCell pursuant to which we are collaborating in the contract development and manufacturing of cell therapy products in Korea. From the execution date of the JVA until the date of the filing of this report on Form 10-K, CureCell has procured the GMP facility and has recruited the appropriate staff in Korea. Under the JVA, the Company and CureCell each undertook to remit, within two years of the execution of the JVA, $2 million to the JV Company, of which $1 million is to be in cash and the balance in an in-kind investment, the scope and valuation of which shall be preapproved in writing. Through the date of the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K, we remitted to CureCell $595 thousand by way of a convertible loan. Our intention by the obligation of the agreement is to pursue the joint venture through a newly established Korean company (the JV Company) in which each party will have 50% from the participating interest of the JV Company subject to the fulfillment by each party of his obligations under the JVA. In addition to that, the JVA provides that, under certain specified conditions, we can require CureCell to sell to us its participating (including equity) interest in the JV Company in consideration for the issuance of the Companys common stock based on the then valuation of the JV Company. As of November 30, 2016, the obligations of each party under the JVA have not been fulfilled and we are working on establishing the new JV Company. 
 Israel
On May 10, 2016, we and Atvio Biotech Ltd., an Israeli company (“Atvio”) entered into a joint venture agreement pursuant to which the parties are collaborating in the contract development and manufacturing of cell and virus therapy products in the field of regenerative medicine in the State of Israel. The parties are pursuing the joint venture through Atvio, in which we are holding a 50% participating interest therein, with the remaining 50% participating interest are being held by the other shareholders of Atvio. Up to the current date, Atvio has procured, at its sole expense, a GMP facility and has been recruited 4 employees in Israel. Subject to the work plan that was approved by Atvio and us, we will remit to Atvio a total of $1 million to defray the costs associated with the setting up and the maintenance of the GMP facility, all or part of which may be contributed by way of in kind services as agreed to in the work plan. The Company’s funding is made by way of a convertible loan to Atvio, which shall be convertible at our option at any time into 50% of the then outstanding equity capital immediately following such conversion. The joint venture agreement provides that, under certain specified conditions, either we can require the Atvio Shareholders to sell to us their participating (including equity) interest in Atvio or the Atvio Shareholders can require from us to purchase their respective participating and equity holdings in Atvio, in each case in consideration for the issuance of our common stock based on the then specified valuation of Atvio. As of November 30, 2016, we have remitted to Atvio a total of $111 thousand, under and subject to the terms of the joint venture agreement. 
 Competition in the CDMO Field 
 MaSTherCell competes with a number of companies both directly and indirectly. Key competitors include the following CMOs and CDMOs: Lonza Group Ltd, Progenitor Cell Therapy (PCT) LLC, Pharmacell BV, WuxiAppTec (WuXi PharmaTech (Cayman) Inc.), Cognate Bioservices Inc., Apceth GmbH & Co. KG, Eufets GmbH, Fraunhofer Gesellschaft, Cellforcure SASU, Cell Therapy Catapult Limited and Molmed S.p.A. MaSTherCell's services differ from these companies in two major aspects: 
 
 | Quality and expertise of its services: Clients identify the excellence of its facility, quality system, and people as a major differentiating point compared to competitors; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Flexible and tailored approach: MaSTherCell's philosophy is to build a true partnership with its clients and adapt itself to the clients needs, which entails no off-the-shelf process nor in-house technology platform, but a dedicated person in plant (of client), joint steering committees on each project and dedicated project managers. 

 MaSTherCell strengthens its leading position investing in a one-stop-shop service offering from pre-clinical to commercial with a clear focus on COGS of manufacturing processes. Neither of these differentiating points results in a price premium compared to other CMOs as MaSTherCell operates with a lean organization focused solely on cell therapy. 
 -13-

Finally, MaSTherCell is the only CDMO located in Belgium which logistically offers an ideal location given the high concentration of companies active in cell therapy (potential clients and companies with complementary know-how, products and services).

Intellectual Property 
 We will be able to protect our technology and products from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent it is covered by valid and enforceable patents or is effectively maintained as trade secrets. Patents and other proprietary rights are thus an essential element of our business. 
 Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology, and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing it proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
 We own or have exclusive rights to four (4) United States and seven (7) foreign issued patents, three (2) pending applications in the United States, eleven (11) pending applications in foreign jurisdictions: Europe, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Eurasia, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, and Singapore, and one (1) international PCT patent application, relating to the transdifferentiation of cells (including hepatic cells) to cells having pancreatic β-cell phenotype and function, and their use in the treatment of degenerative pancreatic disorders including diabetes, pancreatic cancer, and pancreatitis.
 Granted United States patents which are directed to methods of making transdifferentiated cells will expire between 2021 and 2024, excluding any patent term extensions that might be available following the grant of marketing authorizations. Granted patents outside of the United States directed to making transdifferentiated cells and their uses will expire between 2020 and 2024. We have pending patent applications for methods of making our product, the product itself, and methods of using the product that, if issued, would expire in the United States and in countries outside of the United States between 2034 and 2035, excluding any patent term adjustment that might be available following the grant of the patent and any patent term extensions that might be available following the grant of marketing authorizations. These pending patent applications are directed to the following specific compositions and methods: a method of producing a transdifferentiated population of cells, a population of transdifferentiated cells, a method of treating a degenerative pancreatic disorder in a subject in need, a method of isolating a population of cells that have an enriched capacity for transcription factor induced transdifferentiation, an isolated population of cells having enriched transdifferentiation capacity, a method of increasing transdifferentiation efficiency in a population of cells, a population of liver cells enriched for cells predisposed to transdifferentiation, and a method of manufacturing a population of human insulin producing cells and the population of cells produced by the recited manufacturing method.
 Government Regulation 
 We have not sought approval from the FDA for the AIP cells. Among all forms of cell therapy modalities, we believe that autologous cell replacement therapy seems to be of the highest benefit. We believe that it seems to be safer than other options as it does not alter the host genome but only alters the set of expressed epigenetic information that seems to be highly specific to the reprogramming protocol. It provides an abundant source of therapeutic tissue, which is not rejected by the patient and does not have to be treated by immune suppressants. It is highly ethical since no human organ donations or embryo-derived cells are needed. The proposed therapeutic approach does not require cell bio-banking at birth, which is both expensive and cannot be used for patients born prior to 2000. 
 Over the past decade, many studies published in leading scientific journals confirmed the capacity of reprogramming adult cells from many of our mature organs to either alternate organs or to stem like cells. Most widely used autologous cell replacement protocols are used for autologous implantation of bone marrow stem cells. This protocol is widely used in patients undergoing a massive chemotherapy session that destroys their bone marrow cells. However, the stem cells used for cancer patients delineated above do not require extensive manipulation and is regarded by FDA as minimally manipulated. 
 An additional autologous cell therapy approach already used in man is autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI). In the United States, Genzyme Corporation provides the only FDA approved ACI treatment: Carticel. The Carticel treatment is designated for young, healthy patients with medium to large sized damage to cartilage. During an initial procedure, the patients own chondrocytes are removed arthroscopically from a non-load-bearing area from either the intercondylar notch or the superior ridge of the medial or lateral femoral condyles.

To aid us in our efforts to achieve the highest level of compliance with FDA requirements, we have looked to hire experts in the field of pharmaceutical compliance. 
 Regulatory Process in the United States 
 Our product is subject to regulation as a biological product under the Public Health Service Act and the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. FDA generally requires the following steps for pre-market approval or licensure of a new biological product: 
 
 | Pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests conducted in compliance with the Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, requirements to assess a drugs biological activity and to identify potential safety problems, and to characterize and document the products chemistry, manufacturing controls, formulation, and stability; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Submission to FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND application, which must become effective before clinical testing in humans can start; 
 | Obtaining approval of Institutional Review Boards, or IRBs, of research institutions or other clinical sites to introduce a first human biologic drug candidate into humans in clinical trials; 
 | Conducting adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its intended indication conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP requirements; 
 | Compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) regulations and standards; 
 | Submission to FDA of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for marketing that includes adequate results of pre-clinical testing and clinical trials; 
 | FDA reviews the marketing application in order to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe, effective and potent for its intended uses; and 
 | Obtaining FDA approval of the BLA, including inspection and approval of the product manufacturing facility as compliant with cGMP requirements, prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the pharmaceutical agent. FDA may also require post marketing testing and surveillance of approved products, or place other conditions on the approvals. 

Regulatory Process in Europe 
 The European Union (EU) has approved a regulation specific to cell and tissue therapy product, the Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product (ATMP) regulation. For products such as our AIP that are regulated as an ATMP, the EU Directive requires: 

 | Compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP regulations and standards, pre-clinical laboratory and animal testing; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Filing a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) with the various member states or a centralized procedure; Voluntary Harmonization Procedure (VHP), a procedure which makes it possible to obtain a coordinated assessment of an application for a clinical trial that is to take place in several European countries; 
 | Obtaining approval of Ethic Committees of research institutions or other clinical sites to introduce the AIP into humans in clinical trials; 
 | Adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its intended use; and 
 | Submission to EMEA for a Marketing Authorization (MA); Review and approval of the MAA (Marketing Authorization Application). 

Clinical Trials 
 Typically, both in the U.S. and the European Union, clinical testing involves a three-phase process, although the phases may overlap. In Phase I, clinical trials are conducted with a small number of healthy volunteers or patients and are designed to provide information about product safety and to evaluate the pattern of drug distribution and metabolism within the body. In Phase II, clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. In some cases, an initial trial is conducted in diseased patients to assess both preliminary efficacy and preliminary safety and patterns of drug metabolism and distribution, in which case it is referred to as a Phase I/II trial. Phase III clinical trials are generally large-scale, multi-center, comparative trials conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide statistically valid proof of efficacy, as well as safety and potency. In some circumstances, FDA or EMA may require Phase IV or post-marketing trials if it feels that additional information needs to be collected about the drug after it is on the market. During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, as well as clinical trial investigators. An agency may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate the testing based upon the data that have been accumulated to that point and its assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the patient. Monitoring all aspects of the study to minimize risks is a continuing process. All adverse events must be reported to the FDA or EMA.
