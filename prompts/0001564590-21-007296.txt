Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 We are a pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of best-in-class therapeutics that improve and extend the lives of patients with cancer. Our initial focus is on the development of tesetaxel, an investigational, orally administered chemotherapy agent that belongs to a class of drugs known as taxanes, which are widely used in the treatment of cancer. Tesetaxel has several properties that make it unique among taxanes, including:

• | oral administration with a low pill burden;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | a long (~8-day) terminal plasma half-life (“t1/2”) in humans, enabling the maintenance of adequate drug levels with relatively infrequent dosing;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | no history of hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | significant activity against chemotherapy-resistant tumors.
--+------------------------------------------------------------

 In patients with metastatic breast cancer (“MBC”), tesetaxel was shown to have significant, single-agent antitumor activity in two multicenter, Phase 2 studies. Tesetaxel currently is the subject of three studies in MBC, including a multinational, multicenter, randomized, Phase 3 study in patients with MBC, known as CONTESSA. Positive results of CONTESSA were presented at the 2020 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (“SABCS”). We plan to submit a New Drug Application (“NDA”) for tesetaxel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in mid-2021. Our goal for tesetaxel is to develop an effective chemotherapy choice for patients that provides quality-of-life advantages over current alternatives.
 Breast Cancer and Its Treatment
 Breast cancer is the most common cancer worldwide, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases diagnosed per year (World Health Organization). In Europe, an estimated 531,000 new cases are diagnosed and approximately 142,000 women will die of the disease each year, making it the leading cause of cancer death in women (World Health Organization). In the U.S., an estimated 279,000 new cases are diagnosed and approximately 42,000 women will die of the disease each year, making it the second-leading cause of cancer death in women (American Cancer Society).

Breast Cancer Incidence and Deaths Remain High

 Breast cancer typically is staged (Stage 0-IV) based on the size of the tumor, whether or not the tumor is invasive, whether or not the cancer is in the lymph nodes and whether or not the cancer has spread (metastasized) to other parts of the body beyond the breast. The prognosis for women with MBC remains poor; the 5-year survival rate for metastatic disease is about 28% (American Cancer Society), making this an area of continued, high unmet medical need. Therefore, treatment that balances efficacy, tolerability and quality of life is preferred.
 Clinical Benefit Is a Balance of Efficacy, Tolerability and Quality of Life

Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease comprised of several molecular subtypes, which are commonly grouped into clinical subtypes based on receptor status (Perou et al., Nature 2000;406:747-752). Receptors that are assessed in standard clinical practice include the estrogen receptor (“ER”) and progesterone receptor (“PgR”), collectively the hormone receptors (“HRs”), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (“HER2”). Breast cancers generally are categorized by the presence or absence of these receptors. The most common type of breast cancer is HR positive and HER2 negative, accounting for approximately 64% of newly diagnosed cases (Howlader et al., Journal of the National Cancer Institute 2014;106(5):1-8). HER2-positive breast cancer and triple-negative breast cancer (“TNBC”), the latter of which lacks all three receptors, are less common, accounting for approximately 13% and 11% of breast cancers, respectively (Howlader et al., Journal of the National Cancer Institute 2014;106(5):1-8).

 Treatment of HR-Positive, HER2-Negative MBC
 HR-positive, HER2-negative disease, which represents the majority of all MBC cases, remains an area of high unmet medical need. Over the past two decades, only modest survival benefits have been achieved in this patient population; hence, treatment goals emphasize controlling disease-related symptoms, minimizing toxicity and maximizing quality-of-life: “…therapeutic goals for those with advanced disease include disease control, preservation or improvement in quality of life and prolongation of survival, with symptom palliation…” (Di Leo A et al., The Breast 2015;24:321-330). Patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative disease are typically treated with endocrine therapy (with or without a CDK 4/6 inhibitor), chemotherapy or both.
 Endocrine Therapy
 Endocrine agents, with or without targeted agents such as a CDK 4/6 inhibitor, are preferred as initial treatment prior to chemotherapy for most patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative MBC (National Comprehensive Cancer Network). These agents, which typically are used sequentially, include aromatase inhibitors (e.g., anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole), selective ER modulators (e.g., tamoxifen) and ER downregulators (e.g., fulvestrant). As initial therapy in post-menopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative disease, letrozole plus the recently approved CDK 4/6 inhibitor, palbociclib, resulted in median progression-free survival (“PFS”) of 24.8 months, compared to 14.5 months with letrozole alone (Finn et al., New England Journal of Medicine 2016;375(20):1925-1936). As second-line

endocrine therapy in women with HR-positive, HER2-negative disease, fulvestrant plus palbociclib resulted in median PFS of 9.5 months, compared to 4.6 months with fulvestrant alone (Cristofanilli et al., The Lancet 2016;17(4):425-439). However, despite these recent advances in endocrine therapy, virtually all patients will progress and require subsequent treatment, typically with chemotherapy.
 Chemotherapy
 In HR-positive, HER2-negative MBC, chemotherapy generally is used following progression on endocrine therapy or in women for whom endocrine therapy is not indicated. Chemotherapy should be “…continued until progression of disease as tolerated because it modestly improves overall survival and substantially improves PFS, but this has to be balanced against toxicity and quality of life” (Partridge et al., Journal of Clinical Oncology 2014;32:3307-3329).
 While endocrine therapy is most often the first-line treatment for women with HR-positive, HER2-negative MBC, a significant percentage of women receive chemotherapy as their first treatment for advanced disease. In a recent analysis of a large patient record database (n=1,272-1,640 in Europe and n=2,225-2,760 in the U.S.), chemotherapy-only regimens were given as the first therapy following a diagnosis of advanced disease 33%-35% of the time in Europe and 34%-42% of the time in the U.S. (Caldeira et al., Oncology and Therapy 2016;4:189-197). This suggests that a significant percentage of women are not indicated for endocrine therapy in the advanced setting due to: (i) a short relapse-free interval while on adjuvant endocrine therapy (endocrine resistance); (ii) rapidly progressing disease/visceral crisis; or (iii) endocrine intolerance.
 There are several approved chemotherapy agents for the treatment of HER2-negative MBC. These include: paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel and docetaxel (taxanes); capecitabine (a fluoropyrimidine); doxorubicin and epirubicin (anthracyclines); gemcitabine (a nucleoside inhibitor); ixabepilone (an epothilone; approved in the U.S.); and eribulin (a non-taxane microtubule dynamics inhibitor). The taxanes and eribulin are approved as monotherapy, capecitabine is approved as both monotherapy and combination therapy (with docetaxel), gemcitabine is approved as combination therapy only (with paclitaxel) and ixabepilone is approved in the U.S. as both monotherapy and combination therapy (with capecitabine).
 While sequential monotherapy is appropriate for many patients, chemotherapy combinations are considered useful in patients with high tumor burden, rapidly progressing disease and visceral crisis (the National Comprehensive Cancer Network [“NCCN”] Guidelines for Invasive Breast Cancer [V1.2021]). No optimal sequence of chemotherapies is known, and choice of individual regimens and agents depends on physician preferences, as well as previous therapies, residual toxic effects, tumor burden and symptoms (Harbeck et al., Breast Cancer Research and Treatment 2017;161:63-72; Schwartzberg et al., Clinical Breast Cancer 2012;12:87-93). However, capecitabine, an oral chemotherapy and taxanes are the preferred first-line chemotherapy agents in HR-positive, HER2-negative MBC (Lin et al., Cancer Medicine 2016;5(2):209-220).

Taxanes
 Taxanes are an established class of anticancer agents that are broadly used in various cancers, including breast cancer. Taxanes destroy cancer cells by preventing them from entering mitosis, a process of cell division, and thereby leading to apoptosis, or cell death. Taxanes are one of the most widely used classes of chemotherapy agents in both Europe and the U.S., with more than 2.8 million cycles administered in 2016 (Symphony Health Solutions 2016; IMS Health 2016).

While paclitaxel and docetaxel, the first two taxanes approved for the treatment of breast cancer, possess robust antitumor activity, they have low oral bioavailability and low solubility. Therefore, these pharmaceutical agents must be delivered intravenously, typically at an infusion center, and also are formulated with solubilizing agents that are known to cause hypersensitivity reactions. Nab-paclitaxel, a different formulation of paclitaxel that also is approved for the treatment of breast cancer, has a greatly reduced risk of hypersensitivity reactions, but must still be delivered intravenously.
 Therapies that must be given intravenously at an infusion center often are associated with(1):
  
• fear of needles and complications associated with venous access; • anxiety, including institutional-triggered side effects such as nausea and vomiting; • heightened awareness of life-threatening disease presence; and • disruption of daily activities

Capecitabine
 Capecitabine is an oral chemotherapy agent that is considered a standard-of-care treatment in MBC (the NCCN Guidelines for Invasive Breast Cancer [V1.2021] indicate that capecitabine is a preferred regimen for HER2-negative disease). The approved dosing regimen for capecitabine in the treatment of MBC is 1,250 mg/m² dosed orally twice per day (for a total daily dose of 2,500 mg/m²) for 14 days of a 21-day cycle.

Tesetaxel: An Orally Administered Taxane with Improved Pharmacologic Properties
 Tesetaxel is an investigational, orally administered chemotherapy agent that belongs to a class of drugs known as taxanes, which are widely used in the treatment of cancer. Tesetaxel has several properties that make it unique among taxanes, including:

• | oral administration with a low pill burden;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | a long (~8-day) t1/2 in humans, enabling the maintenance of adequate drug levels with relatively infrequent dosing;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | no history of hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | significant activity against chemotherapy-resistant tumors.
--+------------------------------------------------------------

 8


Tesetaxel, which we believe will qualify as a New Chemical Entity (“NCE”), retains the same taxane core as the approved taxanes, but includes the addition of two novel, nitrogen-containing functional groups. Tesetaxel is chemically designed to:
  
• | not be substantially effluxed by the P-glycoprotein (“P-gp”) pump, with the intent of retaining activity against chemotherapy-resistant tumor cells;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | have high oral bioavailability;
--+--------------------------------


• | have high solubility; and
--+--------------------------


• | have a long t1/2 in humans.

In patients with MBC, tesetaxel, administered orally as 2-5 capsules at a dose of 27 mg/m² on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle, was shown to have significant, single-agent antitumor activity in two multicenter, Phase 2 studies. Tesetaxel currently is the subject of three studies in MBC, including a multinational, multicenter, randomized, Phase 3 study in patients with MBC, known as CONTESSA. Positive results of CONTESSA were presented at the 2020 SABCS. We plan to submit an NDA for tesetaxel to the FDA in mid-2021. Our goal for tesetaxel is to develop an effective chemotherapy choice for patients that provides quality-of-life advantages over current alternatives.

Nonclinical Studies
 Tesetaxel has exhibited potent antitumor activity in both in vitro (in a test tube) and in vivo (in a live organism) nonclinical studies (Shionoya et al., Cancer Science 2003;94(5):459-466). Tesetaxel retains potent antitumor activity against chemotherapy-resistant tumor cells, including tumor cells over-expressing the P-gp efflux pump. A defense mechanism of tumor cells, this efflux pump functions to expel toxins, including many chemotherapy agents.
 Tesetaxel has exhibited potent antitumor activity in in vitro nonclinical studies, with an overall GI50 of less than 1 nM. GI50 is a commonly used nonclinical measurement of antitumor potency; lower GI50 numbers connote higher potency (1 nM is 1/1,000th of 1 µM). In human tumor cell lines, tesetaxel largely retained antitumor cytotoxic (cell-killing) potency against taxane-resistant (P-gp positive) and other chemotherapy-resistant tumors, while paclitaxel and docetaxel lost considerable antitumor potency (Shionoya et al., Cancer Science 2003;94(5):459-466). Consistent with this finding, the uptake and accumulation of tesetaxel in both P-gp negative and P-gp positive tumor cells were greater than that of either paclitaxel or docetaxel.

Clinical Studies
 As of December 31, 2020, more than 1,200 patients have been treated with tesetaxel in 26 clinical studies. Tesetaxel was administered as monotherapy in 19 studies and in combination with other agents in 7 studies. Studies have been completed in MBC, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and other solid tumors as first-line, second-line or salvage therapy.
Study TOB203: A Phase 2 Study of Tesetaxel as First-line Chemotherapy for MBC
 Study TOB203 was a multicenter, Phase 2 study in patients with HER2-negative MBC who had not been previously treated with chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Thirty-eight (38) patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative MBC were treated with tesetaxel monotherapy at a starting dose of 27 mg/m2 with the potential to escalate to 35 mg/m2 dosed orally on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle. Objective response rate (“ORR”) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 was the primary endpoint (Seidman et al., 2018 ASCO Annual Meeting).
 12

Median age was 58 years (range: 36-80 years). Eighty-seven percent (87%) of patients had visceral disease, 74% of patients were previously treated with at least one endocrine therapy, 68% of patients were previously treated with neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and 53% of patients were previously treated with a taxane-containing regimen.
Exposure and Patient Characteristics
  
ECOG=Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group

 In all 38 patients, the confirmed response rate was 45%. The confirmed response rate was consistent across subgroups. Forty-four percent (44%) of patients who had not been previously treated with a taxane-containing regimen achieved a confirmed response, compared to 45% of patients who were previously treated with a taxane-containing regimen. Median duration of response (“DoR”) was 10.9 months, and median PFS was 5.4 months.

Six hundred eighty-five (685) patients were enrolled in CONTESSA, including 45% in North America, 37% in Europe and 18% in Asia‑Pacific. One hundred percent (100%) of patients had been previously treated with a taxane, approximately 86% had been previously treated with an anthracycline and approximately 50% had been previously treated with a CDK 4/6 inhibitor. Approximately 80% of patients had visceral disease.

CONTESSA met the primary endpoint of improved PFS as assessed by the IRC. Median PFS was 9.8 months for tesetaxel plus a reduced dose of capecitabine versus 6.9 months for the approved dose of capecitabine alone, an improvement of 2.9 months. The risk of disease progression or death was reduced by 28.4% [hazard ratio=0.716 (95% confidence interval [“CI”]: 0.573-0.895); p=0.003] for patients who were treated with tesetaxel plus a reduced dose of capecitabine versus patients who were treated with the approved dose of capecitabine alone.

Capecitabine is an oral chemotherapy agent that is considered a standard-of-care treatment in MBC. Where indicated, patients must have been treated with endocrine therapy with or without a CDK 4/6 inhibitor. The primary endpoint is ORR as assessed by the IRC. The secondary efficacy endpoints are DoR as assessed by the IRC, PFS as assessed by the IRC, DCR as assessed by the IRC and OS. Enrollment was complete in August 2020, and the study is ongoing.

CONTESSA TRIO
 CONTESSA TRIO is a multi-cohort, multicenter, Phase 2 study of tesetaxel, an investigational, orally administered taxane, in patients with MBC.
  
• | In Cohort 1, approximately 200 patients with triple-negative MBC who have not been treated with prior chemotherapy for advanced disease will be randomized 1:1:1 to be treated with tesetaxel dosed orally at 27 mg/m2 on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle plus either: (i) nivolumab at 360 mg by intravenous (“IV”) infusion on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle; (ii) pembrolizumab at 200 mg by IV infusion on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle; or (iii) atezolizumab at 1,200 mg by IV infusion on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab (programmed cell death protein 1 [“PD-1”] inhibitors) and atezolizumab (a programmed death-ligand 1 [“PD-L1”] inhibitor) are immuno-oncology (“IO”) agents approved for the treatment of multiple types of cancer. Two of these agents, atezolizumab and pembrolizumab, have been approved by the FDA as a first-line treatment for patients with triple-negative MBC. The primary endpoints for Cohort 1 are ORR and PFS in patients with PD-L1 positive status. The secondary endpoints are ORR and PFS in all patients, DoR and OS. Efficacy results for each of the three PD-(L)1 inhibitor combinations will be assessed for correlation with the results of each of the three approved PD-L1 diagnostic assays. Enrollment is ongoing.

Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are extremely competitive. Our potential competitors in the field are many in number and include major and mid-sized pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Many of our potential competitors have significantly more financial, technical and other resources than we do, which may give them a competitive advantage. In addition, they may have substantially more experience in effecting strategic combinations, in-licensing technology, developing drugs, obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing products. We cannot give any assurances that we can compete effectively with these other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Any products that we may develop or discover will compete in highly competitive markets. Our potential competitors in these markets may succeed in developing products that could render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive.
 Tesetaxel faces significant competition. Multiple chemotherapies are currently available to physicians and patients for the treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative MBC. These include: paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel and docetaxel (taxanes); capecitabine (a fluoropyrimidine); doxorubicin and epirubicin (anthracyclines); gemcitabine (a nucleoside inhibitor); and eribulin (a non-taxane microtubule dynamics inhibitor). The taxanes and eribulin are approved as monotherapy, capecitabine is approved as both monotherapy and combination therapy (with docetaxel) and gemcitabine is approved as combination therapy only (with paclitaxel). In addition, there are novel oral paclitaxel formulations in development, such as Athenex, Inc.’s Oral Paclitaxel and Daehwa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.’s DHP107. We believe that the extent to which tesetaxel is adopted by the marketplace, if it is approved, will depend on factors such as its safety and tolerability, efficacy, convenience, effect on quality-of-life and cost-effectiveness relative to other treatment alternatives.

 In 2013, we licensed rights to tesetaxel in all major markets from Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (“Daiichi Sankyo”), the original inventor of the product. Tesetaxel had previously been licensed to Genta Incorporated.
 Under the Daiichi Sankyo license agreement, we currently hold exclusive rights to 15 issued patents worldwide covering our tesetaxel program. See “Business—Patents and Proprietary Rights.” We are obligated under the license agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize tesetaxel in the following countries: France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and the U.S. We are required to make aggregate future milestone payments of up to $31.0 million, contingent on attainment of certain regulatory milestones, none of which have been achieved. Additionally, we are obligated to pay Daiichi Sankyo a tiered royalty that ranges from the low to high single digits, depending on annual net sales of tesetaxel. To date, no payments have been made to Daiichi Sankyo under the license agreement. The license agreement and accompanying royalty obligation terminate on a country-by-country basis on the last-to-expire patent in each such country, which we expect will be between 2026 and 2031 in the U.S., 2025 and 2030 in European countries and 2025 and 2030 in Japan, depending on the availability and application of patent term extensions.
 NCE Exclusivity
 We believe that tesetaxel will qualify as an NCE. If tesetaxel qualifies as an NCE, NCE market exclusivity and analogous regulatory exclusivities in Europe and Japan will provide exclusivity for tesetaxel in the U.S., Europe and Japan for specified periods of time. Separate from patent protection, exclusivity refers to certain delays and prohibitions on approval of competitor drugs available under the statute that attach on approval of a drug.
 Exclusivity in the U.S.
 In the U.S., NCEs approved by the FDA are eligible for market exclusivity under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), which can delay the approval of generic versions of the NCE by up to 
 27

7.5 years from the date of the initial approval of the NCE. Specifically, the FDCA provides a 5-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for an NCE. An NCE is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other full NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion (excluding those appended portions of the molecule that cause the drug to be an ester, salt or other noncovalent derivative of the molecule) responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the first 4 years of the 5-year market exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA that relies on the original NDA as a reference. At the end of four years of market exclusivity, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted to the FDA if it contains a “paragraph IV” certification, which refers to a certification of invalidity or non-infringement of a patent that covers the reference NCE drug or its approved use and is listed in the FDA’s publication of Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly referred to as the Orange Book. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant must notify each patent holder and the NDA holder of the “paragraph IV” certification within 20 days after the postmark on the FDA letter acknowledging receipt of the ANDA. If the patented drug product is an NCE and a patent holder or its representative or an exclusive patent licensee brings suit for patent infringement within 45 days after receipt of the notice of a “paragraph IV” certification, market exclusivity for the patented drug may extend to 7.5 years from the date of approval of the NDA for the patented drug product. The period of market exclusivity may be shortened if a court enters a judgment, settlement order or consent decree stating that the patent has been infringed, is invalid or is unenforceable before the end of the 7.5 years, at which time the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be approved.
 NCE market exclusivity will not preclude the submission or approval of a full NDA for the same or similar drug. An applicant submitting a full NDA for the same drug as the NCE drug would be required to conduct or sponsor nonclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical studies, or obtain a right of reference to data from such studies conducted or owned by a third party, necessary to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the drug for its intended use and meet all other criteria for marketing approval.
 Exclusivity in Europe
 In Europe, new active substances qualify for 8 years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity, for a total of 10 years of regulatory exclusivity. This exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referring to the innovator’s data to assess a generic application for 8 years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but the generic product may not be approved for two years. This 10-year period can be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first 8 years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications that, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
 However, even if a compound is considered to be a new active substance and the sponsor is able to gain the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the drug if such company can complete a full Marketing Authorization Application with a complete database of pharmaceutical tests, nonclinical studies and clinical studies and obtain marketing approval of its product.
 Exclusivity in Japan
 In Japan, new active substances are eligible for at least 8 years of regulatory exclusivity. Specifically, under the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law, the regulatory authority re-examines the safety and efficacy of drugs after drug approval. The data submitted to the regulatory authority is not available to generic drug companies during the re-examination period. This effectively makes the re-examination system a regulatory exclusivity system in Japan. The re-examination period is 10 years following approval for an orphan drug and 8 years for a new active substance. Innovators may also benefit from an additional 4- to 10-month waiting period for generic pricing approval. There may be an additional 4 years of market protection granted if a new indication for a drug is registered in the first 8 years of the re-examination period.

Patents and Proprietary Rights
 The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our product candidates, processes and know-how are important to our business. Our success depends in part on our ability to protect the proprietary nature of our product candidates, processes and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek and maintain patent protection in the U.S. and internationally for our product candidates and other technology. We endeavor to patent or in-license technology, inventions and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business. In addition to patent protection, we intend to use other means to protect our proprietary rights, including pursuing periods of marketing or data exclusivity, orphan drug status (if applicable) and similar rights that are available under regulatory provisions in certain jurisdictions, including the U.S., Europe and Japan. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
 The intellectual property portfolio protecting our tesetaxel program includes 8 U.S., 4 European and 5 Japanese patents, as well as 2 pending international patent applications, 1 pending U.S. patent application, 1 pending European patent application and 1 pending Japanese patent application. Of these, 4 U.S., 3 European and 3 Japanese patents are exclusively licensed to us by Daiichi Sankyo. The 17 issued patents consist of the following:
  
• | Eight (8) U.S. patents, including: (i) 1 composition-of-matter patent expiring in 2026, without taking into account any potential patent term restoration; (ii) 5 patents with claims to manufacturing methods and/or manufacturing intermediates expiring between 2023 and 2032, without taking into account any potential patent term restoration; and (iii) 2 patents with composition-of-matter, method of manufacture and/or method of use claims relating to alternate salt forms of tesetaxel expiring in 2031, without taking into account any potential patent term restoration.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Four (4) European patents, including: (i) 1 composition-of-matter patent expiring in 2022, without taking into account any potential patent term restoration; and (ii) 3 patents with claims to manufacturing methods and/or manufacturing intermediates expiring in 2022, 2025 and 2031, without taking into account any potential patent term restoration.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Five (5) Japanese patents, including: (i) 1 composition-of-matter patent expiring in 2022, without taking into account any potential patent term restoration; and (ii) 4 patents with claims to manufacturing methods and/or manufacturing intermediates expiring in 2022, 2025, 2025 and 2031, without taking into account any potential patent term restoration.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Among these patents, one issued U.S. composition-of-matter patent (U.S. Patent No. 7,410,980) covers the crystal form of tesetaxel used in our clinical formulation and will expire in 2026. If tesetaxel is approved by the FDA, we will be entitled to request patent term restoration that could extend the protection of this patent into 2031. The exact duration of the extension depends on the time we spend in clinical studies as well as the time the FDA spends reviewing our NDA. See “Business—Government Regulation—U.S. Patent Term Restoration.” We do not anticipate that the European and Japanese patents that correspond to this U.S. patent will receive corresponding patent term restorations.
 Our success depends on an intellectual property portfolio that will support our future revenue streams. We intend to maintain and build our patent portfolio through filing new patent applications and prosecuting existing applications. We cannot be certain that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications that we may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. Any of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Intellectual Property.”

Manufacturing
 We currently contract with third-party contract development and manufacturing organizations (“CDMOs”) for the manufacture of tesetaxel and intend to do so in the future. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities and currently have no plans to build our own clinical- or commercial-scale manufacturing capabilities. Although we rely on CDMOs, we have personnel with extensive manufacturing experience to oversee these contract service providers.
 We conduct our manufacturing activities under individual purchase orders with multiple CDMOs. To date, our third-party manufacturers have met our manufacturing requirements. We expect third-party manufacturers to be capable of providing sufficient quantities of tesetaxel to meet anticipated full-scale commercial demands. To meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing, third parties with whom we currently work with might need to increase their scale of production, or we will need to secure alternate suppliers. We believe that there are alternate sources of supply that can satisfy our anticipated clinical and commercial requirements, although we cannot be certain that identifying and establishing relationships with such sources, if necessary, would not result in significant delay or material additional costs.
 Sales and Marketing
 In order to commercialize tesetaxel, if approved, or any other product candidates that we may develop, we must build marketing, sales and distribution capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. The commercial infrastructure for oncology products typically consists of a sales force that calls on oncologists, supported by sales management, medical liaisons, internal sales and marketing support and distribution support.
 Additional capabilities important to the oncology marketplace include the management of key accounts such as managed care organizations, integrated delivery networks, group-purchasing organizations, specialty pharmacies and government accounts. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure, we will have to invest significant amounts of financial and management resources, some of which will be committed prior to any confirmation that any of our product candidates will be approved.
 Where appropriate, we may elect in the future to utilize marketing partners, distributors or contract sales forces to assist in the commercialization of tesetaxel.
 Government Regulation
 Governmental authorities in the U.S., Europe, Japan and other countries where we may seek approval to commercialize tesetaxel extensively regulate the research, development, testing, manufacture, approval and marketing of pharmaceutical products. Our product candidates must be approved by these regulatory authorities before they may be legally marketed in the applicable jurisdictions. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Below is a general summary of applicable government regulations affecting our current and planned business activities in the U.S., Europe and Japan.
U.S. Government Regulation
 In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the FDCA and its implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development or approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include:

• | refusal to approve pending applications;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | withdrawal of an approval;
--+---------------------------

 30


 
• | imposition of a clinical hold;
--+-------------------------------


• | warning or untitled letters;
--+-----------------------------


• | seizures or administrative detention of product;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | total or partial suspension of production or distribution;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions, fines, restitution, disgorgement, refusal of government contracts or civil or criminal penalties; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

U.S. Drug Approval Process
 The process required by the FDA before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests, in vivo nonclinical studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices and other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug (“IND”) application, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to current Good Clinical Practices (“cGCPs”) and other applicable regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA or other applications for approval;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”) and conformance with the manufacturing-related elements of the application to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the study sites that generated the data in support of the NDA;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA; and
--+----------------------------------------


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, such as post-approval studies required by the FDA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the nonclinical testing stage. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND will also include a protocol detailing the objectives of the clinical study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated.
 All clinical studies must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with FDA requirements. An institutional review board (“IRB”) must review and approve the protocol and will monitor the study until completion. Clinical studies must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the study, dosing procedures, research subject selection, inclusion and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol, and any material amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and sponsors must report to the FDA serious and unexpected adverse reactions in a timely manner. Sponsors also must make certain financial disclosures to the FDA regarding any financial relationships with study investigators.
 Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined.
 31

 
• | Phase 1—The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination. Initial human testing is often conducted in patients for product candidates intended to treat severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product candidate may be inherently too toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2—Clinical studies are performed on a limited patient population intended to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3—Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval and labeling. A pivotal study is a clinical study that is intended to meet regulatory authority requirements for the evaluation of a product candidate’s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the product. In certain instances, the FDA may require the completion of post-approval studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, which are conducted after initial regulatory approval to collect additional information from the treatment of patients for the intended indication or to meet other regulatory requirements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Human clinical studies are inherently uncertain, and Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3 or post-approval studies may not be successfully completed or may not be completed at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical study at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 The results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical studies, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests and other control mechanisms, direction for use, proposed labeling, patent information and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to accept any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth, substantive review of the NDA, which includes an assessment of the nonclinical and clinical data, the product’s formulation and manufacturing and whether the product is safe and effective for the proposed intended use. The FDA’s review goal for NDAs for new molecular entities is 10 months from the date the application is accepted for filing for a standard review and 6 months from the date the application is accepted for filing for a priority review. The FDA does not always meet these goal dates for standard and priority review NDAs, and the review process can be significantly extended by requests from the FDA for additional information or clarification.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee, which for Fiscal Year 2021 runs at approximately $2.88 million for NDAs requiring clinical trials, as well as a program fee for prescription human drugs of approximately $336,000. Fee waivers or reductions are available, such as for the first application by a small business or for certain products designated as Orphan Drugs under the Orphan Drug Act.
 FDA Expedited Review and Approval
 The FDA has various programs, including fast-track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval and priority review, each of which are intended to facilitate and expedite the development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions. Different qualifying criteria apply to each program, and each program offers different mechanisms to expedite the development or approval process, such as additional opportunities to meet with the FDA regarding the product candidate’s clinical development program, the opportunity for 
 32

rolling review of a marketing application, approval based on a surrogate endpoint or, in the case of priority review, a shorter timeline for reviewing a marketing application. We may seek to take advantage of one or more of these expedited programs for tesetaxel or other product candidates in the future. However, even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the development or approval of the product candidate may not be shortened. The FDA may also later determine that a product candidate no longer meets the criteria for designation, and designation does not guarantee that the FDA will ultimately approve the product.
 U.S. Patent Term Restoration
 Depending on the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, one of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to 5 years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process, provided the patent term restoration does not extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. In the future, if available, we intend to apply for an extension of patent term for one of our currently owned patents beyond its current expiration date; however, there can be no assurance that any such extension will be granted to us.
 U.S. Post-Approval Requirements
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval for various reasons, such as non-compliance with regulatory requirements or significant safety and performance problems with the product. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in recalls or restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Holders of an approved NDA are required to report certain adverse reactions to the FDA and maintain pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for these adverse events. Manufacturers are also required to comply with restrictions on the advertising and promotion of their products, including restrictions on “off-label” promotion for uses outside those described in the approved product labeling.
 In addition, after a product candidate has been approved, the FDA may require that certain additional post-approval requirements be satisfied, including the conduct of additional clinical studies. Certain changes to an approved product, such as adding new indications, making certain manufacturing changes or making certain additional labeling claims are subject to further FDA review and approval. Before a company can market products for additional indications, it must obtain approval from the FDA of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which generally requires that additional clinical studies be conducted. A company cannot be sure that any additional approval for new indications for any product candidate will be approved on a timely basis, or at all.
 Changes to the manufacturing process for a given drug are strictly regulated and, depending on the significance of the change, may require FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMPs and impose reporting and documentation requirements on us and any third-party manufacturers we use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs and other aspects of regulatory compliance and are subject to periodic or for-cause inspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities to ensure such compliance.
 U.S. Reimbursement and Pricing
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of tesetaxel and any other products for which we may seek regulatory approval. Sales in the U.S. will depend in part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, which include government health programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Veterans Administration, as well as managed care organizations and private health insurers. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our product candidates can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by payors.
 33

The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. Medicare Part D, Medicare’s outpatient prescription drug benefit, contains protections to ensure coverage and reimbursement for oral oncology products, and all Part D prescription drug plans are required to cover substantially all oral anti-cancer agents. However, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be available.
 Private payors often rely on the lead of the governmental payors in rendering coverage and reimbursement determinations. Sales of our product candidates will therefore depend substantially on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by third-party payors. Achieving favorable coverage and reimbursement from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) and/or the Medicare Administrative Contractors is typically a significant gating issue for successful introduction of a new product.
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for marketing, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, which would be in addition to the costs expended to obtain regulatory approvals. Third-party payors may not consider our product candidates to be medically necessary or cost-effective compared to other available therapies, or the rebate percentages required to secure favorable coverage may not yield an adequate margin over cost or may not enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development.
 U.S. Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws and Compliance Requirements
 We are subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales and marketing programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:

• | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example gifts, cash payments, donations, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, waivers of payment, ownership interests, and providing any item, service or compensation for something other than fair market value. Federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services that are false or fraudulent. Although we may not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws in a variety of ways. These include: providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, improperly promoting a product’s off-label use, violating the Anti-Kickback Statute or misreporting pricing information to government programs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 34

 
• | The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act requirements, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which require manufacturers of certain drugs and biologics to track and report to CMS payments and other transfers of value they make to U.S. physicians and teaching hospitals as well as physician ownership and investment interests in the manufacturer.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, which impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Section 1927 of the Social Security Act, which requires that manufacturers of drugs and biological products covered by Medicaid report pricing information to CMS on a monthly and quarterly basis, including the best price available to any customer of the manufacturer, with certain exceptions for government programs, and pay prescription rebates to state Medicaid programs based on a statutory formula derived from reported pricing information. State law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, state transparency reporting and compliance laws; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and which may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

European Government Regulation
 In Europe, tesetaxel and any future products we may seek to develop and commercialize will also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the U.S., medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory authorities has been obtained.
 Similar to the U.S., the various phases of nonclinical and clinical research in Europe are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC (the “Directive”) has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical study can be initiated, it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the study is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: The National Competent Authority (“NCA”) and one or more Ethics Committees (“EC”). Under the current regime, all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical study have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
 In 2014, a new Clinical Trials Regulation 536/2014 (the “Regulation”), which will replace the current Directive, was adopted. The new Regulation will become directly applicable in all EU Member States (without national implementation) once the EU Portal and Database are fully functional. Until that time, the Directive remains in force and continues to apply to clinical studies in the EU. It is expected that the Regulation will apply in 2021, although this timing may be further delayed. The new Regulation seeks to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical studies in the EU. For example, the sponsor shall submit a single application for approval of a clinical study via the EU Portal. As part of the application process, the sponsor shall propose a reporting Member State, which will coordinate the validation and evaluation of the application. The reporting Member State shall consult and coordinate with the other concerned Member States. If an application is rejected, it can be amended and resubmitted through the EU Portal. If an approval is issued, the sponsor can start the clinical study in all concerned Member States. However, a concerned Member State can, in limited circumstances, declare an “opt-out” from an approval. In such a case, the clinical study cannot be conducted in that Member State. The Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting, and introduces enhanced transparency requirements such as mandatory submission of a summary of the clinical study results to the EU Database.
 35

European Drug Approval Process
 In the European Economic Area (“EEA”), which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (“MA”). There are two types of marketing authorizations:

• | The Centralized (or Community) MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”), of the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of drugs, such as biotechnology medicinal drugs, orphan medicinal drugs and medicinal drugs containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for drugs containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for drugs that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. Under the Centralized Procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, defined by three cumulative criteria: the seriousness of the disease (e.g., disabling or life-threatening diseases) to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days, excluding clock stops.

• | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for drugs not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a drug has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the drug has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure, an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (“RMS”). Within 120 days after receipt of a valid application, the competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the drug characteristics (“SmPC”) and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Concerned Member States) for their approval. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report and related materials, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If the Concerned Member States raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SmPC, labeling or packaging proposed by the RMS, the drug is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Concerned Member States).

 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the drug on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
 Patent Term Extension in Europe
 Similar to the patent term extensions available in the U.S., European patent law offers the possibility to apply for a supplementary protection certificate (“SPC”) in order to compensate patent holders for the regulatory delays caused by marketing authorization procedures for medicinal products. SPCs extend the patent term for a period that is equal to the time that elapsed between the filing date of the patent application and the date of the first marketing authorization in the EU, minus 5 years. The overall term of an SPC may not exceed 5 years. An SPC may afford a maximum patent duration of 25 years or, when calculated from the date of first marketing approval, an effective patent exclusivity period of 15 years after 
 36

first marketing authorization. Applications for SPCs must be filed and approved on a country-by-country basis.
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Reimbursement and Pricing in Europe
 In Europe, similar political, economic and regulatory developments may affect our ability to profitably commercialize tesetaxel or any other products, if approved. European countries vary significantly in their approach to coverage, reimbursement and pricing assessments. Some countries allow drug products to be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed to. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies, or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. The considerations in each country can also vary with respect to the value placed on unmet need, generic availability, dosing, administration, level of innovation and many other dynamics. In certain cases, these decisions are made sequentially and are often interdependent. Many also have multi-layered, decision-making bodies at the country, regional, local and even hospital level, with various responsibilities within the process.
 For example, the United Kingdom typically bases reimbursement decision on a determination of cost effectiveness as defined by cost per quality-adjusted life year (“QALY”), as assessed by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (“NICE”). Funding by the National Health Service is typically granted on an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (“ICER”) of £30,000 or less per QALY. Unlike other countries, the United Kingdom does have a specific process for cancer therapies that do not gain NICE recommendation initially. Cancer therapies can enter into a conditional reimbursement agreement for no more than two years funded by the Cancer Drug Fund while clinical value continues to be assessed in order to inform the final guidance. At the end of this two-year period, recommendation may be granted for permanent reimbursement on fulfillment of the evidence commitment by the manufacturer.
 Similarly, Germany also makes reimbursement decisions based on the determination of additional benefit. Unlike the ICER approach, an efficiency frontier of the total cost and total benefit of all available agents is employed as a cost-benefit methodology. Newly approved agents are compared in terms of cost-benefit ratio either against alternatives or within a specific indication.
 France has its own system of therapeutic index to assess medicines for reimbursement and pricing. Reimbursement is determined through a Service Médical Rendu rating of clinical benefit (low, moderate, substantial), with the exception of hospital-only drugs that may be reimbursed at 100%. Pricing is negotiated based on an Amélioration du Service Médical Rendu rating of therapeutic improvement compared to available alternatives (negative (VI), no improvement (V), minor (IV), moderate (III), substantial (II), major (I)).
 It is possible that we may be required to conduct cost-effectiveness studies of our product candidates relative to other available therapies in certain countries. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our financial results may suffer.
 Japanese Government Regulation
 Tesetaxel and any future products we may seek to develop and commercialize will also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements in Japan. As in the U.S., medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory authorities has been obtained. In Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (“MHLW”) oversees the regulation and safety of pharmaceuticals, medical devices, cosmetics and food and is the organizational body responsible for approving or rejecting an NDA. Within MHLW, the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (“PMDA”) oversees regulatory affairs for drugs and medical devices and is the body responsible for regulatory review of NDAs.

Japanese Drug Approval Process
 The drug approval process in Japan involves a series of activities, including nonclinical and clinical (Phase 1, 2 and 3) studies, bridging studies, submission of an NDA by the manufacturer and review of the NDA by the PMDA. MHLW and PMDA are the main regulatory authorities regulating clinical studies. To conduct a clinical study, a pharmaceutical company must register a protocol with MHLW. Prior to submitting a protocol to the MHLW, an applicant usually submits a Clinical Trial Notification to the PMDA. All documents must be translated into Japanese. The notification mainly consists of a description and product summary, nonclinical data, the clinical study protocol, analysis plan, SOPs, contact person and the names of participating research institution(s). Also, compliance with cGCPs often requires an IRB to review the clinical study protocol, provide written informed consent forms for participants and report adverse events.
 In order to obtain marketing approval, an applicant must submit an NDA for drug marketing authorization to the PMDA for review. Once the PMDA has received the NDA, a team of reviewers evaluates the application data, including quality, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, toxicology, clinical implications, biostatistics and cGCP on-site inspection. During the review process, the reviewers exchange opinions with external experts (expert meetings) to discuss important problems. A general review conference attended by team members, external experts and representatives of the applicant is held after the expert meeting. After the review, the PMDA makes a recommendation and sends the application to the MHLW. MHLW then obtains a recommendation from the Pharmaceutical Affairs and Food Sanitation Council before making a decision regarding approval or rejection of the application.
 When data from clinical studies performed in foreign countries are used for an NDA in Japan, the data are first checked to assure that it complies with legal requirements in Japan. Following the legal assessment, an evaluation to determine whether or not the drug is apt to be affected by ethnic factors (intrinsic or extrinsic factors) is conducted. When necessary, a bridging study in Japanese patients is performed, and, when it is concluded that the clinical study outcome in a foreign population can be extrapolated to the Japanese population, the foreign data can be accepted. It is mandatory to conduct pharmacokinetic studies in Japanese people.
 Drug approval reviews are normally processed in the order in which the application forms are received. However, orphan drugs and other drugs considered to be especially important from a medical standpoint, such as new drugs to treat serious diseases, may be designated for priority review.
 Products for priority review are given priority at each stage of the review process as much as possible. For example, for products designated for priority review at the development stage, it is possible to obtain priority interview advice on indications and other items concerning the designated product. The target review period for priority review is 9 months, compared to 12 months for standard reviews.
 Patent-term Extension in Japan
 The term of a patent that covers an approved drug may be extended for the shorter of 5 years or the period during which the patent could not be exploited due to obtaining regulatory approval. This period is calculated from the later of the patent registration date (grant date) or the clinical study start date to the regulatory approval date. Unlike in the U.S., patent-term extension in Japan can be applied to more than one patent.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Reimbursement and Pricing in Japan
 In Japan, there is significant uncertainty as to the reimbursement and pricing status of tesetaxel and any other products for which we may seek regulatory approval. Japanese pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to tight government control. Drug prices are set both according to standardized formulas and through negotiations between government officials and applicant companies on a product-by-product basis. In those negotiations, the level of innovation, usefulness and marketability 
 38

are important determinants of price. With few exceptions, the Japanese MHLW sets the reimbursement prices for all newly launched prescription drugs in Japan.
 There are currently three main pricing methodologies, which are dependent on the number of similar products available. The Cost Calculation Method applies to first-to-market products and is based on manufacturer cost inputs as well as international reference markets. Comparison Method I applies to products with less than three non-generic competitors and allows for premiums based on innovation, usefulness and marketability among others, plus an adjustment to international reference markets. Comparison Method II is reserved for products with three or more non-generic competitors and anchors price to the lowest competitor in the basket, with only downward adjustments possible to the international reference markets. Over 80% of products in Japan are priced through Comparison Method I.
 In order to control the proportion of the country’s total healthcare expenditure that is devoted to drugs, the government mandates revisions in the prices of all prescription drugs every two years. However, pricing reform introduced in 2016 may have an impact on the commercial landscape in future years. There are three main changes in discussion, including annual pricing reviews, the addition of a cost-effectiveness analysis and the “huge sellers” provision to reduce budget risk for expensive drugs with significant budget impact. These went into effect in 2018, with additional proposals under consideration for later roll out, including annual reference pricing, indication expansion discounts and optimal use guidelines. These changes may impact the timeline for pricing negotiations as well as the result of these negotiations. The adoption of more restrictive pricing and reimbursement policies along with existing controls could limit our commercial revenue in the Japanese market.
 Rest of the World Regulation
 For other countries outside of the U.S., EU and Japan, such as Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia and emerging markets, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, drug licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, clinical studies must be conducted in accordance with cGCPs and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). Under this act, an emerging growth company may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements for up to 5 years that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These exemptions include, among others:

• | an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement on the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reduced disclosure about executive compensation arrangements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | an exemption from the requirement to seek non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute arrangements; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring a supplement to the auditor’s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have availed ourselves of certain of the exemptions in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we expect to continue to avail ourselves of certain of the exemptions available to emerging growth companies in future filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) as long as we are an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until December 31, 2023 unless, prior to that time, we: (i) have more than $1.07 billion in annual gross revenue; (ii) have a market value for shares of our common stock held by non-affiliates of more than $700 million as of the last day of 
 39

our second quarter of any year; or (iii) issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.
 Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
 Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 153 employees, of which 137 were full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. We also hire consultants and contract with third-parties, as needed, to provide additional resources to support our business activities.
 Our key human capital management objectives are to identify, recruit, integrate, retain and motivate our new and existing employees. We believe that our compensation and benefit programs are appropriately designed to attract and retain qualified talent. Employees receive an annual base salary and are eligible to earn performance-based cash bonuses. To create and maintain a successful work environment, we offer a comprehensive package of additional benefits that support the physical and mental health and wellness of all of our employees and their families. Additionally, we grant equity awards in order to allow for directors, officers, employees and consultants of Odonate to share in the performance of the Company.
