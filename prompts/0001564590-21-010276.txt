Item 1. Business. 
Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage precision oncology company focused on developing targeted therapies to inhibit frontier targets in RAS-addicted cancers. We possess sophisticated structure-based drug discovery capabilities built upon deep chemical biology and cancer pharmacology know-how and innovative, proprietary technologies that enable the creation of small molecules tailored to unconventional binding sites. Our understanding of genetic drivers and adaptive resistance mechanisms in cancer, coupled with robust drug discovery and medicinal chemistry capabilities, has guided us to establish a deep pipeline targeting critical signaling nodes within the RAS pathway and associated pathways. This cohesive approach underpins our clinical strategy of exploring mechanism-based dosing paradigms and in-pathway combinations to optimize treatment for cancer patients. 
 Our research and development pipeline comprises RAS(ON) inhibitors that bind directly to RAS variants, which we refer to as RAS(ON) Inhibitors, and RAS companion inhibitors that target key nodes in the RAS pathway or associated pathways, which we refer to as RAS Companion Inhibitors. Our RAS Companion Inhibitors (e.g., SHP2, mTORC1 and SOS1 inhibitors) are designed primarily for combination treatment strategies involving one or more therapeutic agents, which may include our RAS(ON) Inhibitors or other pathway inhibitors. 
 Our most advanced product candidate is the RAS Companion Inhibitor RMC-4630, designed as a potent and selective inhibitor of SHP2, a central node in the RAS signaling pathway. In collaboration with Sanofi, we are evaluating RMC-4630 in a multi-cohort Phase 1/2 clinical program. This RMC-4630 Phase 1/2 program currently consists of four active clinical trials, one of which includes two arms studying different combinations: 
  
(1) | RMC-4630-01, a Phase 1 study of RMC-4630 as monotherapy;
----+---------------------------------------------------------


(2) | RMC-4630-02, a Phase 1b/2 study which includes an arm studying RMC-4630 in combination with the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib (Cotellic®) and an arm studying RMC-4630 in combination with the EGFR inhibitor osimertinib (Tagrisso®);
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | an Amgen-sponsored Phase 1b study of RMC-4630 in combination with Amgen’s KRASG12C(OFF) inhibitor, AMG 510 or sotorasib; and

(4) | a Sanofi-sponsored Phase 1 study of RMC-4630 in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab (Keytruda®).
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have selected a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule for RMC-4630 monotherapy (200 mg on a Day 1/Day 2 (D1D2)) weekly schedule, and are evaluating this compound at this dose and schedule in an expansion cohort of patients with gynecologic tumors harboring NF1LOF mutations in addition to a small safety and tolerability cohort representing a broader set of histotypes and RAS pathway genotypes. We have also selected a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule for the RMC-4630 and cobimetinib combination (RMC-4630 140 mg and cobimetinib 40 mg administered on a D1D2 weekly schedule), and are evaluating this combination at this dose and schedule in expansion cohorts of patients with colorectal cancer harboring KRASG12V or KRASG12D mutations and others drawing from a broader set of histotypes and RAS pathway genotypes. 
 Our RAS Companion Inhibitor RMC-5552 is designed as a selective inhibitor of hyperactivated mTORC1 signaling in tumors. We plan to evaluate RMC-5552 as a monotherapy, as well as in combination with RAS inhibitors for patients with cancers harboring a RAS mutation and co-occurring mutations in the mTOR signaling pathway. We submitted an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for RMC-5552, and the associated clinical study has been authorized to proceed. We plan to study this candidate first as a monotherapy. 
 
Our RAS Companion Inhibitor RMC-5845 targets SOS1, a protein that plays a key role in converting RAS(OFF) to RAS(ON) in cells. RMC-5845 is in the IND-enabling stage of preclinical development and is intended for select combination therapies for certain genetically-defined tumors. 
 Our RAS(ON) Inhibitors are based on our proprietary tri-complex technology platform, which enables a highly differentiated approach to inhibiting the active, GTP-bound form of RAS, or RAS(ON). We are developing a portfolio of compounds that we believe are the first and only RAS(ON) inhibitors to use this mechanism of action. RMC-6291, our inhibitor targeting KRASG12C/NRASG12C(ON), and RMC-6236, our inhibitor of multiple RAS variants, which we refer to as RASMULTI(ON), are each in IND-enabling preclinical development. In addition, we have inhibitors targeting KRASG13C(ON) and KRASG12D(ON) in the lead optimization stage of preclinical development.

Our strategy 
 Our goal is to develop novel targeted therapies to outsmart cancer for the benefit of patients. We plan to pursue the following strategies: 
 RAS(ON) Inhibitors 
  
• | Establish tri-complex inhibition of RAS(ON) as a first-in-class therapeutic modality. There are dozens of RAS variants that have been implicated as molecular drivers of cancer. We are developing a portfolio of small molecules designed to target multiple oncogenic forms of RAS(ON) that are derived from our proprietary tri-complex technology platform. We believe that targeted inhibition of oncogenic RAS(ON) variants represents a highly differentiated approach for treating the large population of patients with diverse RAS mutations, including non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, colorectal, pancreatic and other cancers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Initially, we intend to advance our first two RAS(ON) development candidates into clinical development. We are conducting IND-enabling studies of RMC-6291, a mutant-selective inhibitor of KRASG12C(ON) and NRASG12C(ON), and RMC-6236, a RAS-selective inhibitor of multiple RAS(ON) variants. We may evaluate RMC-6291 and RMC-6236 or other RAS(ON) development candidates both as monotherapies or in combination with other drugs and investigational new drugs, particularly in-pathway agents and immunotherapies. 
  
• | Deploy our innovation engine against additional frontier targets. In parallel with the IND-enabling development of RMC-6291 and RMC-6236, we are currently focusing on optimization of mutant-selective tri-complex inhibitors of additional targets including KRASG12D(ON) and KRASG13C(ON). While RMC-6236 has demonstrated preclinical activity in models of KRASG12D and KRASG13C-driven cancers, discovery and development of mutant-selective inhibitors of these targets may help to maximize clinical benefit for patients with cancers bearing these RAS variants.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RAS Companion Inhibitors 
  
• | Establish our proprietary SHP2 inhibitor, RMC-4630, as the backbone of targeted therapy combinations for the treatment of RAS-dependent tumors. RMC-4630 is an allosteric inhibitor of SHP2, a convergent node within the oncogenic RAS-signaling pathway. We are evaluating RMC-4630 as both a monotherapy and as a backbone of combination therapies designed to maximize clinical benefit by combatting drug resistance pathways that depend on SHP2. In the future, we may leverage our complementary pipeline of RAS(ON) and RAS Companion Inhibitors by evaluating RMC-4630 in combination with certain RAS(ON) inhibitors, which could include RMC-6291 or RMC-6236.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Demonstrate clinical utility of our RAS Companion Inhibitors targeting mTORC1/4EBP1 (RMC-5552) and SOS1 (RMC-5845) through precision oncology. RMC-5552 is designed as a potent, selective inhibitor of mTORC1/4EBP1 that we expect to evaluate in a clinical trial beginning as a monotherapy in the first of half 2021. In initial clinical trials, we plan to test RMC-5552 both as a monotherapy in patients with cancers harboring genotypes linked to hyperactivated mTORC1 signaling, and as a combination partner for RAS inhibitors in patients with cancers harboring one or more RAS mutations and co-occurring mutations in the mTOR signaling pathway. RMC-5845 is designed as a potent, selective inhibitor of SOS1 that is in the IND-enabling stage of preclinical development. We plan to evaluate RMC-5845 in select combination therapies for certain genetically-defined tumors.

Corporate 
  
• | Maximize the global value of our programs by continuing to execute synergistic and value-creating transactions. We have the organizational capabilities and resources to enable us to continue to complete value-creating transactions, such as our collaboration with Sanofi on SHP2 and our acquisition of Warp Drive. In the future, we may enter into other collaborations where we believe there is an opportunity to accelerate the development and commercialization of our product candidates while allowing us to retain meaningful rights in major markets. We may also seek to acquire or in-license product candidates or technologies opportunistically that are synergistic with our drug discovery and development efforts.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maintain our culture of tireless commitment to patients. As we grow our business, we will continue to apply transformative science in the development of novel targeted therapies for patients suffering from cancers with limited therapeutic options. To accomplish this, we intend to continue building our team of qualified individuals who share our commitment to collaboration and scientific rigor in the development of novel therapies to outsmart cancer and improve the lives of patients.

 Our opportunity: multiple large unmet needs in RAS-addicted cancers 
 RAS mutant epidemiology in the United States 
 Variants in RAS proteins account for approximately 30% of all human cancers in the United States, many of which are fatal. Diverse oncogenic RAS variants in three different RAS isoforms (KRAS, NRAS and HRAS) drive distinct human cancers. Figure 1 below summarizes the estimated new RAS-addicted cancers diagnosed each year in the US organized into convenience groups based on tumor genetics. Based on these data, we believe there are an estimated 230,000 new cancers diagnosed per year that could potentially be addressed by RAS inhibitors in the US alone.

 Our innovation engine 
 We have built an innovation engine that enables us to discover and develop novel targeted therapies for elusive high-value frontier cancer targets with particular focus on a cohesive set of disease targets within notorious growth and survival pathways. This engine is centered around our proprietary tri-complex platform and is bolstered by three complementary pillars: 
  
• | Deep chemical biology and cancer pharmacology know-how, including assays and proprietary tool compounds, to define the critical vulnerabilities of “frontier” RAS and mTOR pathway targets and associated signaling circuits in cancer cells;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sophisticated structure-based drug discovery capabilities, including proven access to complex chemical space, to create drug candidates tailored to unconventional binding sites on elusive cancer targets; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Astute precision medicine approach, embracing patient selection and innovative single agent and combination drug regimens, to translate our preclinical insights into clinical benefit for patients with RAS-addicted cancers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Tri-complex platform 
 Our proprietary tri-complex technology enables us to discover small molecule inhibitors of targets lacking intrinsic drug binding sites by inducing new druggable pockets. This occurs through small molecule-driven formation of a high affinity ternary complex (tri-complex) between the target protein, the small molecule, and a widely expressed cytosolic protein called a chaperone (e.g., FKPB12 or cyclophilin A). This platform technology is the foundation of our RAS(ON) Inhibitor programs. In this context, the inhibitory effect of tri-complex formation on the RAS(ON) target is mediated by steric occlusion of the site where RAS(ON) binds its downstream effector molecules, such as RAF, which are required for propagating the oncogenic signal. Thus, tri-complex formation with RAS(ON) targets disrupts RAS effector binding and terminates oncogenic signaling. Our RAS(ON) tri-complex inhibitors, which are inspired by natural products, are “Beyond Rule of 5” compounds.

 RAS(ON) Inhibitors 
 Overview 
 Our RAS(ON) Inhibitors are based on our proprietary tri-complex technology platform, which enables a highly differentiated approach to inhibiting the active, GTP-bound form of RAS, or RAS(ON). We are developing a portfolio of compounds that we believe are the first and only RAS(ON) inhibitors to use this mechanism of action. Our RAS(ON) compounds, RMC-6291 and RMC-6236, are in the IND-enabling stage of preclinical development as KRASG12C(ON)/NRASG12C (ON) and RASMULTI(ON) inhibitors, respectively. These inhibitors have exhibited anti-tumor activity in vivo in preclinical models. We believe that direct inhibitors of RAS(ON) will suppress cell growth and survival and be less susceptible to adaptive resistance mechanisms recognized for RAS(OFF) inhibitors. We plan to evaluate our RAS(ON) Inhibitors alone and in combination with other drugs and investigational new drugs, particularly in-pathway agents. We also plan to nominate a third RAS(ON) Inhibitor as a development candidate in the second half of 2021. 
 We believe tailored RAS(ON) inhibitors will be necessary in order to serve the diverse landscape of RAS-driven cancers. For some RAS variants like KRASG13C and KRASG12D, we are pursuing additional RAS mutant-selective inhibitors in parallel with the IND-enabling development of RMC-6291 and RMC-6236. For variants like KRASG12V and KRASG12A, we believe discovery of a mutant-selective inhibitor is unlikely, and we plan to focus on optimizing therapeutic regimens for cancers bearing these mutations using our RASMULTI(ON) inhibitor. 
 
RMC-6291 
 RMC-6291, our first mutant-selective RAS(ON) inhibitor development candidate, is in the IND-enabling stage of preclinical development and we currently plan to submit an IND for this drug candidate in the first half of 2022. RMC-6291 is designed as a first-in-class, potent, oral and selective tri-complex inhibitor of KRASG12C/NRASG12C(ON). It exhibits subnanomolar potency for suppressing RAS pathway signaling and growth of KRASG12C-bearing cancer cells and is engineered to be highly selective for KRASG12C/NRASG12C over wild type RAS and other cellular targets. We believe that, in conjunction with its drug-like properties including oral bioavailability across multiple species, the results from our preclinical studies to date evaluating RMC-6291 support advancement to clinical development. 
 We believe that RMC-6291 is differentiated by its mechanism of inhibiting the KRASG12C(ON) form. KRASG12C(OFF) inhibitors have been shown to disrupt RAS-RAF signaling by binding to and sequestering the RAS(OFF) form; their activity is dictated by 
 7

availability of the KRASG12C(OFF) target, which is inherently limited by the turnover rate of RAS(ON) to RAS(OFF) forms. In contrast, consistent with its direct effect on KRASG12C(ON) proteins, disruption of RAS-RAF interaction was observed to be nearly instantaneous in cells exposed to RMC-6291 (Figure 2). 
 Figure 2. RMC-6291 drove immediate termination of RAS signaling in tumor cell line. 
 
Cellular characterization of the disruption of interaction between KRASG12C and the RAS binding domain, or RBD, of CRAF by KRASG12C(OFF) inhibitors AMG 510 and MRTX849, and the KRASG12C(ON) inhibitor RMC-6291. An engineered NanoBRET system was used in U2OS cells with a nanoluciferase-KRASG12C fusion and HaloTag-CRAF RBD fusion labeled with Halo618. 100% interaction is defined by the BRET signal before addition of inhibitors. Results of a single experiment are shown, and are representative of results from three independent experiments. 
 Oral administration of RMC-6291 produced deep and durable suppression of RAS pathway activity in KRASG12C tumor models and drove profound tumor regressions in vivo at well-tolerated doses. Across multiple tumor xenograft models, we observed that RMC-6291 at equivalent, and sometimes lower, doses outperformed selected KRASG12C(OFF) inhibitors by driving deeper and more durable anti-tumor effects (Figures 3-4).

RMC-6236 
 RMC-6236, our first RASMULTI(ON) inhibitor development candidate, is also in the IND-enabling stage of preclinical development and we currently plan to submit an IND for this drug candidate in the first half of 2022. RMC-6236 is designed as a first-in-class, potent, oral, RAS-selective tri-complex inhibitor of multiple RAS(ON) variants including KRASG12V(ON) and KRASG12D(ON). In preclinical studies, it exhibited low nanomolar inhibition of both RAS pathway signaling and growth in RAS-dependent cells and a selectivity window of more than 1,000 times over RAS-independent cells (Figure 5). In addition, RMC-6236 has a drug-like profile, including oral bioavailability across multiple species, based on preclinical results. We believe the results from our preclinical studies evaluating the RMC-6236 support advancement to clinical development.

Cellular characterization of the effect of RMC-6291 on the proliferation of a variety of RAS-dependent and RAS-independent cell lines in preclinical studies. Cell proliferation was monitored in 2D cell cultures using CellTiter-Glo (CTG). Data shown represent the mean of at least two independent preclinical studies, each performed in duplicate (error bars show the standard deviation). 
 We believe the preclinical results for RMC-6236 show that this product candidate has the potential to treat patients whose cancers harbor a range of RAS variants. First, RMC-6236 may have the potential to be used to treat cancers driven by RAS variants for which we believe a mutant-selective inhibitor is unlikely to be discovered based on the properties of the mutated amino acid side chains, such as the very common KRASG12V (Figure 6). In this context, oral administration of RMC-6236 was observed to produce deep and durable suppression of RAS pathway activity in a KRASG12V tumor model and to have driven profound tumor regressions in vivo at well-tolerated doses in NSCLC colorectal and pancreatic KRASG12V tumor models in mice (Figures 7-9). RMC-6236 may also be useful for targeting RAS variants for which we believe mutant-selective inhibitors are likely to be discovered in the future, such as KRASG12D. In a pancreatic cancer tumor xenograft model with the KRASG12D variant, oral administration of RMC-6236 drove profound tumor regressions (Figure 10). Across all tumor models presented in Figures 8-10, RMC-6236 was well-tolerated at the dose regimens shown. In our preclinical evaluation, RMC-6236 exhibited significant anti-tumor activity at well-tolerated doses in murine tumor models.

In (upper right) each animal is represented as a separate bar. Numbers indicate number of complete regressions (CR, defined as ≥ 80% reduction in tumor volume from initial volume) in each group. po = per os (oral administration), qd = daily and q2d = every other day. 
 KRASG12V and KRASG12D are the two most common RAS variants implicated in driving human cancers and together are believed to cause almost 100,000 new cases of cancer each year in the US alone. Beyond direct targeting of numerous RAS(ON) mutants, we believe RMC-6236 has the potential, if approved, to be used to treat cancers driven by wild type RAS, such as those in which amplification of wild type RAS drives cancer growth. Along similar lines, we believe RMC-6236 has the potential to be deployed in combination with other RAS pathway inhibitors to combat various resistance mechanisms that depend on wild type RAS activation. 
 We have identified potent, cell-active RAS(ON) Inhibitors for variants thought to be responsible for the vast majority of RAS-addicted cancers. Two of these programs, one designed to target KRASG13C(ON) selectively and one designed to target KRASG12D(ON) selectively, are currently in the lead optimization stage of preclinical development. 
 RAS Companion Inhibitors 
 Our RAS Companion Inhibitor RMC-4630 is designed as a potent and selective inhibitor of SHP2. The clinical development program for RMC-4630 currently consists of four active clinical trials, one of which includes two arms studying different combinations: 

• | RMC-4630-01, a Phase 1 study of RMC-4630 as monotherapy in relapsed and refractory solid tumors;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | RMC-4630-02, a Phase 1b/2 study which includes an arm studying RMC-4630 in combination with the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib (Cotellic®) in relapsed and refractory solid tumors and an arm studying RMC-4630 in combination with the EGFR inhibitor osimertinib (Tagrisso®) in EGFR-positive locally advanced and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an Amgen-sponsored Phase 1b study of RMC-4630 in combination with Amgen’s KRASG12C(OFF) inhibitor, AMG 510 or sotorasib in subjects with advanced solid tumors harboring the KRASG12C mutation; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a Sanofi-sponsored Phase 1 study of RMC-4630 in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab (Keytruda®) in subjects with advanced malignancies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We also anticipate that RMC-4630 will be studied in combination with: 
  
• | an ERK inhibitor in patients with pancreatic cancer as part of an investigator sponsored study planned by Netherlands Cancer Institute; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an emerging asset targeting KRASG12C(OFF) from AstraZeneca’s portfolio in a study planned by AstraZeneca.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under our collaboration with Sanofi on RMC-4630, we have a 50-50 profit share and a co-promote right in the United States and are eligible to receive royalties on net sales outside of the United States. Sanofi is responsible for reimbursing substantially all of our research costs and all of our development costs for RMC-4630. 
 RMC-4630-01 
 RMC-4630-01 is an ongoing Phase 1 study in patients with advanced cancers, including those with tumors harboring genetically defined mutations in the RAS signaling pathway, that is evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of RMC-4630 as a single agent at the recommended phase 2 dose and schedule (RP2DS) of 200 mg administered on Day 1 and Day 2 (D1D2) weekly. Data from the RMC-4630-01 study suggest that an intermittent dosing strategy for RMC-4630 both exceeds target plasma exposure (apoptotic threshold) based on preclinical models of RAS pathway-driven cancers that project potential clinical activity and facilitates low levels of target plasma exposure (cytostatic threshold) later in the dosing interval to potentially allow normal tissue to recover. We are evaluating this dose and schedule in an expansion cohort of the RMC-4630-01 study, consisting of patients with gynecologic tumors harboring NF1LOF mutations, in addition to a small safety/tolerability cohort representing a broader set of histotypes and RAS pathway genotypes. We currently expect to report a dose escalation safety data set for this trial in the first half of 2021. 
 As of the data cut-off on May 4, 2020, we reported the following preliminary data from RMC-4630-01: 
 In RMC-4630-01, 87 patients had been enrolled and had received study drug and were evaluable for safety: 38 patients received an intermittent schedule (Tables 1 and 2) and the remainder on the daily schedule. 
 Interim safety and tolerability – intermittent dosing schedules 
 31 patients have been dosed with the intermittent weekly D1D4 schedule and 7 patients have been dosed with the weekly D1D2 schedule. Across both intermittent schedules 38 patients have been evaluated for safety after a median RMC-4630 exposure of 1.8 months (range 0.2-10.6 months). Demographic and baseline characteristics information is shown in Table 1.

 Data as of May 4, 2020. 
 The emerging safety profile of RMC-4630 when dosed on an intermittent schedule is consistent with the mechanistic effects of the product candidate on SHP2 and hence the RAS signaling cascade, including edema, gastrointestinal toxicity, reduced red cell production (low hemoglobin concentration and worsening of pre-existing anemia), reduced platelet production (thrombocytopenia), hypertension and fatigue. This safety profile was largely predictable from preclinical studies and clinical studies of other well-known inhibitors of this pathway. 
 Treatment-related adverse events, or related AEs, occurring in greater than or equal to 10% of patients are listed in Table 2. One grade 4 treatment-related AE of thrombocytopenia has been reported in a patient receiving 240 mg twice weekly on D1D4. No related grade 5 AEs have been reported.

 Four patients (11%) had serious adverse events, or SAEs, thought to be possibly or probably related to the study drug as assessed by the trial sponsor across all intermittent dosing cohorts. Three SAEs were reported among three patients receiving 200 mg D1D4 (Grade 3 abdominal distention, Grade 3 anemia, Grade 2 deep vein thrombosis, one patient each). Four SAEs were reported in one patient receiving 240 mg D1D4 (pleural effusion, pulmonary embolism, nausea, and vomiting, all Grade 3). 
 Three additional SAEs across three patients (cerebrovascular accident, multifocal pneumonia, and pleural effusion) were reported in which the investigator was unable to rule out an association with the study drug, but where the evidence for causality by RMC-4630 was absent or considered unlikely by the study sponsor. One patient presented symptoms five days after starting study drug where a total of two doses were administered. This patient had major risk factors for developing a cerebrovascular accident including underlying bladder cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, recent major thromboembolic event of pulmonary embolism less than two months prior to start of study treatment, elderly age, history of coronary artery calcification, smoking and hypertension. A second patient had pneumonia which is not an expected event for RMC-4630. After taking two doses of study drug, patient was hospitalized due to suspicion of post-obstructive pneumonia which was later updated to multifocal pneumonia. No pathogens were identified from the infection work-up. Given the history of lung cancer, the sponsor considers this event unlikely related to RMC-4630. A third patient had NSCLC and a history of multiple pleural effusions (including prior to starting study treatment) with multiple thoracentesis performed. Given patient history and the rapid accumulation of pleural fluid after the drug was held, the sponsor believes that this 
 14

event is most likely due to underlying disease progression and is unlikely related to RMC-4630. No grade 4 or 5 related SAEs have been reported in either intermittent cohort. 
 The RMC-4630-01 study has provided preliminary evidence that RMC-4630 has single agent anti-tumor activity in KRASMUTANT NSCLC and in NF1LOF tumors. As of May 4, 2020, seven patients with KRASG12C NSCLC had follow-up CT scans of target lesions. Among them, one had partial response, five had stable disease, and one had disease progression (Figure 11); three patients had not reported follow-up measurements of target lesions, of which one has been recorded as best response of stable disease and two of progressive disease. Disease control rate, or DCR, the sum of best response of partial response and stable disease cases for patients with KRASG12C NSCLC as of the extract date was 7/10 (70%). 
 For all patients with KRASMUTANT NSCLC, DCR was 17/29 (59%) (Figure 12). One patient with KRASG12V NSCLC was on treatment for 16.3 months with stable disease (and approximately 15% reduction in tumor volume) as of the cut-off date. 
 In histotypes other than NSCLC, the best response for tumors harboring a KRAS mutation, as of the cut-off date, was stable disease.

Data are presented for the efficacy evaluable population (N=29) defined as participants with baseline and at least one post-baseline scan or who died or had clinical progression prior to first post-baseline scan. Five patients are not represented in this figure: 1 patient had death due to clinical progression prior to first scan, 1 patient did not have measurements for one of the target lesions but progressed developing new lesion, and 3 patients had missing tumor measurements in the database at the time of data extract. PD = progressive disease; SD = stable disease; PR = partial response; PD, SD, and PR each per RECIST 1.1. 
 Single agent activity of RMC-4630 has also been reported in two patients with tumors harboring NF1LOF mutations. One patient, a 63 year old female with a poorly differentiated uterine carcinosarcoma, had a complete response. This patient was diagnosed in October 2017 with a tumor harboring two NF1LOF mutations, a POLE (DNA repair) mutation, and ultra-high tumor mutational burden. The patient had received two treatment regimens prior to starting RMC-4630. She started RMC-4630 200 mg D1D4 in December 2019 and was subsequently reduced to 140 mg D1D4 due to gastrointestinal toxicity. At two months, her tumor dimension had reduced from 1.7 cm to undetectable. A complete response was subsequently confirmed in March 2020 and she continued in complete response as of her last scan in October 2020. 
 A second patient with NSCLC harboring a co-existing NF1LOF and KRASG12C had tumor shrinkage (Figure 13).

 RMC-4630-02 
 RMC-4630-02 is a Phase 1b/2 study of RMC-4630 that includes an arm studying RMC-4630 in combination with the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib in patients with advanced cancers that harbor mutations in the RAS signaling pathway. The study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiles of RMC-4630 and cobimetinib under two different dose administration schedules for each agent. We currently expect to provide preliminary safety and clinical activity data for this combination in expansion cohorts in KRASMUTANT colorectal cancer in 2022. 
 We reported interim data from this ongoing study in a plenary session at the EORTC-NCI-AACR 32nd Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics (ENA 2020). These interim data as of September 21, 2020 provide preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity in patients with colorectal cancer driven by KRAS mutations (Figure 14). 
 Interim results also suggest that a dual intermittent dosing strategy for RMC-4630 and cobimetinib exceeds target plasma exposures for each compound based on preclinical models of RAS pathway-driven cancers that project potential clinical activity (Figure 15). The adverse event profile of the combination, which was consistent with expected on-pathway effects of both drugs, was tolerable under the dual intermittent dosing schedule.

 We have selected the recommended dose and schedule for this combination (RMC-4630 140 mg and cobimetinib 40 mg administered on a D1D2 weekly schedule), and are evaluating this combination at this dose and schedule in expansion cohorts in the RMC-4630-02 study in patients with colorectal cancer harboring KRASG12V or KRASG12D mutations and others drawing from a broader set of histotypes and RAS pathway genotypes. 
 The EGFR inhibitor arm of RMC-4630-02 is evaluating RMC-4630 in combination with the EGFR inhibitor osimertinib (Tagrisso®) in patients with EGFR positive NSCLC. The arm is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of RMC-4630 and osimertinib with different doses of RMC-4630, administered on a D1D2 weekly schedule, with the approved dose of osimertinib. Overlapping on-pathway toxicities with the combination of RMC-4630 and osimertinib were anticipated and have been observed. As with MEK inhibitors, many EGFR inhibitors are less selective for a mutated cancer driver than are targeted inhibitors for other drivers, such as AMG 510 (sotorasib) for KRASG12C, and thus the combination of EGFR antagonists with SHP2 inhibitors presents a potential clinical development challenge. We continue to enroll patients in the osimertinib combination study for evaluation of safety and tolerability. We currently expect to release initial tolerability and pharmacokinetic data for the RMC-4630 and osimertinib combination in the second half of 2021. In the future, we may consider evaluating RMC-4630 in combination with other receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors, which we believe may have less potential for overlapping toxicities. 
 Additional clinical studies with RMC-4630 
 RMC-4630 is also being evaluated by Amgen in combination with its investigational KRASG12C(OFF) agent AMG 510 (sotorasib) as an arm of Amgen’s CodeBreaK 101 study. We believe that the mechanism of action and preclinical data that we have observed provide a viable rationale for this study. We currently expect that a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule for further testing of this combination will be selected in the first half of 2021 and that preliminary clinical activity data will be provided in the second half of 2021. 
 RMC-4630 is being evaluated by Sanofi in Phase 1 study in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab (Keytruda®). We believe that the mechanism of action and preclinical data that we have observed provide a viable rationale for this study. Sanofi is currently enrolling patients in this study, and we expect currently that a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule will be selected in the first half of 2021. 
 The Pancreatic Cancer Collective (a strategic partnership between Lustgarten Foundation and Stand Up To Cancer) has awarded funding to the Netherlands Cancer Institute, or the NKI, for its study using our SHP2 inhibitor, RMC-4630 in combination with an investigational ERK inhibitor (LY3214996) in patients with pancreatic cancer. We plan to provide RMC-4630 to support this investigator-sponsored study. 
 In addition, AstraZeneca plans to evaluate RMC-4630 in combination with an emerging asset targeting KRASG12C(OFF) from AstraZeneca’s portfolio. 
 RMC-5552 
 Our RAS Companion Inhibitor RMC-5552 is designed as a selective inhibitor of hyperactivated mTORC1 signaling in tumors. We plan to evaluate RMC-5552 as monotherapy, as well as in combination with RAS inhibitors for patients with cancers harboring a RAS mutation and co-occurring mutations in the mTOR signaling pathway. We submitted an IND to the FDA for RMC-5552, and the 
 18

associated clinical study has been authorized to proceed. Our Phase 1 study to evaluate RMC-5552 as a monotherapy is not yet recruiting, however site initiation is underway. We currently expect to start dosing patients with this drug candidate in the first half of 2021 and to report initial safety, pharmacokinetic and activity data for this compound as a single agent in 2022. 
 mTORC1 is a critical regulator of metabolism, growth and proliferation within cells, including cancer cells. The abnormal activation of mTORC1, and subsequent inactivation of the tumor suppressor 4EBP1, is a mechanism that is frequently harnessed by cancer cells to gain a growth and proliferation advantage over normal cells. RMC-5552, is designed to selectively and deeply inhibit mTORC1, thereby preventing phosphorylation and inactivation of 4EBP1, a downstream protein in the mTOR signaling pathway that normally suppresses expression of certain oncogenes such as C-MYC. mTORC1-selective inhibitors from our proprietary series, including RMC-5552, have been shown to have combinatorial activity with KRASG12C inhibitors in preclinical models of KRASG12C lung and colon cancer, suggesting that RMC-5552 is a meaningful and rational addition to our portfolio of RAS Companion Inhibitors. 
 RMC-5845 
 Our RAS Companion Inhibitor RMC-5845 is designed as a selective inhibitor of SOS1. RMC-5845 is in IND-enabling development and we currently plan to submit an IND for this candidate in the second half of 2021. 
 RMC-5845 targets SOS1, a protein that plays a key role in converting RAS(OFF) to RAS(ON) in cells. SOS1 directly activates RAS proteins by promoting the release of the bound GDP and thereby facilitating the binding of GTP, which is present within a cell in great excess to GDP, to generate RAS(ON). Therefore, we believe that inhibition of SOS1 may represent a viable approach for targeting RAS-driven tumors. 
 Commercial plan 
 We intend to retain significant development and commercialization rights to our product candidates and, if marketing approval is obtained, to commercialize our product candidates on our own, or potentially with a partner, in the United States and other regions. Our most advanced product candidate, RMC-4630, is the subject of a global collaboration with Sanofi. Unless otherwise delegated to us by the joint commercialization committee, Sanofi has the sole right and responsibility for all aspects of the commercialization of SHP2 inhibitors in the world for any and all uses, at its expense, subject to our right to elect to co-promote SHP2 inhibitors in the United States. In the United States, we will share equally with Sanofi the profits and losses applicable to commercialization of SHP2 inhibitor products. Sanofi is responsible for manufacturing SHP2 inhibitors for commercial supply and is expected to lead commercialization efforts through a joint commercialization committee representing the partners. We currently have no sales, marketing or commercial product distribution capabilities. We intend to build the necessary infrastructure and capabilities over time for the United States, and potentially other regions, following further advancement of our product candidates. Clinical data, the size of the addressable patient population, the size of the commercial infrastructure and manufacturing needs, and the status of our pipeline, may all influence or alter our commercialization plans. 
 Collaboration agreement with Sanofi 
 In June 2018, we entered into a collaborative research, development and commercialization agreement with Aventis, Inc. (an affiliate of Sanofi), or the Sanofi Agreement, to research and develop SHP2 inhibitors, including RMC-4630, for any indications. The Sanofi Agreement was assigned to Genzyme Corporation, a Sanofi affiliate, in December 2018. For the purposes of this discussion, we refer to Genzyme Corporation as Sanofi. Pursuant to the Sanofi Agreement, we granted Sanofi a worldwide, exclusive, sublicensable (subject to our consent in certain circumstances) license under certain of our patents and know-how to research, develop, manufacture, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise commercialize SHP2 inhibitors, including RMC-4630, for any and all uses, subject to our exercise of rights and performance of obligations under the Sanofi Agreement. Such intellectual property exclusively licensed to Sanofi includes our interest under any of our solely-owned or jointly-owned inventions arising out of activities undertaken pursuant to the development of SHP2 inhibitor product candidates under the Sanofi Agreement. 
 Under the Sanofi Agreement, we have primary responsibility for early clinical development of RMC-4630 pursuant to a development plan that is currently approved through 2021. The development plan and budget beyond 2021 will be determined by a joint research and development committee, over which Sanofi has final decision-making power subject to certain exceptions. Sanofi is responsible to reimburse us for all internal and external costs and expenses to perform our activities under approved development plans. We are responsible for the manufacture of SHP2 inhibitors for Phase 1 and non-registrational Phase 2 clinical trials at Sanofi’s cost, while Sanofi is responsible for manufacturing SHP2 inhibitors for all other clinical trials and commercial supply. Sanofi has the sole right and responsibility to perform all regulatory activities under the Sanofi Agreement, except with respect to certain trials conducted by us or otherwise conducted under our IND, including our current clinical trials evaluating RMC-4630. Once we have completed all clinical trials for a product candidate that are assigned to us under a development plan, all regulatory approvals for such product candidate are automatically assigned to Sanofi. 
 We are also primarily responsible for performing preclinical research on SHP2 inhibitors, pursuant to a research plan that is currently approved through 2021. The research plan and budget beyond 2021 will be determined by a joint research and development committee, over which Sanofi has final decision-making power subject to certain exceptions. Sanofi is responsible to reimburse us for 
 19

all internal and external costs and expenses incurred to perform activities under approved research plans, with the exception of internal and external research costs and expenses under approved research plans for 2019 and 2020, for which Sanofi is obligated to reimburse us for 80% of such costs. We are responsible for 20% of all internal and external research costs incurred under the research plans for 2019 and 2020. Sanofi is responsible to reimburse us for all internal and external costs and expenses incurred under the research plan for 2021. 
 Unless otherwise delegated to us by the joint commercialization committee, Sanofi also has the sole right and responsibility for all aspects of the commercialization of SHP2 inhibitors in the world for any and all uses, at its expense, subject to our right to elect to co-promote SHP2 inhibitors in the United States. Sanofi is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to seek marketing approval for at least one SHP2 inhibitor product candidate in certain major market countries. Sanofi agrees to provide us, and we agree to provide Sanofi, with research, development and commercialization updates through the joint committees. 
 During the term of the Sanofi Agreement, we may not, alone or with any affiliate or third party, conduct certain research activities with respect to, or develop or commercialize, any product that contains a SHP2 inhibitor outside of the Sanofi Agreement. 
 Pursuant to the Sanofi Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $50 million from Sanofi in July 2018. Upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones, Sanofi will be obligated to pay us up to $520 million in the aggregate, including up to $235 million upon the achievement of specified development milestones and up to $285 million upon achievement of certain marketing approval milestones. In the United States, we will share equally with Sanofi the profits and losses applicable to commercialization of SHP2 inhibitor products, pursuant to a profit/loss share agreement that the parties will negotiate based on key terms agreed in the Sanofi Agreement. On a product-by-product basis, Sanofi will also be required to pay us tiered royalties on annual net sales of each product outside the United States ranging from high single digit to mid-teen percentages. The royalty payments are subject to reduction under specified conditions set forth in the Sanofi Agreement. Subject to certain exceptions, the royalties are payable on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the latest of the expiration of all valid claims covering such product in such country contained in the patents licensed to Sanofi under the Sanofi Agreement and the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such product in such country. 
 Sanofi has the sole and exclusive right to file, prosecute and maintain any patents licensed to it pursuant to the Sanofi Agreement, as well as to enforce infringement of or defend claims against such patents that relate to SHP2 inhibitor products. 
 
Unless terminated earlier, the Sanofi Agreement will continue in effect until the later of the expiration of all of Sanofi’s milestone and royalty payment obligations and the expiration of the profit/loss share agreement. Upon expiration of the Sanofi Agreement, the licenses granted to Sanofi thereunder shall become fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable. Sanofi may terminate the Sanofi Agreement in its entirety or on a country-by-country or product-by-product basis for any reason or for significant safety concerns, upon prior notice to us within certain specified time periods. Sanofi may terminate the Sanofi Agreement in its entirety upon our change of control, with prior notice. Either party may terminate the Sanofi Agreement if an undisputed material breach by the other party is not cured within a defined period of time, or immediately upon notice for insolvency-related events of the other party. We may terminate the Sanofi Agreement after a certain number of years if Sanofi develops a competing program without commencing a registrational clinical trial for a SHP2 inhibitor product candidate, and subject to certain other conditions. We may also terminate the Sanofi Agreement at any time, if Sanofi ceases certain critical activities for SHP2 inhibitor product candidates for more than a specified period of time, provided that such cessations of critical activity were not a result of certain specified factors, and subject to certain other conditions. Upon any termination of the Sanofi Agreement with respect to any product or country, all licenses to Sanofi with respect to such product or country shall automatically terminate and all rights generally revert back to us. If the Sanofi Agreement is terminated, in its entirety or with respect to a product, other than by us for Sanofi’s material breach or insolvency, we may be required to pay Sanofi royalties on worldwide net sales of reverted products up to mid-single digit percentages based on the development and regulatory status of such reverted products, in each case subject to reductions in accordance with the terms of the Sanofi Agreement. 
 Acquisition of Warp Drive 
 In October 2018, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger pursuant to which we acquired all outstanding shares of Warp Drive. In connection with the acquisition, we issued 6,797,915 shares of our Series B preferred stock and provided $0.9 million in other consideration, for total consideration valued at $69.0 million. The Agreement and Plan of Merger contained representations, warranties and covenants by, among and for the benefit of the parties, as well as mutual indemnification obligations. 
Manufacturing 
 We rely on and will continue to rely on our contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for both drug substance and drug product. Currently, all of our manufacturing is outsourced to well-established third-party manufacturers. We have entered into contracts with CMOs for production of RMC-4630 and RMC-5552 drug substance and drug product for our clinical trials and IND-enabling development studies, respectively, and plan to enter into additional contracts with these or other manufacturers for additional supply. 
 20

Our outsourced approach to manufacturing relies on CMOs to first develop manufacturing processes that are compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, then produce material for preclinical and clinical studies. Our agreements with CMOs may obligate them to develop and qualify upstream and downstream processes, develop drug product process, validate (and in some cases develop) suitable analytical methods for test and release as well as stability testing, produce drug substance for preclinical testing, produce cGMP-compliant drug substance, or produce cGMP-compliant drug product. We, and Sanofi, conduct audits of CMOs prior to initiation of activities under these agreements and monitor operations to ensure compliance with the mutually agreed process descriptions and to cGMP regulations. 
 Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and the oncology sector, are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition and strong defense of intellectual property rights. While we believe that our discovery programs, technology, knowledge, experience, and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others. 
 Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with currently approved therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Key product features that would affect our ability to effectively compete with other therapeutics include the efficacy, safety and convenience of our products and the ease of use and effectiveness of any complementary diagnostics and/or companion diagnostics. 
 There is a large number of companies developing or marketing treatments for cancer, including many major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. These treatments consist of small molecule drug products, biologics, cell-based therapies and traditional chemotherapy. There are also several programs in development targeting SHP2, including those clinical programs run by Novartis AG, Jacobio Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd. (licensed to AbbVie Inc.), Relay Therapeutics, Inc. (licensed to Roche) and Erasca, Inc. There are several RAS pathway mutations programs, including those directed at KRASG12C(OFF) and KRASG12D mutations, including clinical programs directed at KRASG12C(OFF) being conducted by Amgen Inc., Mirati Therapeutics, Inc. and Roche. Other clinical programs directed at mutant RAS are being conducted by Merck & Co./Moderna Therapeutics, Boehringer Ingelheim and Gilead Sciences, Inc. Smaller and other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors. In addition, academic research departments and public and private research institutions may be conducting research on compounds that could prove to be competitive. 
 The availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products. Our competitors also may obtain FDA, or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. 
 Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 Intellectual property 
 Our success depends in part on our ability and the ability of our collaborators to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our technology, programs, and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, in particular, our patent rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of others. We endeavor to establish, maintain and enforce intellectual property rights that protect our business interests. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application, assuming the patent has not been terminally disclaimed over a commonly-owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor, or over a patent not commonly owned but that was disqualified as prior art as the result of activities undertaken within the scope of a joint research agreement. In the United States, the term of a patent may also be eligible for patent term adjustment for delays within the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO. In addition, for patents that cover an FDA-approved drug, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, may permit a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. While the length of such patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review, patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent per approved drug may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek any 
 21

available patent term extension to any issued patents we may be granted in any jurisdiction where such extensions are available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions. 
 We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, and confidential information relating to our programs to develop and maintain our proprietary position, and seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of such items to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not presently consider appropriate for, patent protection. Our trade secrets include, for example, certain program specific syntheses, manufacturing schema, formulations, biomarkers, patient selection strategies, and certain aspects of our proprietary tri-complex technology platform. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements prior to the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us, and for employees, contractors and consultants to enter into invention assignment agreements with us. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Where applicable, the agreements provide that all inventions to which the individual contributed as an inventor shall be assigned to us, and as such, will become our property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will be self-executing or otherwise provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets or other proprietary information, including in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our trade secrets and confidential information by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in the measures we take to protect and preserve our trade secrets, such measures can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.

The issued patents have, and any patents issuing from these patent applications would have, nominal expiration dates ranging from 2031 (for patents originating from the Warp Drive Bio portfolio) to 2039 (for patents originating from the Company’s portfolio), without accounting for any applicable patent term adjustments or extensions. 
 Government regulation 
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, marketing and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of products, such as those we are developing. 
 22

The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 U.S. drug regulation 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug can be marketed in the United States. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA clinical holds, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. 
 The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies, where all supporting safety and toxicity studies are performed in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | manufacture of clinical drug supply in accordance with FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, regulations, when required;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before a clinical study may be initiated;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the application for review;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility(ies) where the product is manufactured to assess compliance with cGMP regulations, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCP;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of users fees for FDA review of the NDA; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of an NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for its particular labeled uses in the United States.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical and clinical studies 
 The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process can take many years and the actual time required to obtain approval, if any, may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or condition being treated. 
 Preclinical tests include laboratory (in vitro) evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal (in vivo) studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of preclinical tests that provide safety and toxicological information must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) and any available human data or literature to support use of the product in humans. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before clinical trials may begin. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
 The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical studies. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical studies can begin. 
 For each successive clinical trial conducted with the investigational drug, a separate, new protocol submission to an existing IND must be made, along with any subsequent changes to the investigational plan. Sponsors are also subject to ongoing reporting requirements, including submission of IND safety reports for any serious adverse experiences associated with use of the investigational drug or findings from preclinical studies suggesting a significant risk for human subjects, as well as IND annual reports on the progress of the investigations conducted under the IND. 
 23

Clinical studies involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for participation in each clinical study. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical study and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical study site’s IRB before a study may be initiated at the site, and the IRB must monitor the study until completed. Sponsors of clinical trials generally must register and report ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries, including the website maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, ClinicalTrials.gov. 
 Human clinical trials are typically divided into three or four phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. 
  
• | Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or into patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to evaluate tolerance and optimal dose, identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks, and preliminarily evaluate efficacy. Multiple Phase 2 trials may be conducted to obtain additional data prior to beginning Phase 3 trials. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites to generate enough data to statistically evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical studies after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical studies after approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical studies. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA, the IRB or the clinical study sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. The sponsor may also suspend or terminate a clinical study based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional in vivo studies and develop additional information about the characteristics of the product candidate. Companies must also finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercially applicable quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, must use validated methods for testing the product against specifications to confirm its identity, strength, quality and purity. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 
U.S. review and approval process 
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of preclinical studies and other non-clinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies. 
 An NDA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. 
 The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs before it accepts them for filing. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to payment of additional user fees. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Under applicable Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, performance goals, the FDA endeavors to review applications subject to standard review within ten to twelve months, and to review applications subject to priority review within six to eight months, depending on whether the drug is a new molecular entity. 
 24

The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that relevant study data was obtained in compliance with GCP requirements. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information, including additional clinical trials or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to the clinical trials, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA may ultimately decide that an application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, as a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, program to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. If the FDA determines a REMS program is necessary during review of the application, the drug sponsor must agree to the REMS plan at the time of approval. A REMS program may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the drug’s risks, or other elements to assure safe use, such as limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. In addition, all REMS programs must include a timetable to periodically assess the strategy following implementation. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. 
 Further, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety and efficacy, and the FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. Moreover, changes to the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities may require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the changes can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that supporting the original approval, and the FDA uses similar procedures in reviewing supplements as it does in reviewing original applications. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing development programs. 
 Expedited development and review programs 
 The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates, and we may seek one or more of these programs for our current or future products. 
 New drug products may be eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product has opportunities for frequent interactions with the review team during product development and, once an NDA is submitted, the product may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. 
 A product intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product, including involvement of senior managers. 
 
25

After an NDA is submitted for a product, including a product with a fast track designation and/or breakthrough therapy designation, the NDA may be eligible for priority review. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition compared to marketed products. Depending on whether a drug contains a new molecular entity, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take an action on the marketing application within six to eight months of the 60-day filing date, compared with ten to twelve months under standard review. 
 Additionally, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. The FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or an indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, sponsor fails to conduct the confirmatory trial in a timely manner, or if the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
 Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the scientific or medical standards for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval, though they may expedite the development or review process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. 
 Orphan drug designation 
 We intend to pursue orphan drug designation for one or more of our product candidates with respect to certain oncology indications, as appropriate, with the potential to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for our products, if approved. 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process. 
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the application user fee. 
 A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
 Pediatric information and pediatric exclusivity 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, certain NDAs and certain supplements to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or iPSP, within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of a Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The iPSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide 
 26

data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the iPSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon iPSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials and/or other clinical development programs. 
 A drug product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study. 
 Post-approval requirements 
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to drug listing and registration, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, adverse event reporting and advertising, marketing and promotion. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. While physicians may prescribe for off-label uses, manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
 After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved NDA. In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced and announced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. The FDA may withdraw approval of a product if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning or untitled letters or holds on clinical studies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | mandated modifications of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 We also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling, known as “off-label use,” industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. 
 The FDA may also require post-approval studies and clinical trials if the FDA finds that scientific data, including information regarding related drugs, deem it appropriate. The purpose of such studies would be to assess a known serious risk or signals of serious risk related to the drug or to identify an unexpected serious risk when available data indicate the potential for a serious risk. The FDA may also require a labeling change if it becomes aware of new safety information that it believes should be included in the labeling of a drug. 
 Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant or manufacturer to, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, 
 27

withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. 
 
International regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we could become subject to a variety of foreign regulations regarding development, approval, commercial sales and distribution of our products if we seek to market our product candidates in other jurisdictions. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional review periods, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
 Other healthcare laws 
 Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation, U.S. federal and state anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, consumer fraud, pricing reporting, data privacy and security, and transparency laws and regulations as well as similar foreign laws in jurisdictions outside the U.S. 
 For example, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any individual or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act and the civil monetary penalties statute. 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal civil and criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the healthcare fraud statute implemented under HIPAA or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (as defined by statute) and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report such information regarding payments and transfers of value provided during the previous year to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, anesthesiology assistants and certified nurse midwives. 
 Similar state and local laws and regulations may also restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by patients themselves; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information or which require tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to physicians, other healthcare providers and entities; and state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, additional reporting obligation, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and individual imprisonment.

Data privacy and security laws 
 Pharmaceutical companies may be subject to U.S. federal and state health information privacy, security and data breach notification laws, which may govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. State laws may be more stringent, broader in scope or offer greater individual rights with respect to protected health information, or PHI, than HIPAA and state laws may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured PHI, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. In addition, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which creates individual privacy rights for California consumers and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal data. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020, and the California Attorney General may bring enforcement actions for violations beginning July 1, 2020. The CCPA has been amended from time to time, and further a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, was approved by California voters in the November 3, 2020 election. Effective starting January 1, 2023, the CPRA will significantly modify the CCPA, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information. The CPRA also creates a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA. It remains unclear what, if any, further modifications will be made to the CCPA or the CPRA or how such legislation will be interpreted. 
 European Union member states, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and other jurisdictions have also adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. In the European Economic Area, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, the collection and use of personal data, including clinical trial data, is governed by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. The GDPR became effective on May 25, 2018, repealing its predecessor directive and increasing responsibility and liability of pharmaceutical companies in relation to the processing of personal data of EU data subjects. The GDPR, together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the EU member states and the United Kingdom governing the processing of personal data, impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze, store, transfer and otherwise process personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. In particular, the GDPR includes obligations and restrictions concerning the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to such individuals, the transfer of personal data out of the EEA or the United Kingdom, security breach notifications, security and confidentiality of the personal data and imposition of substantial potential fines for breaches of the data protection obligations. European data protection authorities may interpret the GDPR and national laws differently and impose additional requirements, which add to the complexity of processing personal data in or from the EEA or United Kingdom. Guidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised. 
 In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued a decision that struck down the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, which provided companies with a mechanism to comply with data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the EU to the United States and additionally called into question the validity of the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses, on which U.S. companies rely to transfer personal data from Europe to the United States and elsewhere. In September 2020, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner issued an opinion that stated it no longer considers the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield adequate for the purposes of personal data transfers from Switzerland to the United States. These developments may result in European data protection regulators applying differing standards for, and requiring ad hoc verification of, transfers of personal data from Europe to the United States. To the extent that we engage in such transfers, if we are unable to implement safeguards to ensure that our transfers are lawful or if any safeguards upon which we rely are invalidated, we will face increased exposure to litigation, regulatory actions, fines, and injunctions against data processing. If we are unable to engage in such transfers because there is no lawful mechanism to do so, the functionality or effectiveness of our products and services may decrease and our marketing efforts, plans and activities may be adversely impacted. 
 Coverage and reimbursement 
 Sales of any pharmaceutical product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any newly approved product. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. As a result, the coverage determination process can require manufacturers to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of a product to each payor separately and can be a time-consuming process, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. 
 In addition, third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for pharmaceutical products and services. The U.S. government and state legislatures have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors are more and more challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical products, in addition to 
 29

questioning their safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product. 
 In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Pharmaceutical products may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products and may also compete with imported foreign products. Furthermore, there is no assurance that a product will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be established even if coverage is available or that the third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect the ability for manufacturers to sell products profitably. 
 Healthcare reform 
 In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States. The ACA contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement adjustments and fraud and abuse changes. Additionally, the ACA increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. 
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, in 2017, Congress enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, which eliminated the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the TJCA, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit affirmed the District Court’s decision that the individual mandate was unconstitutional but remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the case this case, although it is unclear how and when the Supreme Court will rule. It is also unclear how other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact the ACA. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers, which will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 absent additional congressional action. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices.
