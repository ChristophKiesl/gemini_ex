Item 1. Business. 
 Company Overview
Yelp connects people with great local businesses by bringing word of mouth online and providing a platform for businesses and consumers to engage and transact. As of December 31, 2016, our users had contributed approximately 121.0 million cumulative reviews of almost every type of local business, making us the leading local business review site in the United States. 
 Our platform provides value to consumers and businesses alike by connecting consumers with great local businesses at the critical moment when they are deciding where to spend their money. The key strengths of our platform include: 
 
● | Discovery. Our platform is transforming the way people discover local businesses. Each day, millions of consumers visit our website or use our mobile app to find great local businesses to meet their everyday needs. Our strong brand and the quality of our content have enabled us to attract this large audience with relatively low traffic acquisition costs.

● | Engagement. Yelp provides a platform for consumers to share their everyday local business experiences with other consumers by posting reviews, tips, photos and videos, and to engage directly with businesses, through reviews, our Request-A-Quote and Message the Business features, and by completing transactions on the Yelp Platform. Yelp also provides businesses of all sizes with a variety of free and paid services that help them engage with consumers. Businesses can register a business account for free and claim the Yelp business listing page for each of their locations, allowing them to provide additional information about their business and respond to reviews, among other features. 
● | Advertising. Businesses that want to reach our large audience of purchase intent-driven consumers can also pay for premium services to promote themselves through targeted search advertising, discounted offers and further enhancements to their business listing pages. We generate revenue primarily from the sale of advertising on our website and mobile app to businesses. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated net revenue of $713.1 million, representing 30% growth over 2015, a net loss of $4.7 million and adjusted EBITDA of $120.1 million. For information on how we define and calculate adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to net income (loss), see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Annual Report. 
● | Transactions. The Yelp Platform allows consumers to transact with local businesses directly on Yelp through Yelp Eat24, the food ordering and delivery business we acquired in 2015, Yelp Reservations, our online reservations product, and integrations with partners ranging from Shoptiques.com (boutique shopping) to GolfNow (tee time booking) to BloomNation (flower ordering). In addition to providing consumers with a continuous experience from discovery to completion of transactions, the Yelp Platform creates an additional point of consumer engagement for local businesses. 

 At the heart of our business are the vibrant communities of contributors that contribute the content on our platform. These contributors provide rich, firsthand information about local businesses in the form of reviews and ratings, tips, photos and videos. Each review, tip, photo and video expands the breadth and depth of the content on our platform, which drives a powerful network effect: the expanded content draws in more consumers and more prospective contributors. Although measures of our content (including our cumulative review metric) and traffic (including our desktop and mobile unique visitors metrics) do not factor directly into the advertising arrangements we have with our advertising customers, this network effect underpins our ability to deliver clicks and ad impressions to advertisers. Increases in these metrics improve our value proposition to local businesses as they seek easy-to-use and effective advertising solutions. For this reason, we foster and support communities of contributors and make the consumer experience our highest priority.

Of the approximately 121.0 million cumulative reviews our contributors had submitted through December 31, 2016, approximately 85.7 million were recommended and available on business listing pages; approximately 26.9 million were not recommended and available on secondary pages; and approximately 8.4 million had been removed from our platform. Although they do not factor into a businesss overall star rating, we provide access to reviews that are not recommended because they provide additional perspectives and information on reviewed businesses, as well as transparency of the efficacy of our automated recommendation software.
 The reviews contributed to our platform cover a wide set of local business categories, including restaurants, shopping, beauty and fitness, arts, entertainment and events, home and local services, health, nightlife, travel and hotel, auto and other categories. In the charts below, we highlight the breakdown by industry of local businesses that have received reviews on our platform and the breakdown by industry of reviews contributed to our platform through December 31, 2016.

* | The charts above include information based upon all contributed reviews and include some businesses that have received only reviews that are not recommended or have been removed. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that the concentration of reviews in the restaurant and shopping categories in particular is primarily due to the frequency with which individuals visit specific businesses or engage in certain activities versus others. For example, an individual may eat at a restaurant three times in one week or go shopping once a week, but the same individual is unlikely to visit a mechanic, get a haircut or use a home or local service with the same frequency. The top five industry categories accounted for an aggregate of 77% of our advertising revenue (excluding advertising sold by partners) for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, broken down as follows: Home & Local Services, 30%; Restaurants, 15%; Beauty & Fitness, 12%; Health, 11%; and Shopping, 9%. 
 Our Products 
 Advertising
We provide both free and paid business listing products to businesses of all sizes. We also enable businesses to deliver targeted search advertising to large local audiences through our website and mobile app.
 In our filings with the SEC prior to this Annual Report we classified revenue from our local products  consisting of business listing and advertising products that we sold directly to businesses and Yelp Reservations  as local revenue. In order to bring our revenue presentation into closer alignment with the operation of our business, we now classify revenue from all of our business listing and advertising products, including advertising sold by partners, as advertising revenue. As a result, revenue generated through ad resales and monetization of remnant advertising inventory through third-party ad networks is now classified as advertising revenue rather than other services revenue, and revenue from Yelp Reservations, a subscription service, is classified as other services revenue. All disclosures relating to revenue by product have been updated to reflect this revised classification for all periods presented.

Free Online Business Account | We enable businesses to create a free online business account and claim the listing page for each of their business locations. With their free business accounts, businesses can view trends (e.g. statistics and charts of the performance of their pages on our platform), use the Revenue Estimator tool (e.g. to quantify the revenue opportunity Yelp provides), message customers (e.g. by replying to messages or reviews either publicly or privately), update information (e.g. address, hours of operation) and offer Yelp Deals and Gift Certificates (as described below). 
-----------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enhanced Profile | Our enhanced profile solution eliminates ads from a businesss listing page and allows the business to incorporate a video clip or photo slide show on the page. Businesses can also promote a desired transaction of their choosing  such as scheduling an appointment or printing a coupon  directly on their business listing pages with our Call to Action feature. This feature transfers consumers from a businesss listing page to the businesss own website to complete the action. 
Branded Profile | For businesses with ten or more locations, our branded profile solution offers the ability to incorporate a video clip or photo slide show, as well as a Call to Action button, on each locations business listing page. 
Search and Other Ads | We allow businesses to promote themselves as a sponsored search result on our platform and on the listing pages of related businesses. We now sell ads primarily on a per-click basis, though we also offer impression-based ads. 
Ad Resales | We also generate revenue through the resale of our advertising products by certain agencies and partners, such as YP.com, as well as monetization of remnant advertising inventory through third-party ad networks. 

Transactions 
 In addition to our advertising products, we also offer several features and consumer-interactive tools to facilitate transactions between consumers and the local businesses they find on Yelp. We recognize revenue from these sources on a net basis as transactions revenue. 

Yelp Eat24 | Our Yelp Eat24 business generates revenue through arrangements with restaurants in which restaurants pay a commission percentage fee on orders placed through the Yelp Eat24 platform. 
------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yelp Platform | The Yelp Platform allows consumers to transact directly on Yelp through integrations with partners including Nowait, Whittl, and TicketNetwork. Consumers are currently able to check wait times and join waitlists remotely, book spa and salon appointments and purchase event tickets, among many other transaction opportunities, all without leaving Yelp. 
Yelp Deals | Our Yelp Deals product allows local business owners to create promotional discounted deals for their products and services, which are marketed to consumers through our platform. We typically earn a fee based on the discounted price of each deal sold. We process all customer payments and remit to the business the revenue share of any Yelp Deal purchased. 

 4 


Gift Certificates | Our Gift Certificates product allows local business owners to sell full-price gift certificates directly to consumers through their business listing pages. The business chooses the price point to offer (from $10 to $500), and consumers may purchase Gift Certificates denominated in such amounts. We earn a fee based on the amount of the Gift Certificate sold. We process all consumer payments and remit to the business the revenue share of any Gift Certificate purchased. 
------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Brand
Through the end of 2015, we also offered advertising solutions for national brands in the form of display advertisements and brand sponsorships. We phased out these products over the second half of 2015 and redeployed the associated internal resources, including members of our brand sales team, elsewhere within our organization. Due to certain negative trends in the broader market for brand advertising products  in particular, the shift toward programmatic advertising and increasing advertiser demand for products such as video ads that are disruptive to the consumer experience  we believe this decision will provide us with a long-term strategic advantage by allowing us to focus on our core strength of advertising to local businesses and to ensure that we continue to provide a great consumer experience. We recognized revenue from these products as brand revenue through the end of 2015. 
Other Services 
 We generate other revenue through subscription services, licensing payments for access to Yelp data and other non-advertising, non-transaction arrangements, such as certain partnerships. We recognize revenue from these sources as other services revenue. 
 In our filings with the SEC prior to this Annual Report other services revenue consisted of revenue generated through partner arrangements, including resale of our advertising products by certain partners, and monetization of remnant advertising inventory through third-party ad networks. As described above, for all reporting periods presented, revenue generated from resale of our advertising products and monetization of remnant advertising inventory is now classified as advertising revenue rather than other services revenue. In addition, other services revenue now includes revenue generated from our Yelp Reservations product.

Yelp Reservations | We provide restaurants, nightlife and certain other venues with the ability to offer online reservations directly from their Yelp business listing pages through our Yelp Reservations product, which also includes front-of-house management tools. We offer this product as a monthly subscription service. 
-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yelp Knowledge | Our Yelp Knowledge program offers local analytics and insights through access to our historical data, and is available through integrations with companies including Sprinklr, Reputology and Revinate. 
Other Partnerships | Other non-advertising partner arrangements include content licensing.

Our Strategy 
 Our mission is to connect people with great local businesses. We focus on the following key strategies to grow our business, audience of consumers and advertiser base: 

● | Grow Our Communities. As the number of contributors and consumers within Yelp communities continues to grow, we expect our platform to become more widely known and relevant to broader audiences, further driving the growth of reviews, consumers and local business activity. While organic growth driven by our community development efforts continues to be our primary marketing strategy, we began supplementing these efforts with advertising campaigns aimed at increasing consumer awareness of Yelp in 2014. In 2017, we plan to continue investing in marketing to leverage our brand and benefit from these network dynamics and plan to allocate a greater proportion of our advertising budget to performance marketing with the goal of expanding consumer usage, among others. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Increase Engagement. By continuing to develop a feature-rich experience for consumers, we believe we can increase the number of visits and searches per user. We plan to continue to invest in the development of our mobile platform, and our mobile app in particular, to take advantage of the growing number of consumers accessing Yelp through their mobile devices. Our focus will be on providing additional in-app messaging opportunities, refined search options and social features to better facilitate sharing. With mobile users already generating a majority of our new content, we believe that this approach will be an effective driver of the network effect described above. 
● | Expand Our Reach. We will also continue exploring ways to make our content more widely available, including on new and evolving platforms and distribution channels, such as automobile navigation systems, wearable devices and voice-activated home devices. For example, Apples Siri and Amazons Alexa personal assistant programs currently access Yelp content to respond to local search queries.

● | Provide a Great Consumer Experience. We believe that providing a great consumer experience has been and will continue to be critical to growing our business; accordingly, as we explore opportunities to monetize our products, we remain committed to a high standard of user experience. We will not incorporate advertising or other products or solutions that we believe may excessively degrade the user experience and potentially alienate users, even if they might result in increased short-term monetization. We also plan to continue our consumer protection efforts. In 2016, for example, we expanded the municipal hygiene inspection data available on business listing pages and our consumer alerts program. We also supported federal legislation banning gag clause provisions in consumer-form contracts that seek to prevent consumers from writing negative reviews online, which was signed into law as The Consumer Review Fairness Act of 2016. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Focus on Transactions. As of December 31, 2016, we were recognizing advertising revenue from approximately 137.8 thousand advertising and subscription accounts (formerly referred to as local advertising accounts); with approximately 3.4 million businesses on our platform as of that date, we believe there is significant opportunity to increase the number of businesses advertising on Yelp. We believe the continued expansion of our transaction capabilities will not only drive further consumer engagement, but also attract additional business customers. To that end, in 2016, we expanded the number of transactions-enabled businesses and categories, streamlined the checkout process and made our Request-A-Quote feature available to logged-out traffic, allowing millions more consumers to seamlessly connect with merchants and service providers. In 2017, we plan to continue to innovate and explore ways to expand our transactions functionalities, as well as promote our existing capabilities through direct marketing. 
● | Attract More Businesses. In addition to expanding our transactions capabilities, we believe that new business owner products and comprehensive tools to measure the effectiveness of our products will encourage businesses to advertise on our platform. For example, in 2016, we launched new reporting, messaging and advertising-management features for our Yelp for Business Owners app. We will also continue our local business outreach efforts, which include educating local businesses on how Yelp provides value to them as well as engaging with business owners to gain insight into how we can improve our products and services. In 2016, we held our second annual business leader summit, which brought 100 entrepreneurs representing 80 communities in the United States and Canada to our offices for two days of conversation and strategizing, and joined the U.S. Small Business Administrations Technology Coalition to help small businesses better leverage technology by providing digital education and resources. 


● | Broaden Sales Strategy. Our core strength is our advertising business in the United States and Canada. This business has a significant and growing base of revenue, and we plan to continue to pursue initiatives to enhance our opportunity in this area. We have invested, and will continue to invest, aggressively in sales resources, including increases in headcount and initiatives to increase sales force productivity. In addition to growing our established direct sales force, we are broadening our sales strategy to address the revenue opportunity from existing customers, new advertisers and new products. This includes developing new and evolving sales channels, such as our self-serve advertising channel, which provides business owners with convenient options for purchasing our products, and partnerships with select marketing agencies and resellers to provide large and medium-sized advertisers with greater access to our products. We believe these ongoing investments will lead to additional businesses advertising on Yelp. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Expand Our Portfolio of Revenue-Generating Products. We plan to continue to grow and develop products and partner arrangements that provide incremental value to our advertisers and business partners to encourage them to increase their advertising budgets allocated to our platform. In 2016, for example, we began monetizing Yelp data through our Yelp Knowledge program, which offers local analytics and insights through access to our historical data.

Marketing
 Community Management
 We establish Yelp communities through a pre-launch content development phase, followed by a hiring of a Community Manager, leading to review growth and consumer activity, which, at scale, supports our sales efforts to local businesses. We have a team of Community Managers and Community Ambassadors based across the United States, Canada, and, prior to the fourth quarter of 2016, 30 other countries worldwide. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we wound down our marketing activities in markets outside the United States and Canada, where we believe the long-term return on continued investment to be lower than opportunities for Yelp within our core markets.
 Our community management teams primary goals are to support and grow their local communities of contributors, raise brand awareness and engage with their surrounding communities through: 
 
● | planning and executing fun and engaging events for the community, such as parties, outings and activities at restaurants, museums, hotels and other local places of interest; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | getting to know community members and helping them get to know one another to foster an offline community experience that can be transferred online; 
● | promoting Yelp, including guest appearances on local television and radio, and at local events such as concerts and street fairs; and 
● | writing weekly e-mail newsletters to share information with the community about local businesses, events and activities. 

 Through these activities, we believe our community management team helps us increase awareness of our platform and grow avid communities who are willing to contribute content to our platform. These active contributors may be invited to attend sponsored social events, but do not receive compensation for their contributions. This community growth drives the network effect whereby contributed reviews expand the breadth and depth of our content base. This expansion draws an increasing number of consumers to access the content on our platform, thus inspiring new and existing contributors to create additional reviews that can be shared with this growing audience.
 To further illustrate the development of Yelp communities as they scale, we highlight below our review and revenue metrics for three cohorts of Yelp communities in the United States: the Yelp communities that we launched in 2005-2006; the Yelp communities that we launched in 2007-2008; and the Yelp communities that we launched in 2009-2010.

(5) | Year-over-year growth in average advertising revenue compares average advertising revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 with the average advertising revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2015. 

 In general, the Yelp communities in our earlier U.S. community cohorts are more populous than those in later cohorts, and we have already entered many of the largest cities in the United States and Canada. For these and other reasons, launching additional communities may not yield results similar to those of our existing communities. As a result, we continue to believe that development of our existing communities currently provides the greatest opportunity for growth, and plan to focus our community development efforts on existing communities in 2017.
 Advertising
 We have historically focused on organic and viral growth driven by the community development efforts of our community management team, as described above. While community development continues to be our primary marketing strategy, we believe there is significant opportunity to increase our brand awareness and usage through targeted advertising programs. We began selectively testing advertising to consumers in the second half of 2014, and launched our first television advertising campaign in 2015, with the aim of increasing consumer awareness of our brand. We plan to continue investing in various advertising channels in 2017, with a greater portion of our advertising budget allocated to performance advertising with the objectives of increasing app usage, transaction volumes and new business customers. Our marketing expenses may continue to increase if we significantly expand these efforts to attract additional consumers and businesses. 
Sales
 We sell our products directly through our sales force, indirectly through partners and online through our website. Our advertising sales force consisted of 2,450 employees as of December 31, 2016 and is located across our offices in San Francisco, California; Scottsdale, Arizona; New York, New York; and Chicago, Illinois. From 2012 to 2016, we also had sales operations in Europe, including in Dublin, Ireland and Hamburg, Germany. In the fourth quarter of 2016, however, we wound down our sales activities in markets outside the United States and Canada, where we believe the long-term return on continued investment to be lower than opportunities for Yelp within our core markets. 
 Direct Sales. A large majority of our sales force is dedicated to selling our advertising products, with a significantly smaller component responsible for selling Yelp Eat24 and Yelp Reservation products. Sales representatives are primarily responsible for generating qualified sales leads by identifying and contacting businesses through direct engagement, direct marketing campaigns and weekly e-mails to claimed local businesses. Our direct sales force is focused on increasing revenue by adding new customers, and sales representatives are typically compensated on the basis of advertising sold in a given period. 
 Sales Partnerships. Since 2014, we have allowed our partners such as YP.com to sell certain of our advertising products as part of a package with their own advertising products to its advertiser bases. The products covered by these arrangements include our enhanced profile and cost-per-click advertising. We continue to explore additional partnerships for the sale or bundling of our products, as well as with select marketing agencies. 
 Self-Service Ads. Our online, or self-service, sales channel allows businesses to purchase advertising solutions directly from our website. Businesses can purchase performance-based cost-per-click sponsored search advertising directly through this channel. We are continuing to test approaches to this sales channel, including by offering the option of speaking with a sales representative. 
 9

Account Management. While the focus of our sales force has historically been on adding new customers, we also see opportunity to deepen our relationships with existing customers. To this end, our account management team supports existing business advertisers through client success, cross-selling and retention initiatives. Members of our account management team are currently compensated primarily through fixed salaries rather than on commissions.
 Technology
 Product development and innovation are core pillars of our strategy. We aim to delight our users and business partners with our products. We provide our web-based and mobile services using a combination of in-house and third-party technology solutions and products. 

● | Search and Ranking Technology. We leverage the data stored on our platform and our proprietary indexing and ranking techniques to provide our users with contextual, relevant and up-to-date results to their search queries. For example, a consumer desiring environmentally friendly carpet cleaners does not have to call individual cleaners to inquire about their use of chemical-based cleaning solutions. Instead, the consumer can search for environmentally-friendly carpet cleaners on Yelp and discover cleaners with the best service and green cleaning products that serve a specific neighborhood. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Recommendation Software. We employ our proprietary automated recommendation software to analyze and screen all reviews submitted to our platform. We believe our recommendation technology is one of the key contributors to the quality and integrity of the reviews on our platform and the success of our service. See Consumer Protection Efforts below for additional details regarding our recommendation software. 
● | Mobile Solutions. The number of people who access information about local businesses through mobile devices has increased dramatically over the past few years and is expected to continue to increase. We have seen substantial growth in mobile usage, and anticipate that growth in use of our mobile platform will be the driver of our growth for the foreseeable future. Our most engaged users are on our mobile app, making it particularly critical to our continued success. For example, in the quarter ended December 31, 2016, our mobile devices accounted for approximately 73% of all searches and approximately 66% of all ad clicks on our platform, compared to 70% and 63%, respectively, in the quarter ended December 31, 2015. 
 | To take advantage of this trend, we have invested significant resources into the development of our comprehensive mobile platform for consumers supporting the major smartphone operating systems available today, iOS and Android. Over time, we have enhanced the functionality of our mobile platform, such that it provides similar and, in some areas, greater functionality than our website. Some of the innovations we introduced through our mobile platform include check-ins, tips, comments, Nearby and Monocle, our augmented reality feature. More recently, we also launched a mobile app for business owners, designed to make it easier for them to engage with their customers and manage their Yelp profiles. The Yelp for Business Owners app is currently available for iOS and Android. 


● | Advertising Technologies. We use proprietary ad targeting and delivery technologies designed to provide relevant local advertisements. Our proprietary ad delivery system leverages our unique repository of data to provide useful ads to users and high value leads to advertisers. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Infrastructure. Our web and mobile platforms are currently hosted from multiple locations, primarily through Amazon Web Services. We also host parts of our infrastructure within shared data environments in California and Virginia, as well as with third-party leased server providers. Our web and mobile platforms are designed to have high availability, from the Internet connectivity providers we choose, to the servers, databases and networking hardware that we deploy. We design our systems such that the failure of any individual component is not expected to affect the overall availability of our platform. We also leverage other third-party Internet-based (cloud) services such as rich-content storage, map-related services, ad serving and bulk processing. 
● | Network Security. Computer viruses, malware, phishing attacks, denial-of-service and other attacks and similar disruptions from unauthorized use of computer systems have become more prevalent in our industry, have occurred on our systems in the past and we expect them to occur periodically on our systems in the future. For this reason, our platform includes a host of encryption, antivirus, firewall and patch-management technologies designed to help protect and maintain the systems located at data centers as well as other systems and computers across our business.

Consumer Protection Efforts
 Our success depends on our ability to maintain consumer trust in our solutions and in the quality and integrity of the user content and other information found on our platform. We dedicate significant resources to the goal of maintaining and enhancing the quality, authenticity and integrity of the reviews on our platform, primarily through the following methods: 
 Automated Recommendation Software. We use proprietary software to analyze the relevance, reliability and utility of each review submitted to our platform. The software applies the same objective standards to each review based on a wide range of data associated with the review and reviewer, regardless of whether the business being reviewed advertises on Yelp. These objective standards include various measures of relevance, reliability and utility, such as the reviewers type and level of activity with Yelp (which might correspond to the reviewers reliability or suggest reviewer biases) and whether certain reviews originate from related Internet Protocol addresses (which might mean the reviews were submitted by the same person). The results of this analysis can change over time as the software factors in new information, which may result in reviews that were previously recommended becoming not recommended, and reviews that were previously not recommended being restored to recommended status. Reviews that the software deems to be the most useful and reliable are published directly on business listing pages, though neither we nor the software purport to establish whether or not any individual review is authentic. As of December 31, 2016, our software was recommending approximately 71% of the reviews submitted to our platform. Reviews that are not recommended are published on secondary pages and do not factor into a businesss overall star rating. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 22% of the reviews submitted to our platform were not recommended but still accessible on our platform. 
 Sting Operations. We routinely conduct sting operations to identify businesses and individuals who offer or receive cash, discounts or other benefits in exchange for reviews. For example, we may respond to advertisements offering to pay for reviews that are posted on Craigslist, Facebook and other platforms. We also receive and investigate tips from our users about potential paid reviews. If we identify or confirm any such issues through our investigations, we typically pursue one or more of the courses of action described below (each of which we may also employ on a stand-alone basis). 
 Consumer Alerts Program. We issue consumer alert warnings on business listing pages from time to time when we encounter suspicious activity that we believe is indicative of attempts to deceive or mislead consumers. For example, we may issue a consumer alert if we encounter a business attempting to purchase favorable reviews, or if a large number of favorable reviews are submitted from the same Internet Protocol address. Consumer alerts generally remain in effect for 90 days, or longer if the deceptive practices continue. 
 Coordination with Law Enforcement. We regularly cooperate with law enforcement and consumer protection agencies to investigate and identify businesses and individuals who may be engaged in false advertising or deceptive business practices relating to reviews. For example, in 2013, we assisted the New York Attorney General with Operation Clean Turf, an undercover investigation targeting review manipulation that resulted in 19 companies agreeing to pay more than $350,000 in fines to the State of New York. In 2016, in a continuation of this investigation, the New York Attorney General announced settlements with six additional businesses that tried to mislead consumers, resulting in the businesses agreeing to pay fines and to take measures to increase the honesty and transparency of their online reviews. 
 Legal Action. Our terms of service prohibit the buying and selling of reviews, as well as writing fake reviews. In egregious cases, we take legal action against businesses we believe to be engaged in deceptive practices based on these prohibitions. 
 Removal of Reviews. We regularly remove reviews from our platform that we believe violate our terms of service, including, without limitation: fake or defamatory reviews; content that has been bought, sold or traded; threatening, harassing or lewd content, as well as hate speech and other displays of bigotry; and content that violates the rights of any third party or any applicable law. Users can access information about reviews that we have removed for a particular business by clicking on a link on the businesss listing page. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 7% of the reviews submitted to our platform had been removed.

Intellectual Property
 We rely on federal, state, common law and international rights, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property. We control access to our proprietary technology and algorithms by entering into confidentiality and inventions assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, as well as confidentiality agreements with third parties. 
 In addition to these contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of patent, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, service marks and domain names to protect our intellectual property. We pursue the registration of our copyrights, trademarks, service marks and domain names in the United States and in certain locations internationally. Our registration efforts have focused on gaining protection of our trademarks for Yelp and the Yelp burst logo, among others. These marks are material to our business and essential to our brand identity as they enable others to easily identify us as the source of the services offered under these marks. We currently have limited patent protection for our core business, which may make it more difficult to assert certain of our intellectual property rights. For example, the contractual restrictions and trade secrets that protect our proprietary technology and algorithms provide only a limited safeguard against infringement. 
 Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or other countries in which we operate. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Protecting our intellectual property rights is also costly and time consuming. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results. 
 Companies in the Internet, technology and media industries own large numbers of patents and other intellectual property rights, and frequently request license agreements or threaten to enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of such rights. From time to time, we receive notice letters from patent holders alleging that certain of our products and services infringe their patent rights. We are also currently subject to, and expect to face in the future, allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities. As we face increasing competition and as our business grows, we will likely face more claims of infringement. 
 Competition
 The market for information regarding local businesses and advertising is intensely competitive and rapidly changing. We compete for consumer traffic with traditional, offline local business guides and directories as well as online providers of local and web search. We also compete for a share of businesses overall advertising budgets with traditional, offline media companies and other Internet marketing providers. Our competitors include the following types of businesses: 

● | Offline. Competitors include offline media companies and service providers, many of which have existing relationships with businesses. Services provided by competitors range from yellow pages listings to direct mail campaigns to advertising and listing services in local newspapers, magazines, television and radio. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Online. Competitors also include Internet search engines, such as Google and Bing, review and social media websites as well as various other online service providers. These include regional websites that may have strong positions in particular markets. 

 Our competitors may enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, substantially greater market share, established marketing relationships with, and access to, large existing user bases and substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. These companies may use these advantages to offer products similar to ours at a lower price, develop different products to compete with our current solutions and respond more quickly and effectively than we do to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or client requirements. Certain competitors could also use strong or dominant positions in one or more markets to gain competitive advantage against us in markets in which we operate. 
 We compete on the basis of a number of factors. We compete for consumer traffic on the basis of factors including: the reliability of our content; the breadth, depth and timeliness of information; and the strength and recognition of our brand. We compete for businesses advertising budgets on the basis of factors including: the size of our consumer audience; the effectiveness of our advertising solutions; our pricing structure; and recognition of our brand.

Government Regulation
 As a company conducting business on the Internet, we are subject to a variety of laws in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including laws regarding privacy, data retention, distribution of user-generated content, consumer protection and data protection, among others. For example: 

● | Privacy. Because we receive, store and process personal information and other user data, including credit card information in certain cases, we are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws around the world regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other user data. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Liability for Third-Party Action. We rely on laws limiting the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties. 
● | Advertising. We are subject to a variety of laws, regulations and guidelines that regulate the way we distinguish paid search results and other types of advertising from unpaid search results. 
● | Information Security and Data Protection. The laws in many jurisdictions require companies to implement specific information security controls to protect certain types of information. Likewise, many jurisdictions have laws in place requiring companies to notify users if there is a security breach that compromises certain categories of their information. 

 Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that harm our business. The application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate. They may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, regulatory frameworks for privacy issues are currently in flux worldwide, and are likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. Similarly, laws providing immunity to websites that publish user-generated content are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted or the content provided by users. Changes in existing laws or regulations or their interpretations, as well as new legislation or regulations, could increase our administrative costs and make it more difficult for consumers to use our platform, resulting in less traffic and revenue. Such changes could also make it more difficult for us to provide effective advertising tools to businesses on our platform, resulting in fewer advertisers and less revenue. 
 As our business grows and evolves, we will also become subject to additional laws and regulations, including in jurisdictions outside of the United States. Foreign data protection, privacy and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the United States. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities. 
 Our Culture and Employees
 We take great pride in our company culture and consider it to be one of our competitive strengths. Our culture is at the foundation of our success, and it continues to help drive our business forward as a pivotal part of our everyday operations. It allows us to attract and retain a talented group of employees, create an energetic work environment and continue to innovate in a highly competitive market. As of December 31, 2016, we had 4,256 full-time employees globally. 
 Our culture extends beyond our offices and into the local communities in which people use Yelp. Our community management teams responsibilities include supporting the sharing of experiences by consumers in the local markets that they serve and increasing brand awareness. We organize events several times a year to recognize our most important contributors, facilitating face-to-face interactions, building the Yelp brand and fostering the sense of true community in which we believe so strongly. We also engage with small businesses. For example, we established the Yelp Small Business Advisory Council as a way to interact with and get feedback from our core community of local business owners. We also work with the U.S. Small Business Administration and other partners to educate small business owners across the United States on best practices for online marketing.

In addition, The Yelp Foundation, a non-profit organization established by our board of directors in November 2011, or the Foundation, directly supports consumers and local businesses in the communities in which we operate. In 2011, our board of directors approved the contribution and issuance to the Foundation of 520,000 shares of our common stock, of which the Foundation had sold 160,000 shares as of December 31, 2016. The Foundation uses the proceeds from the sale of its shares of our common stock to make grants to local non-profit organizations that are actively engaged in supporting community and small business growth. As of December 31, 2016, the Foundation held 360,000 shares of common stock, representing less than 1% of our outstanding capital stock. 
 Information About Segment and Geographic Revenue
 Information about segment and geographic revenue is set forth in Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
 Seasonality
 Our business is affected both by cyclicality in business activity and by seasonal fluctuations in Internet usage and advertising spending. We believe our rapid growth has masked most of the cyclicality and seasonality of our business. As our revenue growth rate slows, we expect that the cyclicality and seasonality in our business may become more pronounced, causing our operating results to fluctuate. In particular, based on historical trends, we expect traffic numbers to be weakest in the fourth quarter of the year in connection with end of the year holidays.
