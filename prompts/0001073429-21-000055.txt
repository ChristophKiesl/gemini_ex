 Item 1.  Business
Overview
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we refer to U.S. Concrete, Inc. and its subsidiaries as “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” or “U.S. Concrete,” unless we specifically state otherwise, or the context or content indicates otherwise. 
U.S. Concrete is a leading heavy building materials supplier of aggregates and ready-mixed concrete in select geographic markets in the United States, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Canada. The Company is focused on growing both organically and through strategic acquisitions in our target markets, particularly within our aggregate products segment. We are a leading supplier for large-scale commercial and industrial, residential and infrastructure (including streets, highways and other public works) construction projects in high-growth markets across the U.S. We hold leading vertically integrated (aggregates and ready-mixed concrete) market positions in New York City, New Jersey, Dallas-Fort Worth, West Texas, the San Francisco Bay Area and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
We operate principally in our East Region (which we define to include New York City, New Jersey, Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia), our Central Region (which we define as Texas, Oklahoma and the U.S. Virgin Islands), and our West Region (which we define to include California and British Columbia, Canada). Our percentage of total revenue by region for 2020 was:
Our total revenue for 2020 was $1.4 billion, of which we derived approximately 85.0% from our ready-mixed concrete segment, 11.1% from our aggregate products segment (excluding $64.2 million sold internally) and 3.9% from our other operations. For 2020, we had net income attributable to U.S. Concrete of $25.5 million. 
We serve substantially all segments of the construction industry in our select geographic markets. Our customers include contractors for commercial and industrial, residential and infrastructure sectors. Ready-mixed concrete product revenue percentage by type of construction activity for 2020 was approximately:
1


Our customers are generally involved in the construction industry, which is a cyclical business and is subject to general and more localized economic conditions. In addition, our business is impacted by seasonal variations in weather conditions, which vary by regional market. Accordingly, because of inclement weather, demand for our products and services during the winter months are typically lower than in other months of the year. Also, sustained periods of inclement weather and other adverse weather conditions could cause the delay of construction projects during other times of the year.
A more detailed discussion of our business, competitive strengths, business strategy and our industry can be found in Part I, Item 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, which is hereby incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The discussion that follows is intended to only update material changes to that discussion, as well as address the 2020 amendments to Regulation S-K that were designed to modernize reporting.

2020 Acquisitions 
On February 24, 2020, we acquired all of the equity of Coram Materials Corp. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “Coram Materials”), a sand and gravel producer in New York, for total fair value consideration of $142.9 million. This acquisition expanded our aggregate products operations in our East Region and increased the vertical integration of our New York City operations. Through this acquisition, we acquired an aggregates facility with 330 acres of land, including 180 mining acres containing approximately 41.9 million tons of in-place, proven and permitted aggregate reserves. In November 2020, we acquired certain assets of Sugar City Building Materials Co. that expanded our ready-mixed concrete operations in our West Region for total cash consideration of $7.6 million. The assets acquired primarily included inventory and property, plant and equipment. 
Our Products
Aggregate products
We produce crushed stone, sand and gravel from 20 aggregates facilities located in New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Texas, the U.S. Virgin Islands and British Columbia, Canada. We sell these aggregates for use in commercial, industrial and public works projects in the markets we serve, as well as consume them internally in the production of ready-mixed concrete. We produced approximately 13.7 million tons of aggregates during the year ended December 31, 2020, with British Columbia, Canada representing 39%, Texas and Oklahoma representing 32%, New Jersey and New York representing 27%, and the U.S. Virgin Islands representing 2% of the total production. While we consumed 34% of this production internally in 2020, we currently sell the majority of our aggregate products to third parties. We believe our aggregates reserves provide us with additional raw materials sourcing flexibility and supply availability.
Ready-mixed concrete 
Our standard ready-mixed concrete products consist of proportioned mixes we produce and deliver in an unhardened plastic state for placement and shaping into designed forms at the job site. Selecting the optimum mix for a job entails determining not only the ingredients that will produce the desired permeability, strength, appearance and other properties of the concrete after it has hardened and cured, but also the ingredients necessary to achieve a workable consistency considering the weather and other conditions at the job site. We believe we can achieve product differentiation for the mixes we offer because of the variety of mixes we can produce, our volume production capacity and our scheduling, delivery and placement reliability. Additionally, we believe our environmentally friendly technology initiative, which utilizes alternative materials and mix designs that result in lower CO2 emissions, helps differentiate us from our competitors. We also believe we distinguish ourselves with our value-added service approach that emphasizes reducing our customers’ overall construction costs by reducing the in-place cost of concrete and the time required for construction. 
Our volumetric concrete operations, one of the largest volumetric operations in the U.S., expand our ready-mixed concrete delivery and service offerings primarily in Texas. Volumetric ready-mixed concrete trucks mix concrete to the customer's specification on the job site, better serving smaller jobs and specialized applications, and allowing flexibility for servicing remote job locations. Because of their versatility, these trucks offer the contractor multiple options for a single job without the inconvenience or added costs typically associated with standard ready-mixed trucks delivering special or short-loads to a job site. Because of their unique on-demand production capabilities, these trucks minimize the amount of wasted concrete, which improves margins and reduces environmental impact. 
We also provide portable and mobile concrete plants for high-volume or remote projects. While currently operating predominantly in our existing regions, our fast-track mobilization business unit, U.S. Concrete On-Site, Inc., can dispatch a portable or mobile ready-mixed concrete plant anywhere in the continental U.S. These mobile solutions have reached an exceptional level of turnkey operations customized to deliver outstanding on-site solutions for all types of concrete construction. Not only are we providing industry leading concrete production operations to our customers, we are providing technical services and a substantial mitigation of risk with on-site production. 
Other
Other products include our building materials stores, hauling operations, aggregates distribution terminals, a recycled aggregates operation and concrete blocks. Two specific products included in this category are ARIDUS® Rapid Drying Concrete technology and the Where’s My Concrete?® family of web and mobile applications. 
ARIDUS Rapid Drying Concrete reduces the drying time and risks associated with excess moisture vapor in concrete slabs, enabling faster, more effective floor topping installations. ARIDUS was developed and patented by U.S. Concrete’s National Research Laboratory, USC Technologies, Inc., to address changes in environmental government regulations that limit or restrict volatile organic compounds in flooring adhesives. 
Where’s My Concrete? is our real-time cloud-based data delivery program that provides value-added service and transparency to our customers, while improving our business through critical analytics and operational efficiencies. 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 
We obtain most of the raw materials necessary to manufacture ready-mixed concrete on a daily basis. These materials include water, cement and other cementitious materials (such as fly ash and slag), aggregates (stone, gravel, and sand), and chemical admixtures. A standard cubic yard of concrete typically weighs 4,125 pounds and includes approximately 250 pounds of water, 550 pounds of cementitious material, 1,525 pounds of sand, and 1,800 pounds of stone. 
Cement is the binding agent used to bind water, crushed stone, and sand, in the production of ready-mixed concrete. Other industrial byproducts such as fly ash from coal burning power plants and slag from the manufacture of iron and silica fume have cementitious properties that allow it to be used as a substitute for cement, depending on specification. We purchase cementitious materials from a few suppliers in each of our major geographic markets. Aggregates are typically produced locally and are procured from a network of internal and external suppliers in each of our markets. In 2020, our ready-mixed concrete businesses purchased 42% of their aggregate products needs from internally operated quarries and sites. Chemical admixtures are generally purchased from suppliers under national purchasing agreements. 
With the exception of chemical admixtures, each plant typically maintains an inventory level of these materials sufficient to satisfy its operating needs for a few days. Inventory levels do not decline significantly or comparatively with declines in revenue during seasonally lower periods. We generally maintain inventory at specified levels to maximize purchasing efficiencies and to be able to respond quickly to customer demand. Generally, we negotiate with suppliers on a company-wide basis and at the local market level to obtain the most competitive pricing available. 
Competition
Because of the impact of transportation costs on the aggregates industry, our competition in the aggregates product segment tends to be limited to producers in proximity to each of our facilities. The industry is highly fragmented and includes smaller private aggregates producers in addition to large, national companies. All of our locations experience competition from local companies in addition to larger public companies. Competition is based on location, price, quality of aggregates and level of customer service. Our primary public company competitors are Cemex S.A.B. de C.V., CRH PLC, Colas SA, Heidelberg Cement AG, LafargeHolcim Ltd., Martin Marietta Materials, Inc., MDU Resources Group, Inc., Summit Materials, Inc. and Vulcan Materials Company. Companies in the industry tend to grow by acquiring existing facilities to enter new markets or expand their existing market positions.
The ready-mixed concrete industry is highly competitive. Our leadership position in a market depends largely on the location and operating costs of our plants and prevailing prices in that market. Price is the primary competitive factor among suppliers for small or less complex jobs, such as residential construction. However, the ability to meet demanding specifications for strength or sustainability, timeliness of delivery and consistency of quality and service, in addition to price, are the principal competitive factors among suppliers for large or complex jobs. Our competitors range from small, owner-operated private companies to subsidiaries of operating units of large, vertically integrated manufacturers of cement and aggregates. Our vertically integrated competitors generally have greater financial and marketing resources than we have, providing them with a competitive advantage. Competitors having lower operating costs than we do or having the financial resources to enable them to accept lower margins than we do will have a competitive advantage over us for jobs that are particularly price-sensitive. Competitors having greater financial resources or less financial leverage than we do may be able to invest more in new mixer trucks, ready-mixed concrete plants and other production equipment or pay for acquisitions, which could provide them a competitive advantage over us. 
Human Capital
Our strength is the character of our people. As of December 31, 2020, we had 631 salaried employees, including executive officers and management, sales, technical, administrative and clerical personnel and 2,336 hourly personnel. The number of employees fluctuates depending on the number and size of projects ongoing at any particular time, which may be impacted by variations in weather conditions throughout the year.
Business ethics
We endeavor to operate in accordance with high standards of fair, ethical and moral business conduct. A reputation of integrity is one of the most important assets of any individual or company and is key to achieving our core mission. Our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (“Code of Conduct”) ensures that our core value of integrity is applied throughout our operations. Our Code of Conduct also serves as a critical tool to assist with recognizing and reporting unethical conduct, while preserving and nurturing our culture of integrity. Our Code of Conduct is provided to all employees and remains accessible to all employees on the Company's internal website.
Human resources and hiring
We are committed to hiring, developing and supporting a diverse and inclusive workplace. We recruit the best people for the job regardless of gender, ethnicity or other protected traits, and it is our policy to fully comply with all applicable laws (domestic and foreign) regarding discrimination in the workplace. Our management teams and all of our employees are expected to exhibit and promote ethical and respectful conduct in the workplace. All of our employees must adhere to our Code of Conduct that sets standards for appropriate behavior. We believe the compensation we provide to our employees is competitive with others in our industry.
Labor relations
As of December 31, 2020, approximately 35% of our employees were represented by labor unions having collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced a strike or significant work stoppage in the past ten years. We interact with our labor unions in an atmosphere of mutual respect and seek to resolve disputes in an equitable manner. We believe our relationships with our employees and union representatives are very good. 
Safe working environment and training
The safety of our workforce is fundamental to the success of our business. The cornerstone of our risk management and safety program is safety awareness. We have established a “safety-first” culture through various programs and initiatives. We employ a national safety director whose responsibilities include managing and executing a unified, company-wide safety program. We require all field employees to attend periodic safety training meetings and all drivers to participate in training seminars. Employee safety is a factor used in evaluating performance in our annual incentive plan for certain salaried employees.
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters 
A wide range of federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations apply to our operations, including the following matters:
•water usage;
•land usage;
•street and highway usage;
•noise levels; 
•operating hours; and
•health, safety and environmental matters.
In many instances, we are required to have various certificates, permits, or licenses to conduct our business. Our failure to maintain these required authorizations or to comply with applicable laws or other governmental requirements could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct some of our operations. Delays in obtaining approvals for the transfer or grant of authorizations, or failures to obtain new authorizations, could impede acquisition efforts.
Environmental laws that impact our operations include those relating to air quality, solid waste management and water quality. These laws are complex and subject to frequent change. They impose strict liability in some cases without regard to negligence or fault. Sanctions for noncompliance may include revocation of permits, corrective action orders, administrative or civil penalties and criminal prosecution. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances. In addition, businesses may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances, as well as damage to natural resources. These laws also may expose us to liability for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, others or for acts that complied with all applicable laws when performed.
We have conducted Phase I environmental site assessments, which are non-intrusive investigations conducted to evaluate the potential for significant on-site environmental impacts, on substantially all the real properties we own or lease and have engaged independent environmental consulting firms to complete those assessments. We have not identified any environmental concerns associated with those properties that we believe are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, but we can provide no assurance material liabilities will not occur. In addition, our compliance with any amended, new or more stringent laws, stricter interpretations of existing laws, or the future discovery of environmental conditions could require additional, material expenditures.
We believe we have all material permits and licenses we need to conduct our operations and are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements relating to our operations. We have certain emissions credits that expand our sales capacity in California for aggregate products.
