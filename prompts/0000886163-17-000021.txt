Item 1. | Business

Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and acquiring technologies that help pharmaceutical companies discover and develop medicines. Over our more than 30 year history, we have employed research technologies such as nuclear receptor assays, high throughput computer screening, formulation science, liver targeted pro-drug technologies and antibody discovery technologies to assist companies in their work toward securing prescription drug approvals. We currently have partnerships and license agreements with over 95 pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and over 160 different programs under license with us are currently in various stages of commercialization and development. We have contributed novel research and technologies for approved medicines that treat cancer, osteoporosis, fungal infections and low blood platelets, among others. Our partners have programs currently in clinical development targeting seizure, coma, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, muscle wasting, liver disease, and kidney disease, among others. We have over 500 issued patents worldwide, and over 200 currently pending patent applications.
We have assembled our large portfolio of fully-funded programs either by licensing our own proprietary drug development programs, licensing our platform technologies such as Captisol or OmniAb to partners for use with their proprietary programs, or acquiring existing partnered programs from other companies. Fully-funded programs are those for which our partners pay all of the development and commercialization costs. For our internal programs, we generally plan to advance drug candidates through early-stage drug development or clinical proof-of-concept.
Our business model creates value for stockholders by providing a diversified portfolio of biotech and pharmaceutical product revenue streams that are supported by an efficient and low corporate cost structure. Our goal is to offer investors an opportunity to participate in the promise of the biotech industry in a profitable, diversified and lower-risk business than a typical biotech company. Our business model is based on doing what we do best: drug discovery, early-stage drug development, product reformulation and partnering. We partner with other pharmaceutical companies to leverage what they do best (late-stage development, regulatory management and commercialization) to ultimately generate our revenue. We believe that focusing on discovery and early-stage drug development while benefiting from our partners’ development and commercialization expertise will reduce our internal expenses and allow us to have a larger number of drug candidates progress to later stages of drug development.
Our revenue consists of three primary elements: royalties from commercialized products, license and milestone payments and sale of Captisol material. In addition to discovering and developing our own proprietary drugs, we selectively pursue acquisitions to bring in new assets, pipelines, and technologies to aid in generating additional potential new revenue streams.
2016 Major Business Highlights for Ligand
Acquisitions

• | Ligand acquired OMT in January 2016, conferring ownership of a large portfolio of licenses and the OmniAb platform, for $173.4 million in cash and stock.


• | Ligand acquired the economic rights to multiple medical device programs owned by CorMatrix in May 2016. Ligand paid $17.5 million and in return received a portion of revenue (synthetic royalty) from CorMatrix’s existing marketed products and will have the right to receive future synthetic royalties from potential future products. 

Late-Stage Clinical Data

• | On September 7, 2016, Retrophin announced results from the Phase 2 DUET study of sparsentan for the treatment of FSGS, a rare kidney disorder without an FDA-approved pharmacological treatment that often leads to end-stage renal disease. The study achieved statistical significance in the primary efficacy endpoint for the overall sparsentan treatment group, demonstrating a greater than two-fold reduction of proteinuria compared to irbesartan after the eight-week, double-blind treatment period. 


• | On December 6, 2016, Sage announced its expedited development plan for Sage-547 for treatment of postpartum depression, from a breakthrough therapy meeting with the FDA. The current Sage-547 program in PPD, along with prior Phase 2 data, were confirmed as supporting, if successful, a potential NDA. Sage’s PPD clinical program, now in Phase 3, will require only minor modifications, including an increase in sample size. 

2


• | Merck announced that it stopped the Phase 2/3 EPOCH study evaluating verubecestat in people with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease due to the conclusion that the efficacy endpoint could not be achieved. No safety concerns where noted. Results from EPOCH will be analyzed and presented at an upcoming scientific meeting. The external Data Monitoring Committee recommended that the ongoing Phase 3 APECS study, which is evaluating verubecestat in people with prodromal Alzheimer’s disease, continue unchanged. Results from the APECS study are expected in February 2019.

Ligand expects to report the results from the Phase 2 clinical trial in the third quarter of 2017.

Technologies
A variety of technology platforms that enable elements of drug discovery or development form the basis of our portfolio of fully-funded shots on goal. Platform technologies or individual drugs discovered by Ligand are related to a broad estate of intellectual property that includes over 500 issued patents and over 200 pending patent applications.
Captisol Technology
Captisol is Ligand’s patented, uniquely-modified cyclodextrin that is specifically designed to maximize safety, while improving the solubility, stability and bioavailability of APIs. Captisol can enable faster and more efficient development paths for our partners, given its known regulatory acceptance. Ligand maintains both Type IV and Type V DMFs with the FDA. These DMFs contain manufacturing and safety information relating to Captisol that our licensees can reference when developing Captisol-enabled drugs. Ligand also filed a DMF in Japan in 2015. Captisol-enabled drugs are marketed in more than 60 countries, and over 45 partners have Captisol-enabled drugs in development.
OmniAb Technologies
In January of 2016, Ligand acquired OMT and the OmniAb Technologies. OmniAb includes three complementary and globally-branded platforms named OmniRat, OmniMouse and OmniFlic. The OmniAb platforms consist of genetically-engineered transgenic rodents that produce a broadly diversified repertoire of antibodies and enable novel fully-human antibody drug discovery and development by our OmniAb partners. Fully-human OmniAb antibodies provide advantages to our partners in that fully-human antibodies have reduced immunogenicity, streamline development timelines and costs, and accelerate novel antibody discovery. Currently, more than 25 partners are utilizing OmniAb animals in their drug discovery and development efforts
LTP Technology Platform
The LTP Technology platform is a novel prodrug technology designed to selectively deliver a broad range of pharmaceutical agents to the liver. A prodrug is a biologically inactive compound that can be metabolized in the body to produce an active drug. The LTP Technology works by chemically modifying biologically active molecules into an inactive prodrug, which will be administered to a patient and later activated by specific enzymes in the liver. The technology can be used to improve the safety and/or activity of existing drugs, develop new agents to treat certain liver-related diseases, and treat diseases caused by imbalances of circulating molecules that are controlled by the liver. The technology is especially applicable to metabolic and cardiovascular indications, among others. Currently 3 partners are utilizing the LTP Technology or related platform(s).
SUREtechnology Platform (owned by Selexis)
Ligand acquired economic rights to over 30 SUREtechnology Platform programs from Selexis in two separate transactions in 2013 and 2015, granting Ligand rights to downstream economics on novel biologics and biosimilars programs. The SUREtechnology Platform, developed and owned by Selexis, is a novel technology that improves the way that cells are utilized in the development and manufacturing of recombinant proteins and drugs. The technology is based on novel DNA-based elements that control the dynamic organization of chromatin within mammalian cells and allow for higher and more stable expression of recombinant proteins. The technology creates advantages over traditional approaches including accelerated development and manufacturing times, high yields and increased compound stability.
CorMatrix products and technologies/programs (owned by CorMatrix)
4

Ligand acquired economic rights to multiple programs owned by CorMatrix in May 2016, granting Ligand rights to receive a portion of revenue (synthetic royalty) from CorMatrix’s existing marketed products and rights to future synthetic royalties from potential future products. Ligand receives a share of revenue from the currently marketed vascular, cardiac, and pericardial tissue repair products and the CanGaroo Envelope for cardiac implantable electronic devices. Additionally, Ligand has the rights to receive a share of potential future revenues from CorMatrix’s developmental pipeline products.

Selected Commercial Programs
We have multiple programs under license with other companies that have products that are already being commercialized. The following programs represent components of our current portfolio of revenue-generating assets and potential for near-term growth in royalty and other revenue. For information about the royalties owed to Ligand for these programs, see “Royalties” later in this business section.
Promacta (Novartis)
We are party to a license agreement with Novartis related to Promacta, which is an oral medicine that increases the number of platelets in the blood. Platelets are one of the three components of blood and facilitate clotting in the blood. Individuals with low platelets can be at significant risk of bleeding or death. Because of the importance of having a sufficient number of platelets, Promacta has broad potential applicability to a number of medical situations where low platelets exist.
Promacta is currently approved for three indications: (1) the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult and pediatric patients 1 year and older with ITP who have had an insufficient response to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins or splenectomy, (2) Hepatitis-C associated thrombocytopenia and (3) SAA. Promacta was initially approved in 2008, and the product has been generating royalty revenue for Ligand since 2009. Promacta is known as Revolade in the EU and other non-US markets.
Novartis has been and continues to pursue globalization of the brand and currently markets Promacta in multiple countries for the three approved indications. Specifically, ITP is currently approved in more than 100 countries, the Hepatitis C-related indication is currently approved in more than 50 countries, and the SAA indication is approved in more than 45 counties.
Beyond the currently-approved indications, Novartis is also performing development activities to expand the brand into new indications, including a number of oncology-related indications including MDS, AML and CIT. As of January 2017, there are 23 open clinical trials related to Promacta (listed as recruiting or open, and not yet recruiting) on the clinicaltrials.gov website.
We are entitled to receive royalties related to Promacta during the life of the relevant patents or following patent expiry, at a reduced rate for ten years from the first commercial sale, whichever is longer, on a country-by-country basis. Novartis has listed a patent in the FDA’s, Orange Book for Promacta with an expiration date in 2029, and absent early termination for bankruptcy or material breach, the term of the agreement expires upon expiration of the obligation to pay royalties. There are no remaining milestones to be paid under the agreement.
Kyprolis (Amgen)
Ligand supplies Captisol to Amgen for use with carfilzomib, and granted an exclusive product-specific license under our patent rights with respect to Captisol. Kyprolis is formulated with Ligand’s Captisol technology and is approved in the U.S. for the following:
8


• | In combination with dexamethasone or with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one to three lines of therapy.


• | As a single agent for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one or more lines of therapy.

Kyprolis is also approved in multiple countries and Amgen continues to invest significantly in Kyprolis to further expand its label and geography. Amgen’s obligation to pay royalties does not expire until four years after the expiration of the last-to-expire patent covering Captisol. Our patents and applications relating to the Captisol component of Kyprolis are not expected to expire until 2033. Our agreement with Amgen may be terminated by either party in the event of material breach or bankruptcy, or unilaterally by Amgen with prior written notice, subject to certain surviving obligations. Absent early termination, the agreement will terminate upon expiration of the obligation to pay royalties. Under this agreement, we are entitled to receive remaining milestones of up to $2 million, revenue from clinical and commercial Captisol material sales and royalties on annual net sales of Kyprolis.
Evomela (Spectrum)
Ligand supplies Captisol to Spectrum for use with Evomela, which is a Captisol-enabled melphalan IV formulation. The FDA approved Evomela for use in two indications:

• | A high-dose conditioning treatment prior to ASCT in patients with multiple myeloma


• | For the palliative treatment of patients with multiple myeloma for whom oral therapy is not appropriate

Evomela has been granted Orphan Designation by the FDA for use as a high-dose conditioning regimen for patients with multiple myeloma undergoing ASCT. The Evomela formulation avoids the use of propylene glycol, which has been reported to cause renal and cardiac side-effects that limit the ability to deliver higher quantities of therapeutic compounds. The use of the Captisol technology to reformulate melphalan is anticipated to allow for longer administration durations and slower infusion rates, potentially enabling clinicians to safely achieve a higher dose intensity of pre-transplant chemotherapy.
Under the terms of the license agreement, we granted an exclusive license to Spectrum under our patent rights to Captisol relating to the product. We are eligible to receive over $50 million in potential milestone payments under this agreement and royalties on future net sales of the Captisol-enabled melphalan product. Spectrum’s obligation to pay royalties will expire at the end of the life of the relevant patents or when a competing product is launched, whichever is earlier, but in no event within ten years of the commercial launch. Our patents and applications relating to the Captisol component of melphalan are not expected to expire until 2033. Absent early termination, the agreement will terminate upon expiration of the obligation to pay royalties. The agreement may be terminated by either party for an uncured material breach or unilaterally by Spectrum by prior written notice.
CorMatrix Portfolio (CorMatrix)
Ligand receives a share of revenue from the currently marketed CorMatrix portfolio of vascular, cardiac and pericardial tissue repair products. In addition, Ligand has the potential to receive a share of revenue and potential milestones from the currently marketed CorMatrix CanGaroo® ECM Envelope for cardiac implantable electronic devices. CorMatrix’s products are medical devices that are designed to permit the development and regrowth of human tissue.
Duavee or Duavive (bazedoxifene/conjugated estrogens) and Viviant/Conbriza (Pfizer)
Pfizer is marketing bazedoxifene under the brand names Viviant and Conbriza in various territories for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Pfizer is responsible for the registration and worldwide marketing of bazedoxifene, a synthetic drug specifically designed to reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures while also protecting uterine tissue. Pfizer has combined bazedoxifene with the active ingredient in Premarin to create a combination therapy for the treatment of post-menopausal symptoms in women. Pfizer is marketing the combination treatment under the brand names Duavee and Duavive in various territories. Net royalties on annual net sales of Viviant/Conbriza and Duavee/Duavive are each payable to us through the life of the relevant patents or ten years from the first commercial sale, whichever is longer, on a country by country basis.

Delafloxacin is a novel hospital-focused fluoroquinolone antibiotic candidate with potency against a variety of disease-causing bacteria-gram-positives, gram-negatives, atypicals and anaerobes, including quinolone-resistant MRSA. Under the terms of the agreement, we may be entitled to up to $2.1 million of development and regulatory milestones, as well as a royalty on potential future sales by Melinta, and revenue from Captisol material sales. Melinta is responsible for all development costs related to the program.
10

Brexanolone-SAGE-547 (SAGE)
 Our partner, SAGE, is conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial for the development of Captisol-enabled therapeutics for a broad range of debilitating central nervous system conditions. SAGE’s lead clinical program, Captisol-enabled Brexanolone (SAGE-547), is an allosteric modulator of both synaptic and extra-synaptic GABAA receptors that is in clinical development as an adjunctive therapy, a therapy combined with current therapeutic approaches, for the treatment of SRSE. Brexanolone was granted Fast Track designation, which is intended to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drug candidates that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs, and orphan drug designation, which is intended to facilitate drug development for rare diseases, by the FDA for SRSE. Ligand has the potential to receive milestone payments, royalties and revenue from Captisol material sales for Captisol-enabled programs. SAGE is responsible for all development costs related to the program.
SAGE is also conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial for the development of a Captisol-enabled treatment of PPD. In July 2016 SAGE reported top-line results from a Phase 2 placebo-controlled trial in women with severe PPD, in which SAGE-547 achieved a significant, rapid and durable reduction in depression scores. SAGE received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA for SAGE-547 in PPD in September, 2016. The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to offer a potentially expedited development path and review for promising drug candidates, which includes increased interaction and guidance from the FDA.
Sparsentan (Retrophin) 
Our partner, Retrophin, is developing sparsentan for orphan indications of severe kidney diseases, and has completed a Phase 2 clinical trial of sparsentan for the treatment of FSGS. Certain patient groups with severely compromised renal function, including those with FSGS, exhibit extreme proteinuria resulting in progression to dialysis and a high mortality rate. Sparsentan, with its unique dual blockade of angiotensin and endothelin receptors, is expected to provide meaningful clinical benefits in mitigating proteinuria in indications where there are no approved therapies. In January 2015, the FDA granted sparsentan orphan drug designation.
Under our license agreement with Retrophin we are entitled to receive potential net milestones of over $75 million in the future and net royalties on future worldwide sales by Retrophin. The royalty term is expected to be 10 years following the first commercial sale. Retrophin is responsible for all development costs related to the program.

Verubecestat-MK-8931 (Merck)
Our partner, Merck is developing Verubecestat (MK-8931), a BACE inhibitor for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Alzheimer’s disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disease and responsible for the majority of dementia cases. The leading hypothesis in the field postulates that plaques of amyloid-beta protein within the brain are the main cause of the disease. BACE is a key enzyme in the production of amyloid-beta protein and a BACE inhibitor is expected to reduce amyloid-beta protein generation in Alzheimer’s disease patients to prevent plaques formation. Verubecestat is the leading BACE inhibitor in clinic. In February 2017, Merck halted the first Phase 3 trial in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease for futility and expects initial data readout from the second Phase 3 trial in prodromal Alzheimer’s disease in 2019.  It is hoped that by attacking amyloid-beta plaque earlier in the disease, Verubecestat can still be effective. We are entitled to a royalty on potential future sales by Merck.

Primary Internal Development Program - Glucagon Receptor Antagonist Program
We are currently developing a small molecule glucagon receptor antagonist for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Compounds that block the action of glucagon may reduce the hyperglycemia that is characteristic of the disease. Glucagon stimulates the production of glucose by the liver and its release into the blood stream. In diabetic patients, glucagon secretion is abnormally elevated and contributes to hyperglycemia in these patients. We announced results in 2016 from two Phase I clinical trials which demonstrated favorable safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics in normal healthy volunteers and in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The trial results also demonstrate a robust, dose-dependent reduction of fasting plasma glucose. We also initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial in September 2016 for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of LGD-6972, as an adjunct to diet and exercise, in subjects with T2DM whose blood glucose levels are inadequately controlled with metformin.

Manufacturing
We currently have no manufacturing facilities and rely on a third party, Hovione, for Captisol production. Hovione is a global supplier with over 50 years of experience in the development and manufacture of APIs and Drug Product Intermediates. Hovione operates FDA-inspected sites in the United States, Macau, Ireland and Portugal. Manufacturing operations for Captisol are currently performed in both of Hovione's Portugal and Ireland sites with distribution operations also performed from Hovione's Portugal and Ireland sites.
We have ongoing minimum purchase commitments under the agreement and are required to pay Hovione an aggregate minimum amount during the agreement term.
In the event of a Captisol supply interruption, we are permitted to designate and, with Hovione’s assistance, qualify one or more alternate suppliers. If the supply interruption continues beyond a designated period, we may terminate the agreement. In addition, if Hovione cannot supply our requirements of Captisol due to an uncured force majeure event or if the unit price of Captisol exceeds a set figure, we may obtain Captisol from a third party.
The current term of the agreement with Hovione is through December 2019. The agreement will automatically renew for successive two year renewal terms unless either party gives written notice of its intention to terminate the agreement no less than two years prior to the expiration of the initial term or renewal term. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement for the uncured material breach or bankruptcy of the other party or an extended force majeure event. We may terminate the agreement for extended supply interruption, regulatory action related to Captisol or other specified events. For further discussion of these items, see below under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Competition
Some of the drugs we and our licensees are developing may compete with existing therapies or other drugs in development by other companies. Furthermore, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competing products or technologies and may establish collaborative arrangements with our competitors.
Existing or potential competitors to our licensee’s products, particularly large pharmaceutical companies, may have greater financial, technical and human resources than our licensees. Accordingly, these competitors may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market products. Many of these companies also have extensive experience in preclinical testing and human clinical trials, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products.
Our Captisol business may face competition from other suppliers of similar cyclodextrin excipients or other technologies that are aimed to increase solubility or stability of APIs. Our OmniAb antibody technology faces competition from suppliers of other transgenic animal systems that are also available for antibody drug discovery.
15

Our competitive position also depends upon our ability to obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes. For a discussion of the risks associated with competition, see below under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Government Regulation
The research and development, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries.  We and our partners, depending on specific activities performed, are subject to these regulations. In the United States, pharmaceuticals are subject to regulation by both federal and various state authorities, including the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act govern the testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products and there are often comparable regulations that apply at the state level.  There are similar regulations in other countries as well. For both currently marketed and products in development, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can, among other things, result in delays, the suspension of regulatory approvals, as well as possible civil and criminal sanctions. In addition, changes in existing regulations could have a material adverse effect on us or our partners. For a discussion of the risks associated with government regulations, see below under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Patents and Proprietary Rights
We believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to our inventions that are considered important to the development of our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position.
Patents are issued or pending for the following key products or product families. The scope and type of patent protection provided by each patent family is defined by the claims in the various patents. The nominal patent expiration dates have been provided. The actual patent term may vary by jurisdiction and depend on a number of factors including potential patent term adjustments, patent term extensions, and terminal disclaimers. For each product or product family, the patents and/or applications referred to are in force in at least the United States, and for most products and product families, the patents and/or applications are also in force in European jurisdictions, Japan and other jurisdictions.
