ITEM 1. Business
Overview
 
CarLotz is a leading consignment-to-retail used vehicle marketplace that provides our corporate vehicle sourcing partners and retail sellers of used vehicles with the ability to easily access the retail sales channel while simultaneously providing buyers with prices that are, on average, below those of traditional dealerships. Our mission is to create the world’s greatest vehicle buying and selling experience. We operate a technology-enabled buying, sourcing and selling model that offers a seamless omni-channel experience and comprehensive selection of vehicles. Our proprietary technology provides our corporate vehicle sourcing partners with real-time performance metrics and data analytics along with custom business intelligence reporting that enables price and vehicle triage optimization between the wholesale and retail channels. Through our marketplace model, we generate significant value for both sellers and buyers through price, selection and experience.
Our Corporate Vehicle Sourcing Partners, Retail Sellers and Customers
 
We offer our products and services to (i) corporate vehicle sourcing partners, (ii) retail sellers of used vehicles and (iii) retail customers seeking to buy used vehicles.
Corporate Vehicle Sourcing Partners
 
Our corporate vehicle sourcing partners include fleet leasing companies, rental car companies, banks, captive finance companies, third-party remarketers, wholesalers, companies that manage their own fleets and original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs. We offer our corporate vehicle sourcing partners a pioneering, Retail Remarketing™ service that fully integrates with their existing technology platforms. For a per vehicle fee that is either flat, based on a return above a wholesale index or based on a profit share program depending on the partner, we provide our partners with access to the higher value retail market and our suite of custom-built data analytics. For corporate vehicle sourcing partners, our advanced vehicle triage data includes price optimization, custom-built intelligence reporting and asset management, providing them with data driven answers regarding vehicle pricing, condition and maintenance. This fully integrated system gives us improved visibility over our vehicle sourcing supply, vehicle type and the geographic location of our corporate vehicle sourcing partners’ fleets.
Retail Sellers
 
For individuals who are our retail sellers, we offer a hassle-free selling experience while allowing them to generate on average up to $1,000 or more for their vehicle, net of all fees and expenses, than when utilizing the alternative wholesale sales channel (i.e., auction, trade-in, etc.) and stay fully informed by tracking the sale process through our easy to navigate online portal. While individual sellers have always had the option of trading in their vehicle or selling it in the peer-to-peer marketplace, we give them access to a true, omni-channel retail marketplace with nationwide coverage. For a flat fee, our experienced CarLotz teammates will advertise, merchandise and ultimately sell their vehicle through our national marketplace. On average, the entire process is completed within 30 to 60 days and our retail sellers completely avoid time-consuming interactions and negotiations with potential buyers.
Retail Customers
 
We offer our retail customers a hassle-free vehicle buying experience at prices generally lower than our competitors. Buyers can browse our extensive, and growing, inventory online through our website or at our locations as well as select from our fully integrated finance and insurance products with relative ease. We put our buyers in control of the sale, allowing them to choose, at any point in the process, if they want to interact in-person or use our full suite of fully on-line, touchless, paperless and hassle-free e-commerce tools. This fully omni-channel sales model means that once a potential customer begins the vehicle selection process, they can seamlessly move between our in-person and online options at every step of the transaction. For example, a customer could select their vehicle and financing options online, visit one of our hubs to meet our friendly sales coaches and test drive the car, with the transaction being finalized from their home with a scheduled delivery of their car. Unlike traditional dealerships, we use non-commissioned sales coaches to help buyers with vehicle selection. Once a vehicle is selected, either online or in-person, a buyer can navigate through the entire buying process. The end result is that we reduce our overhead and inventory costs, while cost savings are passed on to our buyers. This process allows our buyers to pay, on average, significantly below traditional dealership prices.

CarLotz: A true marketplace business
 
Our Marketplace
 
We believe our marketplace model drives higher returns relative to our competition. Through the industry’s leading consignment-to-retail sales model, CarLotz is able to obtain non-competitively sourced inventory to sell. Following an initial ramp-up period following the opening of our hubs, consigned vehicles generally represent on average approximately 75% of our vehicle inventory, with approximately 60% or more of our total vehicle inventory originating from our growing relationships with corporate vehicle sourcing partners. During initial ramp-up, we have a higher portion of purchased vehicles to ensure a well-stocked inventory.
Our Retail Hubs
 
Founded in 2011, CarLotz currently operates ten retail hub locations, with two additional facilities under lease. Initially launched in the Mid-Atlantic region, CarLotz has since expanded to the Southeast, Southcentral, Midwest and Pacific Northwest regions of the United States. Our current facilities are located in the following cities:

· | Midlothian, VA (opened in 2011)
--+--------------------------------


· | Richmond, VA (2012)
--+--------------------


· | Chesapeake, VA (2012)
--+----------------------


· | Greensboro, NC (2016)
--+----------------------


· | Charlotte, NC (2016)
--+---------------------


· | Tampa, FL (2018)
--+-----------------


· | Chicago, IL (2018)
--+-------------------


· | San Antonio, TX (2018)
--+-----------------------


· | Seattle, WA (2021)
--+-------------------


· | Merritt Island, FL (2021)
--+--------------------------

 
We also signed new leases for hubs in Nashville, TN and Charlottesville, VA in the first quarter of 2021.
 
Our hubs act as both physical showrooms with predictable retail sales volumes and as consignment centers where we can source, process and recondition newly acquired inventory. Our ability to source inventory through these locations is important to our asset-light business model. At these hubs, our vehicles undergo an extensive 133-point inspection and reconditioning in preparation for resale. Our hubs are more than just locations to buy, sell and repair vehicles in preparation for resale but are also crucial to the information and data-analytics that we make available to our corporate vehicle sourcing partners and retail customers. With experience from our initial locations, we have learned how to scale our hub and processing operations to drive efficiencies. As we continue to grow our physical and online footprint, these hubs and the vast amount of information they provide will continue to be an important source of value to our buyers, sellers and our business model.
 
Our Technology
 
For our corporate vehicle sourcing partners, we have developed proprietary technology that integrates with their internal systems and supports every step in the consignment, reconditioning and sales process. For our retail buyers, we have developed a fully digital, end-to-end e-commerce platform that includes every step in the vehicle selection, financing and check-out process. To supplement these systems, we have developed custom-built data analytics tools that provide real time information to our corporate vehicle sourcing partners, retail sellers, retail buyers and ourselves. Using this technology, we are able to lower the days-to-sale while assisting sellers to receive higher vehicle values and track every step of the sales process. For our retail buyers, we offer a fully digital and hassle-free process that offers our full range of services, from vehicle selection to at home, touchless delivery, as we continue to expand our technological solutions. Our strategy is to roll out a fully integrated mobile application while continuing to expand our digital car buying platform.

Our Industry and Market Opportunity
 
The U.S. used vehicle market is very large and fragmented and ripe for disruption due to its high degree of customer dissatisfaction, limited e-commerce penetration and changing consumer buying patterns.
The U.S. Used Vehicle Market is Massive, Fragmented and Supports Multiple Winners. The U.S. used vehicle market is the largest consumer product category in the United States, generating approximately $841 billion in sales from approximately 42 million units in 2019, according to Edmunds Used Vehicle Report 2019. There are approximately 50,000 automotive dealers; however, the largest U.S. used vehicle dealer had less than 2% market share in 2019. For comparison, CarLotz currently represents 0.02% of U.S. used car sales by volume.
 
Traditional used vehicle dealerships are ripe for service-focused disruptors. The traditional used vehicle buying process suffers from poor customer experience as evidenced by the low NPS score of traditional automotive retailers (auto retailers averaging an NPS score of 7) as well as the lack of transparency, safety and logistics considerations inherent to the peer-to-peer market. Existing traditional used vehicle dealerships are notorious for high-pressure sales tactics, limited inventory selection and lack of transparent pricing. The peer-to-peer market is unlike a traditional retailer due to its lack of financing or warranty options, lack of verified vehicle condition and lack of secure payment methods. With these considerations in mind, consumers are inherently drawn to new entrants in the space that are focused on the customer experience.
 
Limited yet rapidly increasing e-commerce penetration in the U.S. The used automotive market has one of the lowest e-commerce penetration levels relating to a consumer product, representing less than 1% share of all used automotive sales in 2019. Yet at the same time, 97% of customer automotive purchases involve online research and 82% of the population uses an online third-party website for car shopping, displaying the growing reliability on online sources.
 
Increasing reliance on personal vehicles and car ownership. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, both economically-conscious consumers and those focused on health and safety by avoiding public transportation and ride-sharing services have pivoted towards personal vehicles and car ownership. Although the ultimate impact of COVID-19 remains uncertain, recent surveys found that 55% of those surveyed are actively considering buying a car and 67% reported an increased reliance on personal vehicles. Furthermore, 60% of those surveyed were open to buying a car online as compared to 32% prior to the pandemic. Although we can provide no assurance that we will not see further negative impacts from the pandemic and related economic recession, we feel confident that these changing consumer preferences are permanent and will result in positive medium and long-term trends for our business.
 
Heightened demand for used cars, coupled with a low interest rate environment and shortages in new vehicle inventory, are increasing used vehicle pricing. Manufacturing shutdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as increasing reliance on personal vehicles have contributed to shortages of new vehicle inventory, resulting in increased demand and pricing for used vehicles. As near-term new vehicle supply shortages subside, we continue to believe that lower long-term interest rates and consumer focus on incremental savings from purchasing used cars compared to new vehicles will continue to support strong demand and pricing for the used automotive industry.
 
Growing mix of pick-ups and SUVs where CarLotz has an inventory advantage. Our focus is on the largest and most profitable market segments in the industry where we retain an outsized inventory mix in these categories compared to our e-commerce peers. We closely match the industry vehicle mix among cars, SUVs, pick-up trucks and vans, with a slight bias towards pick-up trucks and vans, which represent the most profitable and fastest growing segments. Of all new vehicle sales, 70% are pick-up trucks and SUVs, which will enter the used vehicle market increasingly over time. Our peers focus less on these vehicles given their higher average reconditioning costs compared to sedans.

Our Key Strengths
 
We believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from these industry dynamics due to the following key strengths:
 
Pioneering vehicle sourcing, buying and selling platform
 
We have pioneered a scalable end-to-end e-commerce platform for buying, sourcing and selling vehicles that allows both our corporate vehicle sourcing partners and retail sellers to capture more value for their vehicles by accessing the retail sales channel.
 
Proprietary technological solutions
 
Our technology platform offers customizable business intelligence reporting and data-analytics that integrate directly with our corporate vehicle sourcing partners’ internal systems. This provides our partners with real-time performance metrics, which helps with price optimization and vehicle fleet management. At the same time, we can optimize our vehicle sourcing by tracking inventory.
 
Fully omni-channel buying experience
 
We empower our customers to control their vehicle buying process by allowing them to seamlessly move between our in-person and online buying options at each step of the transaction, from vehicle selection, to financing, to closing the deal.
 
Superior unit economics and capital efficiency
 
Our asset-light inventory sourcing model allows us to source 90% of our vehicles through non-competitive channels, which leads to limited capital risk and best-in-class unit economics with multiples that represent a meaningful discount to key peers. Our model has generally allowed us to have lower customer acquisition costs and investment in at-risk inventory while at the same time boasting higher contribution margin per unit than most of our competitors.
 
Focus on the most profitable segment of the used vehicle market
 
We focus on the largest and most profitable segments of the used car market. Generally, used cars that are six to 10 years old account for over half of all sales, followed by cars in the three- to five-year range, which account for an additional quarter of all sales. Over 75% of our sales are cars aged four or more years, which is considerably higher than the age of cars offered by our primary competitors. We closely match the industry vehicle mix among cars, SUVs, pick-up trucks and vans, with a slight bias towards pick-up trucks and vans, which represent the most profitable and fastest growing segments. We expect to continue seeing retail sales price increases, which are driven by our favorable used car mix and robust used car market dynamics.
 
Solid foundation with tremendous growth opportunity from additional investment
 
Our ten existing hubs (with two additional facilities under lease) serve as our sales, sourcing and processing centers. These hubs are a model for our national expansion efforts. With additional investment in new hubs, our strategy is to expand our inventory sourcing and reconditioning, further penetrate our existing accounts and leverage our national footprint to access new corporate vehicle sourcing accounts and the public generally, while improving our market share in consigned vehicles.
 
Visionary leadership team and strong corporate culture
 
We are led by a visionary founder who is passionate about the Company and a highly capable management team with deep automotive, sales and financial experience. The CarLotz culture is built on the pillars of (i) customer service — providing a world-class guest experience, (ii) integrity — delivering on promises and treating everyone with respect, (iii) transparency — believing that buyers and sellers should see the whole chessboard and both walk away winners and (iv) fun — passion to have fun with the team and guests. These cultural pillars are the foundation of our success.

Our Strategy
 
We have an interconnected and executable growth strategy centered on (i) geographic expansion, (ii) further penetration of existing accounts and key vehicle channels, (iii) innovation and expansion of technological leadership, (iv) investments in additional reconditioning capacity, (v) addition of new corporate vehicle sourcing accounts, (vi) investment in brand and tactical marketing and (vii) increased service offerings and price optimization.
 
With a solid, profitable foundation, additional capital investments will enable us to accelerate our expansion into identified new locations and our investments in new technology. At the core of our growth strategy is our plan to develop a nationwide hub footprint during the next five years. CarLotz has grown from a single hub founded in 2011 to ten hubs today (with two additional facilities under lease), extending geographically from the Mid-Atlantic to the Southeast, Southcentral, Midwest and Pacific Northwest regions of the continental United States with three hubs in those markets added in 2018 and four hubs added in 2021. As part of our expansion efforts, our strategy is to invest in an improved logistics and distribution network, vehicle sourcing and marketing and consumer vehicle purchase marketing.
 
Expansion Into New Geographic Markets
 
We actively monitor attractive markets to evaluate whether it is a desirable market to invest in, and if so, our real estate team will scout for an available hub location. In identifying a specific hub location, we focus on highly concentrated or growing demographic areas and attractive start-up costs. Our hubs typically service a geographic area of around 300 miles, while some of our commercial accounts expand our coverage up to 1,000 miles, based on available inventory type.
 
The opening of new hub locations in Tampa and Chicago in 2018 highlight our ability to cost-effectively enter new markets and quickly achieve profitability. In Tampa, start-up costs prior to our first sale were less than $100,000, the location had its first sale four months after lease signing and the facility became profitable within 20 months. In Chicago, start-up costs prior to our first sale were approximately $150,000, the location had its first sale three months after lease signing and was profitable within 12 months.
 
Our real estate team has identified our first set of new hub locations, including our newly opened Seattle and Merritt Island locations and our newly leased Nashville and Charlottesville locations, in furtherance of our strategy of opening more than 10 new hubs in 2021 and more than 40 hubs by the end of 2023. We actively continue to monitor new markets and look to identify locations where we can establish quickly, typically within three to five months from the time we sign a lease to our first sale, and initial investment of approximately $750,000 or less. We focus on urban areas with high visibility locations around established automotive dealerships where we believe our model can scale quickly. Once a hub location has been selected, we look to recruit six to eight people to operate the new location along with a team from established locations to ensure a successful launch. As part of our current expansion, we are focused on locations that are more geographically distant from our current hubs, which will allow us to better serve our national corporate vehicle sourcing partners and add new accounts in locations where we do not yet have a physical presence.
 
We believe an expanded footprint will enable us to increase our vehicle sales and further penetrate our national corporate vehicle sourcing partners while also attracting new corporate vehicle sourcing accounts that were previously unavailable due to our geographic limitations. We currently expect to invest $21 million over the next two years as we expand to a true national model. As we increase the number of retail hubs, we expect to raise service levels, enabling increased per vehicle economics.
 
Further Penetration of Existing Accounts and Key Vehicle Channels
 
We believe that we can benefit from significant untapped opportunities with existing corporate vehicle sourcing partners and that our growing footprint will allow us to better serve our national accounts. Many of our existing partners still sell less than 5% of their vehicles through the retail channel as they typically are (i) still integrating retail remarketing into their programs, (ii) gaining further comfort with the expanding vehicle types, quality and condition available in the retail market and (iii) waiting for our hubs to be opened in key markets where their vehicles are turned in. We have a significant opportunity to further strengthen our relationships with these existing corporate vehicle sourcing partners. As retail remarketing continues to develop as a more established alternative and as CarLotz expands to service buyers and sellers nationwide, we anticipate substantial growth with our existing commercial sellers.

Innovation and Expanded Technological Leadership
 
We are constantly reviewing our technology platform in furtherance of our strategy to leverage our existing technological leadership through our end-to-end e-commerce platform designed to continually enhance both the car buying and selling experience, while providing insightful data analytics in real time. We expect our integrated mobile application to provide a seamless shopping experience while allowing CarLotz to source more vehicles from corporate vehicle sourcing partners and retail sellers. The scalable nature of this mobile, fully integrated, sourcing partner and customer experience will allow us to further leverage our expanding hub network and establish a larger footprint as we continue to grow our business. Our multi-platform compatible user interface enables anyone, anywhere to access our suite of products and become a vehicle consignor or satisfied customer. Over the next two years, we plan to further invest significantly in our core suite of technology to enhance the buyer and seller experience, improve our B2B vehicle sourcing and expand our business intelligence capabilities with increased machine learning and artificial intelligence. In addition, we plan to invest significant amounts for various retail and processing enhancements, the commercialization of our proprietary technology solutions for our corporate vehicle sourcing partners, and the creation of industry technology standards for retail remarketing communication and marketplace analytics.
Investments in Hubs and Technology Enhance Our Processing Capacity and Efficiency
 
Our hubs with integrated vehicle processing centers allow us to add value by efficiently reconditioning vehicles and quickly moving them to market. Our hubs with integrated vehicle processing centers support the reconditioning fees charged to our corporate vehicle sourcing partners and retail sellers in preparation of the vehicle for sale. Improving efficiencies in our vehicle processing, especially in our technology platforms capable of interfacing directly with our corporate vehicle sourcing partners, enhances our reputation and brand and improves volume and revenue generation. All of the cars we sell undergo a rigorous 133-point inspection, which ensures that the cars we sell meet our safety, reliability and physical appearance standards. Our reconditioning program is driven by years of experience and allows us to cost-effectively repair, enhance and process a large number of vehicles. These integrated processing centers are much more than simply vehicle repair and reconditioning service centers, they are crucial to the information and data-analytics that have made our model successful. Many of our sellers are also corporate vehicle sourcing partners and the information we gather during processing, such as mechanical failures, brake pad condition and cosmetic damage, allows them to better manage their current and future vehicle fleets and make more informed selling decisions.
 
As we scale our business, our plan is to invest in increased processing capacity. In addition to achieving cost savings and operational efficiencies, we aim to lower our days to sale. Going forward, we plan to make capital investments in additional hubs with integrated vehicle processing centers by leveraging our data analytics and deep industry experience and taking into account a combination of factors, including proximity to buyers and sellers, transportation costs, access to inbound inventory and sustainable low-cost labor. All of these initiatives are designed to lower reconditioning costs per unit and thereby improve per unit economics.
 
Addition of New Corporate Vehicle Sourcing Accounts
 
We plan to leverage our national footprint in order to access new corporate vehicle sourcing partners, which may not have been accessible to the Company in the past due to geographic limitations. We believe there is substantial opportunity for consignments from corporate vehicle sourcing partners given the size of the total remarketing volume. Our potential vehicle sources include large corporate accounts that do not currently use our services. Additional vehicle volume from new accounts would allow us to improve our consigned vehicle market share at new and existing locations.
Investment in Brand and Tactical Marketing
 
To date, we have built our brand with a relatively limited marketing budget of less than $4 million annually, targeting local audiences with radio, digital and out-of-home advertising, such as billboards. With the additional capital we raised from the Merger, we intend to ramp up our local advertising and begin to focus on a more national audience. Our plan includes analytics-driven, targeted marketing investments to accelerate growth while being accretive to margins, involving a budget of approximately $15 million for marketing that will focus on local advertising efforts and a nationwide campaign to expand our market reach and enhance our brand. We will also invest in a professional team that will be dedicated to developing and implementing our marketing strategy. With improved awareness of our brand and our services, we plan to identify, attract and convert new sourcing partners at optimized cost.
 
 10


Increased Service Offerings and Price Optimization
 
As we further develop the CarLotz brand, we believe our enhanced platform will support increased fees and optimized vehicle pricing. We plan to enhance our service offerings to not only generate additional profit per vehicle but also to better serve our sellers and buyers. We believe that additional investment in targeted areas will support increased fees, gross profit per vehicle and overall lift by improving our days-to-sale and vehicle pricing. Areas of potential further investment in service offerings include (i) expansion of existing and new F&I products to cover appearance, roadside assistance, key insurance and wheel and tire protection, (ii) expansion of our digital wholesale remarketing alternatives for corporate vehicle sourcing partners by building an in-house wholesale vehicle market for those vehicles that we do not sell through our retail channel, and (iii) further development of a front-end digital solution to source more vehicles from consumers.
Marketing
 
Our current marketing plan revolves around targeted advertising in the geographic locations where we already have established hubs. When we enter a new market, we develop a locally-focused advertising plan to build our brand recognition and awareness. We focus on digital marketing, which we optimize for search engine results, as well as radio and out-of-home advertising. As we gain a foothold in new markets, we also rely on word of mouth praise and referrals from satisfied customers to further drive additional growth. Over time, these strategies allow us to identify, attract and convert new sourcing partners at a lower cost than many of our competitors. As part of our national expansion strategy, we hired an experienced chief marketing officer and plan to significantly expand our marketing budget and engage in more sophisticated forms of marketing.
Technology
 
We have developed proprietary technology with an end-to-end e-commerce platform that improves the experience for both sellers and buyers. Our B2B portal and integration framework support the assignment, re-conditioning, sale and remittance of vehicles from our corporate vehicle sourcing partners. In addition, our custom-built automotive ERP integrates all technology with business analytics, AI and machine learning, workflow management, user and data security and content delivery platforms. This allows us to expand our competitive moat through higher returns, lower days-to-sell and deep technology integration for corporate vehicle sourcing partners.
 
Our proprietary application includes a suite of features tailored to create significant value for both buyers and sellers with tools for photographing, documenting and transmitting vehicle information. This includes a proprietary custom-built vehicle retailing and wholesaling platform that creates and verifies all documents for the purchase, sale and financing over the web or in-hub. This combines our proprietary algorithms with artificial intelligence to select, price and determine the best retail location for all vehicles. Our technology offers a custom system for managing customer leads, scheduling appointments and test drives from our applications and websites as well as from third party providers.
 
Seasonality
 
Used vehicle sales experience seasonality with sales typically peaking late in the first calendar quarter of each year and diminishing through the rest of the year, with the lowest relative level of vehicle sales expected to occur in the fourth calendar quarter. Due to our rapid growth, our overall sales patterns to date have not reflected the general seasonality of the used vehicle industry, but we expect this to change once our business and markets mature. Used vehicle prices also exhibit seasonality, with used vehicle prices depreciating at a faster rate in the last two quarters of each year and a slower rate in the first two quarters of each year. Historically, this has led our gross profit per unit to be higher on average in the first half of each year than in the second half of the year. It is not clear at this time whether seasonal trends will be affected by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
 11


Intellectual Property
 
The protection of our technology and other intellectual property is an important aspect of our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property (including our technology and confidential information) through a combination of trademark, trade secret and copyright law, as well as contractual commitments and security procedures. We generally require certain of our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements and certain third parties to enter into nondisclosure agreements. We regularly review our technology development efforts and branding strategy to identify and assess the protection of new intellectual property. We own certain trademarks important to our business, such as the CarLotz trademark.
 
We currently hold rights to the “CarLotz.com” Internet domain name and various other related domain names. The regulation of domain names in the United States is subject to change. Regulatory bodies could establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may not be able to acquire or maintain all domain names that use the name CarLotz or are otherwise relevant to or descriptive of our business.
 
While software can be protected under copyright law, we have chosen to rely primarily on trade secret law in order to protect our proprietary software and have chosen not to register any copyrights in these works. In the United States, copyright must be registered in order to enforce certain rights. Therefore, the remedies and damages available to us for unauthorized use of our software may be limited.
 
Intellectual property laws, contractual commitments and security procedures provide only limited protection, and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. Further, trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary materials may be independently developed by our competitors or revealed to the public or our competitors and no longer provide protection for the related intellectual property. In addition, intellectual property laws vary from country to country, and we have not sought trademark registrations outside of the United States. We may therefore be unable to protect certain of our proprietary technology, brands or other intellectual property in other jurisdictions.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our business is and will continue to be subject to U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations. The advertising, sale, purchase, financing and transportation of used vehicles is regulated by every state in which we operate and by the U.S. federal government. We also are subject to state laws related to titling and registration and wholesale vehicle sales, and our sale of value-added products is subject to state licensing requirements, as well as federal and state consumer protection laws. These laws can vary from state to state. The applicability of these regulatory and legal compliance obligations to our e-commerce business depends on evolving interpretations of these laws and regulations and how our operations are, or are not, subject to them, and we may face regulatory action if regulators believe that we are not in compliance with such obligations.
 
In addition, we are subject to regulations and laws specifically governing the internet and e-commerce and regulations and laws governing the collection, storage and use of personal information and other customer data. We are also subject to federal and state consumer protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunities Act and prohibitions against unfair or deceptive acts or practices. The federal governmental agencies that regulate our business and have the authority to enforce such regulations and laws against us include the FTC, the Department of Transportation, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration, the Department of Justice, the Federal Communications Commission and the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. For example, the FTC has jurisdiction to investigate and enforce our compliance with certain consumer protection laws and has brought enforcement actions against auto dealers relating to a broad range of practices, including the sale and financing of value-added or add-on products and the collection, storage and use of consumer personal information. Additionally, we are subject to regulation by individual state dealer licensing authorities, state consumer protection agencies and state financial regulatory agencies. We also are subject to audit by such state regulatory authorities.
 
State dealer licensing authorities regulate the purchase and sale of used vehicles and add-on products, including financing, by dealers within their respective states. We are licensed as a dealer in Virginia, North Carolina, Florida, Illinois, Texas and Washington and all of our transactions are conducted under our respective state licenses.
 
 12


Some states regulate retail installment sales, including setting a maximum interest rate, caps on certain fees or maximum amounts financed. In addition, certain states require that retail installment sellers file a notice of intent or have a sales finance license or an installment sellers license in order to solicit or originate installment sales in that state. All vehicle sale transactions and applicable retail installment financings are conducted under our dealer licenses. As we seek to expand our operations and presence into other states, we may be required to obtain additional finance or other licenses, and we may not be able to obtain such licenses within the timeframe we expect or at all.
 
In addition to these laws and regulations that apply specifically to the sale and financing of used vehicles, our facilities and business operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, occupational health and safety and other broadly applicable business regulations. We also are subject to laws and regulations involving taxes, tariffs, privacy and data security, anti-spam, pricing, content protection, electronic contracts and communications, mobile communications, consumer protection, information-reporting requirements, unencumbered internet access to our platform, the design and operation of websites and internet neutrality. After the closing of the Merger, we are also subject to laws and regulations affecting public companies, including securities laws and exchange listing rules.
 
For a discussion of the various risks we face from regulation and compliance matters, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business.”
 
Competition
 
The used vehicle market in the United States is highly competitive and fragmented. There are approximately 50,000 used vehicle dealers nationwide as well as a large number of transactions occurring in the peer-to-peer market. Competitors in the used vehicle market include:

· | traditional used vehicle dealerships, including those that may increase investment in their technology and infrastructure in order to compete directly with our omni-channel consignment-to-retail model;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | large national car dealers, such as CarMax and AutoNation, which are expanding into online sales, including omni-channel offerings;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | on-line and physical auction businesses, such as ADESA, Manheim, ACV, BackLotCars and several smaller independent auctions that compete with us for the supply of our vehicles;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | sales by rental car companies directly to consumers of used vehicles that were previously utilized in rental fleets, such as Hertz Car Sales and Enterprise Car Sales;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | car dealers or marketplaces with e-commerce business or online platforms such as Carvana, Vroom and Shift; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the peer-to-peer market, utilizing sites as Facebook, Craiglist.com, eBay Motors and Nextdoor.com.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our hybrid model offers the highest level of service, online or in-person. Buyers are not forced to decide how they want to interact with our platform before deciding to shop. Instead they have the option of switching back and forth between online and in person as they choose. Our non-commissioned sales model means that buyers feel comfortable asking for personal assistance when they want and trust that the sales coach who assists them is not motivated to do anything more than provide exceptional service. And because we source non-competitive inventory, our vehicle prices are on average less than traditional dealership prices, while our asset-light approach leaves CarLotz with limited risk.
 
 13


Insurance
 
We maintain insurance policies to cover directors’ and officers’ liability, fiduciary, crime, property, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability and umbrella insurance in each of the states that we have operations.
 
All of our insurance policies are with third-party carriers with financial ratings of A or better. We and our insurance broker regularly review our insurance policies and believe the premiums, deductibles, coverage limits and scope of coverage under such policies are reasonable and appropriate for our business.
 
Human Capital Resources
 
As of February 1, 2021, we had approximately 175 teammates, 166 of which were full-time employees, 4 of which were part-time employees and 5 of which were interns. All of our teammates are paid via W-2 and none of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have a good relationship with our employees and have not experienced any interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements. Most of our staff are at-will employees that can terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be difficult to replace.
 
We believe our success depends on the efforts and talents of our executives and employees. We rely on our senior management to execute our business plan and we rely on our sales and customer service employees to drive our supply of used vehicles. Our ability to attract and retain qualified executives and effective sales and customer service professionals is material to our business.
