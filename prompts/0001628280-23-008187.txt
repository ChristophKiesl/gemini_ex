Item 1.    Business
Overview
We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel life-saving therapies for life-threatening diseases or other public health threats for civilian, government and military use. Our United States, or U.S., Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved commercial product, NUZYRA® (omadacycline) is a once-daily oral and intravenous antibiotic for the treatment of adult patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, or CABP, and acute skin and skin structure infections, or ABSSSI, caused by susceptible pathogens. We retain worldwide commercial rights to omadacycline, with the exception in the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, where we have entered into a collaboration agreement with Zai Lab (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., or Zai. The National Medical Products Administration, or NMPA, of China approved NUZYRA for the treatment of adult patients with CABP and ABSSSI in December 2021. China's National Healthcare Security Administration added the intravenous formulation of NUZYRA® (omadacycline) to the country's National Reimbursement Drug List for treatment of CABP and ABSSSI in January 2023, resulting in millions of patients gaining access to this once daily broad-spectrum antibiotic.
SEYSARA® (sarecycline) is an FDA-approved product which we have exclusively licensed in the U.S. and the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, certain rights to Almirall, LLC, or Almirall. SEYSARA is currently being marketed by Almirall in the U.S. as a once-daily oral therapy for the treatment of moderate to severe acne vulgaris. With respect to our technology as it relates to sarecycline, we retain development and commercialization rights in all countries other than the U.S., the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, and in February 2020, we exclusively licensed from Almirall certain technology owned or in-licensed by Almirall or its affiliates that is necessary or useful to develop or commercialize sarecycline outside of the U.S. Almirall plans to develop sarecycline for acne in China, with a submission to the NMPA expected in 2023, according to Almirall.
NUZYRA
We believe that NUZYRA has the potential to become the primary choice of physicians for use as a once-daily broad-spectrum monotherapy oral and IV antibiotic for ABSSSI, CABP and other serious community-acquired bacterial infections where resistance is of concern. NUZYRA is used in the emergency room, hospital, and community care settings. We have designed NUZYRA to provide potential advantages over existing antibiotics, including activity against resistant bacteria, broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, oral and IV formulations with once-daily dosing, no dosing adjustments for patients on concomitant medications and a generally safe and well-tolerated profile. NUZYRA also has the potential to be used as a once-daily oral and IV antibiotic for the treatment of non-tuberculous mycobacteria, or NTM, and both the treatment and prophylaxis of pulmonary anthrax, as a priority medical countermeasure. 
To date, we have conducted more than 30 Phase 1 studies of omadacycline to characterize the effects of the drug on humans, including how it is absorbed, metabolized, and excreted. These Phase 1 studies also included evaluation in special populations such as patients with hepatic and renal failure. We have also conducted three successful Phase 3 clinical studies. Our first two Phase 3 clinical studies were for the treatment of ABSSSI (OASIS-1) and CABP (OPTIC). Both studies utilized initiation of IV therapy with transitions to oral-based treatment on clinical response. Our third Phase 3 clinical study (OASIS-2) was an oral-only administration of omadacycline in ABSSSI compared to oral-only linezolid. All three Phase 3 clinical studies resulted in omadacycline demonstrating positive efficacy results and a generally safe and well tolerated profile. These data formed the basis of approval for NUZYRA in the U.S. received in October 2018. The FDA subsequently approved our supplemental new drug application, or sNDA, for the oral-only loading dose regimen for patients diagnosed with CABP in May 2021. The sNDA included the results of a study to show that an oral-only loading dose regimen has a comparable pharmacokinetics, or PK, profile to the approved IV loading dose regimen in patients with CABP that was established in the OPTIC study.
In October 2018, we submitted a Market Authorization Application, or MAA, to the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, for the treatment of adults with ABSSSI and CABP caused by susceptible bacteria. Based on the review of the data and the application, the EMA recommended approval for NUZYRA for the treatment of ABSSSI but not for CABP. The EMA stated that a second study would be required for the CABP indication, which is consistent with European Union, or EU, guidance that typically requires two Phase 3 studies per indication for approval. In the EU, the ten-year market exclusivity for NUZYRA would begin with its first approval. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we withdrew our submission of the MAA to the EMA for NUZYRA to preserve exclusivity until such time as both the ABSSSI and CABP indications can be approved concurrently in an effort to maximize the value of NUZYRA in the EU. The CABP study required as a post marketing commitment by the FDA is designed in a way that it could support re-submission and approval in EU. The EU currently represents a modest market opportunity for ABSSSI and CABP compared to that in the U.S.. The EU does, however, represent a better market opportunity for NTM than in the U.S. Our goal is to secure a partner for the commercialization of NTM in the EU as well as in Japan. 
Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority Contract
In December 2019, we entered into the BARDA contract, which is a five-year contract with an option to extend to ten years. The BARDA contract could result in payments to the Company of up to approximately $303.6 million and consists of a five-year base period-of-performance and a total contract period-of-performance (base period plus option exercises) of up to ten years. The BARDA contract supports the development of NUZYRA for the treatment of pulmonary anthrax, FDA post-marketing requirements, or PMRs, associated with the initial NUZYRA approval, and the ability for BARDA to procure up to 10,000 treatment courses of NUZYRA for use against potential biothreats. In September 2021, we and BARDA modified the original BARDA contract, herein referred to as the amended BARDA contract, to provide additional funding to expand the development of NUZYRA under an FDA Animal Efficacy Rule development program to support a sNDA to the FDA to include post-exposure prophylaxis, or PEP, in addition to the treatment of pulmonary anthrax, herein referred to as the amended option.
Under the terms of the original BARDA contract, approximately $59.4 million was awarded to us by BARDA in December 2019 for the development of NUZYRA for the treatment of pulmonary anthrax and the purchase of an initial 2,500 treatment courses of NUZYRA. As part of this initial $59.4 million award, a $37.9 million procurement of NUZYRA was delivered to and accepted by BARDA in June 2021, and the amount earned from this procurement was recognized in net U.S. sales of NUZYRA during the second quarter of 2021. We have been periodically drawing down the remaining $21.5 million of the initial award based on costs incurred during the development program.
Two additional contractual services under the original BARDA contract were initiated by BARDA in March 2020 that awarded us approximately $76.8 million for reimbursement of existing FDA PMRs and approximately $20.4 million for reimbursement of manufacturing-related requirements, which we have been drawing down based on costs incurred. This additional staged funding is expected to support all FDA PMRs associated with the approval of NUZYRA, including CABP and pediatric studies, as well as a five-year post-marketing bacterial surveillance study, and support the U.S. onshoring and security requirements of our manufacturing activities for NUZYRA.
BARDA initiated the amended option in September 2021 that expanded the development of NUZYRA under an FDA Animal Efficacy Rule development program to support an sNDA that will include PEP in addition to the treatment of pulmonary anthrax for a revised total of approximately $31.6 million.
The second procurement, the purchase of an additional 2,500 treatment courses of NUZYRA for a total of $36.4 million, was delivered to and accepted by BARDA in December 2022. The amount earned from this procurement was recognized in net U.S. sales of NUZYRA during the fourth quarter of 2022.
The remaining government options under the amended BARDA contract include a maximum of approximately $79.0 million to provide for two additional purchases of NUZYRA anthrax treatment courses, each of which may be exercised at BARDA’s discretion upon achievement of specific development milestones related to the anthrax treatment development program. We and BARDA agreed under the amended contract on specific development milestones to trigger BARDA’s options for the third and fourth procurements of NUZYRA anthrax treatment courses. The third procurement will be triggered by BARDA's receipt of positive top-line data in PEP and treatment of inhalation anthrax from a combination of pilot and pivotal efficacy studies in animal models, which we anticipate will be available in 2024. The option for the fourth procurement will be triggered by our receipt of sNDA approval from the FDA for treatment of inhalation anthrax, which we anticipate will follow the third procurement by approximately 18-24 months. We plan to provide further specificity on timelines as the anthrax development program progresses.
We have made significant progress in the pulmonary anthrax development program under the amended BARDA Bioshield contract. We completed the first Animal Rule pilot efficacy study in 2022, which revealed that all three doses of omadacycline demonstrated one-hundred percent efficacy; all animals survived in an anthrax treatment model during which all non-treated animals died by Day 3. Three PK studies in rabbits and three more in non-human primates have also been completed. In addition, we have evaluated minimum inhibitory concentrations, or MICs, of omadacycline against over 130 anthrax strains. Omadacycline continued to demonstrate potent MICs and is considered effective against all isolates infected with anthrax that were tested, including a strain resistant to doxycycline and a strain resistant to ciprofloxacin. Omadacycline activity was not impacted by either of these resistant strains.
Together with BARDA, we also continue to advance our efforts to onshore the manufacturing of NUZYRA to the U.S. We have completed the knowledge transfer and development stage of our manufacturing process for the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, of omadacycline to our U.S. onshoring partners and are currently in the engineering stage of the initiative. We have completed knowledge transfer and the initiation of the process development work for production of vials. U.S.-based commercial supply production of tablets was implemented in 2022 and we anticipate these vials will be available by 2024. 
The BARDA contract contains a number of terms and conditions that are customary for government contracts of this nature, including provisions giving the government the right to terminate the contract at any time for its convenience.
Development of Omadacycline in Other Therapeutic Areas
Non-Tuberculous Mycobacteria Abscessus
We have discussed trial designs and potential registration pathways with the FDA to determine the efficacy and safety of omadacycline in patients afflicted with non-tuberculous mycobacteria abscessus, or NTM abscessus, which are environmental organisms that can be found in soil, dust, and water, including natural and municipal water sources. Infection occurs when a person is exposed to NTM organisms. NTM abscessus can form difficult-to-eliminate biofilms, which are collections of microorganisms that stick to each other, and adhere to surfaces in moist environments. Although severe infection can affect the lymph nodes, skin, soft tissues, bones, and joints, the vast majority of NTM abscessus infection cases are pulmonary. The diagnosis of NTM abscessus infection is often delayed due to non-specific symptoms and a lack of disease state awareness by clinicians. NTM abscessus is a rare and orphan disease with no FDA-approved therapies, which we estimate has a potential $1.0 billion addressable market in the U.S.
Mycobacterium abscessus, or M. abscessus, complex comprises a group of rapidly growing, multidrug-resistant, non-tuberculous mycobacteria that are responsible for a wide spectrum of skin and soft tissue diseases, central nervous system infections, bacteremia, and ocular and other infections. Infections caused by the M. abscessus complex are notoriously difficult to treat due to intrinsic resistance to many classes of antibiotics. Few oral antibiotics demonstrate in vitro activity against the M. abscessus complex, making long-term treatment of this infection extremely complicated. The M. abscessus complex is frequently resistant to antibiotics that are used in the treatment of other NTM species such as rifamycins, ethambutol, and fluoroquinolones. There is currently only one FDA-approved antibiotic for the treatment of the more common NTM species, MAC; Arikayce, an inhaled liposomal amikacin, has been approved for treatment of refractory pulmonary disease caused by MAC. There are no FDA-approved treatments for pulmonary disease caused by M. abscessus complex.
One of the key components of M. abscessus complex treatment is the use of three or more antimicrobials in most treatment regimens to increase drug efficacy and decrease the development of antibiotic resistance. Currently available treatment options for M. abscessus complex pulmonary infection are lengthy and require complex, multi-antibiotic regimens and are generally not tolerated and have significant safety challenges. General treatment principles that should be followed include: 
•Prolonged therapy (treatment for at least 12 months of culture negativity);
•An induction phase of therapy with a three- to four-drug regimen including one to two different active intravenous agents;
•A suppressive phase, which should involve at least two oral or inhaled antibiotics considered active based on drug susceptibilities since most patients cannot tolerate months of intravenous therapy; and
•The inclusion of a macrolide in the treatment regimen improves treatment outcomes and regimen tolerability against isolates without a functional erm gene, but high levels of macrolide resistance has been reported, thus, limiting effectiveness.
Omadacycline has several key characteristics that may prove beneficial to patients with M. abscessus complex pulmonary infection. These include:
•Favorable pharmacokinetics with both intravenous and oral formulations including high lung penetration concentrations and high intracellular pulmonary macrophage levels;
•Established safety profile in pre-clinical studies and Phase 3 clinical trials, including a class that is currently used for the treatment of NTM and chronically in many different disease states; and
•Potent in vitro activity versus M. abscessus complex.
Omadacycline has demonstrated potent in vitro activity against M. abscessus complex species in three separate studies. In the most recent report (Brown-Elliot 2020) the MIC50 and MIC90 values obtained against M. abscessus subspecies abscessus were 0.12 and 0.25 µg/mL. In two additional reports (Kaushik 2019 and Shoen 2019), the MIC50 and MIC90 values obtained were 1 and 2 µg/mL, respectively. Differences in the results of these studies are likely due to experimental methodology or isolate selection and is discussed further in Brown-Elliot 2020; nonetheless, in all cases omadacycline and tigecycline had similar, if not identical, MIC values. Multiple discussions have occurred with the FDA to design a program to support registration on NUZYRA for M. abscessus complex. General agreement has been reached on the key program and study design elements. 
In August 2021, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for NUZYRA for the treatment of NTM infections caused by Mycobacterium abscessus, or MAB, and Mycobacterium avium complex, or MAC. In October 2021, we initiated enrollment in a Phase 2B clinical study of omadacycline use for treatment of pulmonary NTM abscessus. This study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized monotherapy study of pulmonary NTM abscessus in patients who are not receiving other treatments and enrollment is proceeding as planned. Study size will be approximately 75 subjects randomized in a 1.5 to 1 ratio. Therapy will last for 12 weeks with an efficacy endpoint assessment at that timepoint. Due to the small numbers of patients with this rare disease, we expect this study will complete enrollment within approximately two years from commencement. 
The FDA granted Fast Track designation for the oral and IV formulations of NUZYRA for the treatment of NTM caused by both MAB and MAC in July 2022. The Company hosted an Investor Day in October 2022 that updated investors on the global market opportunity for NTM in both MAB and MAC, and laid the foundation for ex-U.S. partnering discussions. This event highlighted the significant global unmet medical need for patients suffering from this chronic, rare and life-threatening pulmonary disease, summarized key takeaways from the Company's ongoing scientific program in NTM that includes the first randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2b study being conducted in patients with NTM pulmonary disease caused by MAB. In February 2023, we held our fifth meeting in the last 12 months with the PMDA and have aligned on the registration program for NTM abscessus in Japan. The completion of this regulatory process is an important milestone in creating momentum in our ongoing discussions with potential partners in this country.
Other Data Generation
Data generation activities in 2022 progressed through collaborative research and medical affairs activities. We had 16 studies completed and 11 additional studies initiated or ongoing. The FDA has also approved two new antimicrobial susceptibility testing devices, including the first automated device, that included omadacycline. Collaborative 
research initiatives included the completion of year four of our post-marketing required surveillance study and evaluation of the efficacy of NUZYRA in combination with other standard of care agents in a mouse model of pulmonary M. abscessus infection. The investigator-initiated research, or IIR, program included the completion of the first real-world use registry and initiation of two additional real-world studies. Data generation activities resulted in the publication of 24 manuscripts that address the use of NUZYRA in special pathogens, populations or disease states that we expect will further define its therapeutic profile.
Data generation has continued to expand in early 2023 with additional evidence from our IIR program presented at scientific congresses.
Military research with the Walter Reed Army Institute for Research included the completion of an in vitro study that demonstrated omadacycline activity against multi-drug resistant clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae, two pathogens frequently isolated from U.S. military trauma infections. Omadacycline also demonstrated efficacy in a neutropenic mouse thigh model of A. baumannii,infection significantly reducing bacterial load compared to the untreated control. Ongoing efforts include the evaluation of omadacycline efficacy in a mouse model of malaria, as well as evaluation of the efficacy and PK/PD of omadacycline against A. baumannii in a chronic mouse wound infection study.
Sarecycline
Sarecycline, also known as SEYSARA in the U.S., is a novel, next generation, narrow spectrum tetracycline designed specifically for dermatological use. In July 2007, we exclusively licensed the right to develop and commercialize sarecycline for the treatment of acne to Warner Chilcott Company, Inc. (which was acquired by Actavis PLC in October 2013 and became Allergan in October 2015) and, in September 2018, Allergan assigned such rights to Almirall. In February 2020, we exclusively licensed to Almirall certain technology owned or in-licensed by us or our affiliates in order to research, develop and commercialize sarecycline for the treatment of acne in the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, or the greater China region. Almirall is responsible for all costs associated with developing and commercializing sarecycline for the treatment of acne in the U.S. and the greater China region. In exchange for such license rights, we have the right to receive (i) milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development- and regulatory-based events in the U.S. and (ii) a royalty on U.S.-based and greater China region-based net sales. With respect to our technology as it relates to sarecycline, we retain development and commercialization rights outside of the U.S. and the greater China region and, with respect to certain technology owned or in-licensed by Almirall or its affiliates necessary or useful to develop or commercialize sarecycline outside of the U.S. and the greater China region, we exclusively licensed such technology from Almirall in February 2020, all of which is available for licensing to other partners in key international markets, such as the EU, Japan, the rest of Asia (excluding the greater China region), Canada and Latin America. In the event we directly commercialize or sublicense a third party to commercialize sarecycline outside of the U.S. and the greater China region, we owe Almirall (i) a royalty on our or our affiliates’ net sales and (ii) a percentage of the consideration (e.g., milestones, royalties) we receive from our sublicensees in connection with their development and commercialization of sarecycline.
Almirall currently holds a nonexclusive license to develop and commercialize sarecycline for the treatment of rosacea in the U.S., and in the U.S., Paratek cannot grant rights on back-up compounds, lead candidate(s), or products licensed to Almirall for rosacea.
Corporate History
We are incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. On October 30, 2014, Transcept Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Transcept, completed a business combination with privately-held Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Old Paratek, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of June 30, 2014, by and among Transcept, Tigris Merger Sub, Inc., or Merger Sub, Tigris Acquisition Sub, LLC, or Merger LLC, and Old Paratek, or the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Old Paratek, with Old Paratek surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Transcept, followed by the merger of Old Paratek with and into Merger LLC, with Merger LLC surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Transcept (we refer to these mergers together as the Merger). Immediately following the Merger, Transcept changed its name to “Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc.”, and Merger LLC changed its name to “Paratek Pharma, LLC.” In connection with the closing of the Merger, our common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Global Market under the ticker symbol “PRTK” on October 31, 2014.
The Antibiotics Market and Limitations of Other Current Therapies 
Physicians commonly prescribe antibiotics to treat patients with acute and chronic infectious diseases that are either known, or presumed, to be caused by bacteria. The World Health Organization has identified the development of worldwide resistance to currently available antibacterial agents as being one of the three greatest threats to human health in this decade. In a press release announcing the completion of a study titled “Hospital and Societal Costs of Antimicrobial Resistant Infections in a Chicago Teaching Hospital: Implications for Antibiotic Stewardship,” it was estimated that antibiotic-resistant infections cost the U.S. healthcare system in excess of $20 billion annually. In addition, these infections result in more than $35 billion in societal costs and more than 8 million additional days spent in the hospital. Historically, the majority of life-threatening infections resulting from antibiotic-resistant bacteria were acquired in the hospital setting. According to AMR data from 2015 projected through 2028, approximately 6.7 million antibiotic treated events occur annually in the two combined indications of ABSSSI and CABP in U.S. hospitals. Furthermore, research conducted by Paratek suggests that in these same indications of ABSSSI and CABP there are approximately 890 thousand patients treated in U.S hospitals who fail to respond or are intolerant to the existing generic options. In the U.S. community setting, IMS NDTI data (2014-2015) projected to 2028 suggests there are approximately 23.7 million prescriptions for ABSSSI and CABP. Additionally, research conducted by Paratek suggests that approximately 2.1 million patients fail to respond or are intolerant to the existing oral generics in the U.S. community setting. The emergence of multi-drug resistant pathogens, coupled with limitations in terms of intolerance to existing generic options, emphasizes the need for novel agents capable of overcoming antibiotic resistance.
Bacteria are often broadly classified as gram-positive bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, and multi-drug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, or MDR-SP; gram-negative bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, or ESBL, producing Enterobacteriaceae; atypical bacteria, including Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila; and anaerobic bacteria, including Bacteroides and Clostridia. Antibiotics that are active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria are referred to as “broad-spectrum”, while antibiotics that are active only against a select subset of gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria are referred to as “narrow spectrum”. Today, because many of the currently prescribed antibiotics that have activity against resistant organisms typically are “narrow spectrum,” they cannot be used as an empiric monotherapy treatment of serious infections where gram-negative, atypical or anaerobic bacteria may also be involved. Empiric monotherapy refers to the use of a single, antibacterial agent to begin treatment of an infection before the specific pathogen causing the infection has been identified. Based on published epidemiology studies, rates of infections involving organisms other than gram-positive bacteria have been found to be as much as 15% in ABSSSI and up to 55% in CAP patients with confirmed bacterial etiology.
When a patient goes to the emergency room or hospital for treatment of a serious infection, the physician’s selection of which IV antibiotic to use is often based on the severity of infection, the pathogen(s) believed most likely to be involved and the probability of a resistant pathogen(s) being present. After initial IV therapy and once the infection begins to respond to treatment, hospitals and physicians face strong pressures to discharge patients from the hospital to reduce costs, limit hospital-acquired infections and improve the patient’s quality of life. In order to transition patients out of the hospital and home to complete the course of therapy, physicians typically prefer to have the option to prescribe a bioequivalent oral formulation of the same antibiotic.
Antibiotics used to treat ABSSSI, CABP and other serious, community-acquired bacterial infections must satisfy a wide range of criteria on a cost-effective basis. For example, we believe that other existing treatment options for ABSSSI, including vancomycin, linezolid, tedezolid, daptomycin, piperacillin tazobactam, dalbavancin, tigecycline and delafloxacin; and for CABP, including levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, azithromycin, ceftriaxone, clarithromycin, ceftaroline, delafloxacin, lefamulin and tigecycline; have one or more of the following significant limitations:
•Limited spectrum of antibacterial activity. Since it may take as long as 48 to 72 hours to identify the pathogen(s) causing an infection and most of the currently available options that cover resistant pathogens are narrow-spectrum treatments, physicians frequently prescribe two or more antibiotics to treat a broad-spectrum of potential pathogens. For example, vancomycin, linezolid and daptomycin, the most frequently prescribed treatments for certain serious bacterial skin infections, are narrow-spectrum treatments active only against gram-positive bacteria. The currently available treatment with a more appropriate spectrum for use as a monotherapy against serious and antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections is tigecycline, but it has other significant limitations, most notably dose limiting tolerability of nausea and vomiting.
•Lack of both oral and IV formulations. The most common treatments for serious bacterial infections, vancomycin, daptomycin, ceftriaxone, piperacillin tazobactam, and tigecycline are only available as 
injectable or IV formulations. The lack of an effective bioequivalent oral formulation of these and many other commonly prescribed antibiotics requires continued IV therapy, which is inconvenient for the patient and may result in longer hospital stays and greater cost. Alternatively, because of the absence of the same antibiotic in an oral, well-tolerated formulation, physicians may switch the patient to a different orally available antibiotic at the time of hospital discharge. This carries the risk of new side effects and possible treatment failure if the oral antibiotic does not cover the same bacteria that were being effectively treated by the IV antibiotic therapy. While linezolid is a twice-daily IV and oral therapy, it is a narrow-spectrum treatment that is associated with increasing bacterial resistance, side effects from interactions with other therapies and other serious safety concerns.
•Safety/tolerability concerns and side effects. Concerns about antibiotic safety and tolerability are among the leading reasons why patients stop treatment and fail therapy. The most commonly used antibiotics, such as vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, azithromycin, piperacillin/tazobactam and tigecycline, are associated with safety and tolerability concerns. For example, vancomycin, which requires frequent therapeutic monitoring of blood levels and corresponding dose adjustments, is associated with allergic reactions and can cause kidney damage, loss of balance, loss of hearing, vomiting and nausea in certain patients. Linezolid is associated with bone marrow suppression and loss of vision and should not be taken by patients who are also on many commonly prescribed anti-depressants, such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors and serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Daptomycin has been associated with a reduction of efficacy in patients with moderate renal insufficiency and has a side effect profile that includes muscle damage. Piperacillin/tazobactam is not used in patients with beta-lactam (penicillin) allergy while tigecycline is associated with tolerability concerns because of nausea and vomiting. Levofloxacin and moxifloxacin are associated with tendon rupture and peripheral neuropathy. In July 2016, the FDA approved changes to the labels of fluoroquinolone antibacterial drugs for systemic use (i.e., taken by mouth or by injection), stating “These medicines are associated with disabling and potentially permanent side effects of the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system that can occur together in the same patient.” As a result, the FDA revised the Boxed Warning, FDA’s strongest warning, to address these serious safety issues. They also added a new warning and updated other parts of the drug label, including the patient Medication Guide. Additionally, a May 2012 article in the New England Journal of Medicine indicated that a small number of patients treated with azithromycin and quinolones, such as levofloxacin or moxifloxacin, may experience sudden death due to cardiac arrhythmia, which is often predicted by a prolongation of the corrected QT interval, or QTc. The FDA issued a Drug Safety Communication on March 12, 2013 titled “Azithromycin (Zithromax or Zmax) and the risk of potentially fatal heart rhythms,” and the azithromycin drug label warnings were strengthened to address this concern.
•Increasing bacterial resistance. Bacterial resistance to the most frequently prescribed antibiotics (branded or generic) has limited their potential to treat infections, which often prevents their use as an empiric monotherapy. We believe that MRSA and MDR-SP, in the community have posed treatment challenges because of resistance to penicillins (resistance rate up to 100% for both), cephalosporins (100% and 11%, respectively, for ceftriaxone), macrolides (83% and 86%, respectively, for erythromycin/azithromycin) and quinolones (73% and 2%, respectively, for levofloxacin), particularly in ABSSSI and CABP. There have also been recent reports of resistance developing during treatment with daptomycin and concerns about an increasing frequency of strains of Staphylococcus aureus with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. Additionally, linezolid use has been associated with drug resistance, including reports of outbreaks of resistance among Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus strains. 
These limitations can ultimately lead to longer hospital stays, greater healthcare costs and increased morbidity and mortality due to lower cure rates and additional side effects. While certain antibiotics address some of these outcomes, we do not believe there is one superior treatment option that satisfies all outcomes. We believe that it is essential for the treatment of patients with serious, community-acquired bacterial infections that physicians prescribe the right antibiotic the first time, as ineffective antibiotics can quickly lead to progressively more severe and invasive infections or even death.
Attributes of NUZYRA
•Equivalent once-daily oral and IV formulations to support transition therapy. As identified through our clinical development program, the equivalent exposures of the oral and IV formulations permit transition therapy, which allows patients to start treatment on the IV formulation in the hospital setting then “transition” to the oral formulation of the same bioequivalent antibacterial agent once the infection is responding enabling the patient to be released from the hospital to complete the full course of therapy at home. We believe that transition therapy has the potential to avoid the concerns that can accompany switching from an IV agent to a different class of oral antibiotic and to facilitate the continuance of curative therapy at home. 
•Broad-spectrum of antibacterial activity. Omadacycline has demonstrated in vitro activity against all common pathogens found in ABSSSI, such as Staphylococcus aureus, including MRSA, Streptococci (including Group A Streptococci), anaerobic pathogens and many gram-negative organisms. Omadacycline is also active in vitro against the key pathogens found in CABP, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, including MDR-SP, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and atypical bacteria, including Legionella pneumophila. Based on the approved label in the U.S., omadacycline has the clinical and in vitro spectrum of coverage needed to become the primary antibiotic choice of physicians and serve as an empiric monotherapy option for ABSSSI and CABP where resistance is of concern. On the basis of the in vitro spectrum of activity demonstrated against NTM, we believe omadacycline has the potential to become an antibiotic of choice for the treatment of NTM. Omadacycline has also demonstrated in vitro activity against multiple biothreat pathogens such as Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, and others. 
•Generally safe and well tolerated profile. To date, we have observed omadacycline to be generally safe and well tolerated in clinical studies and the post-marketing setting. We have conducted a thorough QT corrected, or QTc, study, as defined by FDA guidance to assess prolongation of QTc, an indicator of cardiac arrhythmia. This study suggests no prolongation of QTc by omadacycline. Further, omadacycline is not metabolized in the liver or anywhere else in the body, thus reducing the likelihood of causing drug-to-drug interactions. Additionally, omadacycline has resulted in low rates of diarrhea, and we have not observed confirmed cases of Clostridium difficile infection, which can frequently occur from the use of other classes of broad-spectrum antibiotics such as beta-lactams and quinolones.
•Designed to overcome bacterial resistance. We designed omadacycline to overcome the two major mechanisms of tetracycline resistance, known as pump efflux and ribosome protection. This approach was via structure-activity relationship chemistry-based modifications of the seven and nine positions of minocycline. Our attempts to generate resistance to omadacycline in the laboratory suggest a low potential for developing resistance. In addition, our testing of thousands of bacterial samples in the laboratory suggests that omadacycline has not been affected to date by clinically relevant mechanisms of resistance to tetracyclines or to any other class of antibiotics.
•Tissue penetration. Omadacycline penetrates tissues broadly, including lung, muscle, and kidney, thereby achieving high concentrations at the sites of infection. Because omadacycline is eliminated from the body (as unchanged parent compound) via the kidneys and intestine in an expected manner, it can be used in patients with diminished kidney and liver function, without dose adjustment, and may have benefit in patients receiving poly-pharmacy, where drug-drug interactions are of concern. 
Omadacycline Post-Approval Requirements in the U.S.
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (21 U.S.C. 355c), or PREA, all applications for new active ingredients are required to contain an assessment of the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indication in pediatric patients unless this requirement is waived, deferred, or inapplicable. As part of the approval for NUZYRA, the FDA has waived the pediatric study requirement for ages 0 to < 8 years and deferred submission of pediatric studies for ages 8 to < 18 years. Specifically, the FDA has requested that we complete three pediatric studies in children ages 8 to <18 years, including a pediatric PK study followed by safety and efficacy studies in pediatric patients with both CABP and ABSSSI. The pediatric PK study was initiated in 2022. 
As is often required for antibiotic approvals, the FDA also required a U.S. surveillance study for five years from the date of marketing to monitor for the development of resistance to NUZYRA (omadacycline) in those organisms specific to the indications in the label in addition to pediatric requirements. Year three of the five-year surveillance 
concluded with no observed development of resistance to date in the indicated pathogens. Year four isolate collection has been completed and analysis of the data collected is ongoing. Isolate collection for the fifth and final year has begun.
Lastly, the FDA required a second study be conducted in adult patients with CABP. This study has been enrolling since February 2021, including at investigator sites in Ukraine and Russia. Enrollment in Ukraine and Russia has been suspended in response to the Ukraine-Russia crisis that began in February 2022. Identification and preparation of alternative countries and sites is complete, and these sites will begin enrollment in 2023.
NUZYRA Commercialization Strategy
We currently market NUZYRA in the U.S. as an empiric monotherapy in the indications of ABSSSI and CABP for patients that have both a known or suspected resistant pathogen and at least one significant comorbidity such as diabetes or renal impairment. We retain worldwide commercial rights to omadacycline, with the exception in the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, where we have entered into a collaboration agreement with Zai. We plan to pursue the continued global expansion of NUZYRA to select markets including Japan, South Korea and Europe, through collaboration or distribution arrangements focused on the rare disease indication of NTM.
Business Update Regarding COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively impact public health and economic conditions around the world and is continuing to affect our employees, health care institutions, patients, communities and business operations, as well as the U.S. economy. Certain COVID-19 related restrictions on in-person promotional access to health care institutions remain and the overall impact of COVID-19 restrictions on the health care and hospital environments could restrict the full potential of NUZYRA’s growth. The length of time and full extent to which the business and healthcare effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, any resurgence of COVID-19 cases, including as a result of variant strains of the underlying virus, the actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact, the availability and efficacy of vaccines against COVID-19 and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets. 
To date, we and our partners have been able to continue to supply our products to our patients worldwide and currently do not anticipate any interruptions in supply for the foreseeable future. We continue to assess the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our three clinical studies that have begun, our BARDA anthrax development program, as well as on our business and operations, including our sales, expenses, supply chain and other clinical studies. Our office-based employees are operating through a hybrid model of at-home and in-office work. Our customer-facing personnel have returned to operating primarily through in-person engagement. 
Our third-party contract manufacturing partners continue to operate their manufacturing facilities at or near normal levels. While we currently do not anticipate any interruptions in our supply chain, it is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic and response efforts may have an impact in the future on our and/or our third-party suppliers’ and contract manufacturing partners' ability to manufacture our products or the products of our partners and the cost of such products.
For additional information on the various risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to and Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included in this report.
Human Capital Management
Employees
As of February 28, 2023, we had 269 total employees, 268 of whom are full-time and 56 of whom were primarily engaged in research and development activities. A total of 27 employees hold an M.D., Pharm.D, or Ph.D. degree. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good.
Our Corporate Culture
We are driven by our mission to develop transformative medicines for patients with life-threatening diseases and solutions that lead to positive patient stories. Our vision is to be a leading independent biopharmaceutical company providing novel life-saving products for life-threatening diseases or other public health threats for civilian, government and 
military use. We were founded and continue to be built on our four core values: purposeful, passionate, resourceful, and collaborative. 
The foundation of our company culture requires us to always maintain our commitment to these core values. We have a shared commitment to act with integrity and take responsibly for our actions. All employees are responsible for upholding our reputation and conducting business to the highest legal and ethical standards. Ethical decision making is the foundation for how we do business. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, or the Code, describes fundamental principles to guide our actions and is designed to help employees make the right decisions. Consistent with our commitment to conducting our business ethically and compliantly, we have implemented a comprehensive compliance program governing our business operations which implements the principles set forth in the Code. To facilitate compliance with the Code, we have implemented a program of code awareness, training and annual review.
Fostering and maintaining a strong, healthy culture is a key strategic focus. Our core values reflect who we are and the way our employees interact with one another, our customers, partners and shareholders. Our Board of Directors, or Board, also provides oversight and guidance to support the continued focus on and importance of culture to our company. We are an equal opportunity employer. We do not tolerate discrimination against applicants or employees based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, marital status, sexual orientation, genetic information, citizenship status, disability, veteran status or any other characteristic protected by law. We prohibit discrimination in decisions concerning recruitment, hiring, compensation, benefits, training, termination, promotions or any other terms and conditions of employment or career development. We are committed to providing a work environment that is free from discrimination and harassment of any type. Each person, at every level of the organization, must act with respect and civility toward customers, coworkers, and outside firms.
Corporate Sustainability
We understand that delivering on our mission over the long term requires a focus on corporate sustainability, including environmental, social, and governance considerations. Specifically, we focus on the following:
•Patient Support: We are committed to ensuring our innovations reach as many patients as possible, as quickly as possible. We provide patient support and education programs.
•Diversity and Inclusion: We strive to promote diversity, inclusion, equal opportunity and personal development. As of February 2023, women make up more than half of our workforce and ethnic or racial minorities make up more than twelve percent of our total employee population.
•Dedication to Employees: We believe in the importance of investing in our employees’ health, safety, wellness, and ongoing professional development.
•Community Involvement: Supporting and giving back to the communities in which we live and work are at the core of our values. Through both corporate initiatives and individual contributions of our employees, we seek to make a difference.
Our Board sets high standards for our employees, officers and directors. Implicit in this philosophy is the importance of sound corporate governance. It is the duty of the Board to serve as a prudent fiduciary for shareholders and to oversee the management of our business. To fulfill its responsibilities and to discharge its duty, our Board follows the procedures and standards that are set forth in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which are subject to modification from time to time as the Board deems appropriate in our best interests or as required by applicable laws and regulations.
Our industry is highly regulated, and is governed by many international, federal, state, and local laws. It is our policy to conduct activities in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards as well as scientific research standards and guidelines.
Patient safety is our highest priority, and we are committed to providing safe and effective products to our patients. We work closely with government entities, like the FDA, to ensure the safety and efficacy of products and follow all requirements regarding manufacturing, registration, and promotion of prescription drugs.
Compensation and Benefits
Our compensation program is designed to align the compensation of our employees with performance and provides the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. To achieve our objectives, we evaluate our compensation program with the goal of setting total compensation at levels that align with our mission, industry, company size, and life stage. While we do not have a formal policy for allocating between long-term and short-term compensation, between cash and non-cash compensation or among different forms of non-cash compensation, we generally strive to provide our employees with a balance of short-term and long-term incentives to encourage consistently strong performance. To incentivize strong performance, two key elements of our employee compensation are variable—annual cash incentive compensation, which is earned based on our Compensation Committee’s assessment of our Company’s annual performance, and performance-based restricted shares, restricted shares, and stock options, which deliver value only to the extent the value of our stock increases. 
We believe that the most effective compensation program will promote company performance, encourage progress toward achieving our mission, and reward value creation for our stockholders. Our compensation program is designed to:
•attract and retain superior employees with the skills and values to contribute to our long-term success;
•provide incentives that motivate and reward the achievement of performance goals and that encourage retention; and
•align employees’ interests with those of stockholders by rewarding the achievement of short- and long-term strategic and financial goals, including those tied to short- and long-term value creation for our stockholders.
We offer comprehensive benefit programs to our employees that provide flexibility of choice through a framework of pay and recognition, health and wellness, financial well-being, work/life happiness, culture and community, 
and learning and development. We recognize and support the growth and development of our employees and offer opportunities to participate in internal as well as external learning programs.
We continually monitor employee turnover rates, as our success depends upon retaining our highly trained personnel. We believe the combination of competitive compensation and career growth and development opportunities have helped increase employee tenure and reduce voluntary turnover. 
Our recruiting practices and decisions on whom to hire are among our most important activities. We utilize social media, local job fairs and educational organizations across the U.S. to find diverse, motivated and responsible employees.
Paratek PROUD Recognition Program
The Paratek PROUD Program, or the Program, is a multi-faceted employee recognition program that recognizes and rewards employees for demonstration of our company values, significant contributions to the organization, and impact in the workplace. The Program's goals are to encourage employee engagement, build a supportive and active work environment and culture, drive operational excellence to enhance business outcomes, and retain top talent and increase company loyalty. The Program allows employees as well as managers to provide recognition through multiple vehicles throughout the year and recognizes service anniversaries and birthdays. The platform also establishes annual awards like the Center of Excellence and Paratek CEO Award.
Competition
NUZYRA 100 mg for injection and 150 mg tablets are distributed in the U.S. exclusively through a limited network of specialty pharmacy providers and distributors. This distribution process is designed to provide the best possible provider and patient experience and improve patient adherence to the indicated dosing. 
We have contracted with a third-party organization with extensive experience in delivering patient support services to help healthcare providers and patients access our network of specialty pharmacies and navigate the insurance process. 
Paratek also employs Market Access Account Directors who educate payors and hospital formulary committee members about NUZYRA and a Trade Team that works with our network of specialty pharmacies and distributors to assist in the execution of our distribution plan.
Three of the nation’s largest Pharmacy Benefit Managers, CVS Caremark, Express Scripts and OptumRx, have listed NUZYRA 150 mg tablets on their commercial formulary. Approximately 83% of insured commercial lives in the U.S. have coverage for NUZYRA 150 mg tablets with limited or no restrictions. Among those commercially insured covered lives, approximately 23% require a prior authorization. 
On October 1, 2019, NUZYRA 100 mg for injection was issued a permanent J-code under the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System, which is a standardized code system necessary for medical providers to submit healthcare claims to Medicare and other health insurances in a consistent and orderly manner. NUZYRA 100 mg for injection has also received transitional pass-through status from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or the CMS, which is intended to encourage the use of newly FDA-approved medical devices, drugs, and biologics to increase Medicare patients’ access to these innovative therapies by paying hospital outpatient departments more than the established facility fees. Pass-through status is temporary lasting at least two but not more than three years. 
Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and generic drug companies. We believe that our product candidates offer key potential advantages over competitive products that could enable our product candidates to capture meaningful market share from our competitors.
NUZYRA competes with other antibiotics in the serious bacterial skin infection market. These include, but are not limited to, vancomycin, marketed as a generic by Abbott Laboratories and others; linezolid, marketed as Zyvox by Pfizer Inc. and available as a generic; tedizolid, marketed as Sivextro; daptomycin, marketed as Cubicin by Merck Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and available as a generic; dalbavancin, marketed as Dalvance by Abbvie; oritavancin, marketed as Orbactiv and delafloxacin, marketed as Baxdela by Melinta Therapeutics, Inc.; quinupristin/dalfopristin, marketed as 
Synercid by Pfizer, Inc.; tigecycline, marketed as Tygacil by Pfizer Inc. and available as a generic; telavancin, marketed as Vibativ by Cumberland Therapeutics Inc.; ceftaroline, marketed as Teflaro by Abbvie; and generic trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and clindamycin.
Further, we expect that product candidates currently in review with the FDA, in Phase 3 clinical development, or that could enter Phase 3 clinical development in the near future, may represent significant competition if approved. These include, but are not limited to, CG-400549, under development by Crystal Genomics; GSK2140944, under development by GSK; nemonoxacin, under development by TaiGen Biotechnology; and brilacidin, under development by Cellceutix.
NUZYRA also competes with other antibiotics in the community-acquired pneumonia market. These include azithromycin, marketed as Zithromax and Z-PAK by Pfizer Inc. and available as a generic; clarithromycin, marketed as Biaxin by Abbott Laboratories and available as a generic; moxifloxacin, marketed as Avelox by Bayer AG and available as a generic; levofloxacin, marketed as Levaquin by Johnson & Johnson and available as a generic; tigecycline, marketed as Tygacil by Pfizer Inc. and available as a generic; linezolid, marketed as Zyvox by Pfizer Inc. and available as a generic; ceftriaxone, marketed as Rocephin by F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd and available as a generic; ceftaroline, marketed as Teflaro by Abbvie; delafloxacin, marketed as Baxdela by Melinta Therapeutics Inc; and lefamulin, marketed as Xenleta by Nabriva Therapeutics. We are also aware of various drugs that are or may eventually be under development for the treatment of CABP, including, but not limited to, GSK2140944, under development by GSK, and nemanoxacin, under development by TaiGen Biotechnology.
Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do, as well as greater experience in marketing products, discovering and developing product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Our competitors’ drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than our products or any other product candidate we may commercialize and may render our products or product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of our development and commercialization. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. Finally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our products or product candidates non-competitive or obsolete. 
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of any of our products, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing facilities in the foreseeable future. Our products are manufactured in synthetic processes from starting materials that have to date been generally available. 
The manufacturing process of omadacycline tosylate has been validated at commercial scale. The active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing process is a three-step synthesis followed by purification and salt formation. The starting material is minocycline, which is well characterized and readily available. We have entered into commercial supply agreements with commercial manufacturing organizations as described below, to manufacture and supply the drug substance, drug product and finished packaged product.
CIPAN
In November 2016, we entered into a manufacturing and services agreement with CIPAN – Companhia Industrial Produtora de Antibióticos, or CIPAN, and subsequently amended and restated such manufacturing and services agreement in April 2018 to include, among other things, an investment by the Company in a new facility area to increase the manufacturing capacity for production of crude omadacycline. The agreement, as subsequently amended, provides the terms and conditions under which CIPAN will manufacture and supply to us increased quantities of minocycline starting material and crude omadacycline, or the CIPAN Products, for purification into omadacycline and, subsequently, for use in our products that contain omadacycline tosylate as the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Under this agreement, we are obligated to pay a CIPAN Product price in the four-digit U.S. dollar range per kilogram for minocycline starting material and in the four-digit or five-digit U.S. dollar range per kilogram for crude omadacycline, based on the annual volume of crude omadacycline that we order, subject to adjustments as set forth in the agreement. CIPAN will also perform certain services related to development, technology transfer and manufacturing of the CIPAN Products as provided in one or more statements of work, which shall set forth the fees payable by us to CIPAN for such services. 
Our agreement with CIPAN will remain in effect for an initial term, as extended, after which the agreement will continue, with respect to each CIPAN Product, for successive renewal terms unless either we or CIPAN have given written notice of termination within a certain period prior to the expiration of either the initial or then-current renewal term. The agreement may also be terminated under certain other circumstances, including by either party due to a material uncured breach by the other party or the other party’s insolvency.
Carbogen
In July 2021, we entered into a supply agreement with CARBOGEN AMCIS AG, or Carbogen. The agreement provides for the terms and conditions under which Carbogen will manufacture and supply to us the active pharmaceutical ingredient for our omadacycline product in bulk quantities, or the Carbogen Product. Under the agreement, we are responsible for the cost and supply of crude omadacycline that Carbogen requires to manufacture Carbogen Product and perform related services. We are obligated to initially pay Carbogen an amount in the high six-digit U.S. dollar range per batch of Carbogen Product that we order, and the price may be adjusted in accordance with the terms of the agreement. We may also request that Carbogen perform certain services related to the Carbogen Product, for which we will pay reasonable compensation to Carbogen.
Our agreement with Carbogen will remain in effect for a fixed initial term and subsequent renewal terms (unless either party provides notice of its intent to terminate prior to the end of the then-current term). The agreement may also be terminated under certain other circumstances, including by either party delivering notice of termination following the initial term, or by either party due to a material uncured breach by the other party or the other party’s insolvency. 
Almac
In December 2016, we entered into a manufacturing and services agreement with Almac Pharma Services Limited, or Almac. The manufacturing agreement, as subsequently amended, provides for the terms and conditions under which Almac will manufacture, package and supply to us omadacycline oral solid dosage tablets in bulk form, or the Almac Products. Under this manufacturing agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to timely provide Almac with the active pharmaceutical ingredient needed to manufacture the Almac Products and perform related services. We are obligated to pay a supply price in the five-digit range in Great Britain Pounds, or GBP, per batch of the Almac Products, subject to adjustments as provided in the manufacturing agreement. We are also subject to an annual minimum revenue commitment in the six-digit GBP range. We will also negotiate with Almac, as part of each individual scope of work, the reasonable costs for the services to be performed for us by Almac. 
The agreement with Almac will remain in effect for a fixed initial term, after which the agreement will continue for successive renewal terms unless either us or Almac have given written notice of termination within a certain period prior to the expiration of the initial or then-current renewal term. The agreement may also be terminated under certain other circumstances, including by either party due to a material uncured breach of the other party or the other party’s insolvency.
Patheon
In July 2017, we entered into a master manufacturing services agreement and corresponding product agreement with Patheon UK Limited, or Patheon. The agreements, as subsequently amended, provide for the terms and conditions under which Patheon will manufacture, package and supply to us omadacycline in injectable form, or the Patheon Products. Under these agreements, we are required to deliver to Patheon the active pharmaceutical ingredient needed to manufacture the Patheon Products. We are obligated to pay a supply price in the six-digit dollar range per batch of the Patheon Products, subject to adjustments as provided in the agreements. Now that our omadacycline product has been approved, we are also subject to an annual minimum purchase requirement in the six-digit U.S. dollar range. If we desire for Patheon to conduct additional services other than those expressly set forth in the agreements, those would be subject to additional fees.
Our agreements with Patheon will remain in effect for a fixed initial term, after which they will continue for successive renewal terms unless either we or Patheon have given written notice of termination within a certain period prior to the expiration of the applicable initial or then-current renewal term. The agreements may also be terminated under certain other circumstances, including by either party due to a material uncured breach of the other party or the other party’s insolvency.
Research and Development
We have and will continue to make substantial investments in research and development. Our research and development expenses totaled $37.8 million and $30.4 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
In the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with third parties, such as contract research organizations, medical institutions, government agencies, clinical investigators and contract laboratories, to conduct our clinical studies and aspects of our research and preclinical testing. These third parties provide project management and monitoring services and regulatory consulting and investigative services.
Intellectual Property
The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our proprietary drug development platform, our product candidates and our discovery programs, processes and know-how are important to our business. We seek patent protection in the U.S. and internationally for areas such as composition of matter and the chemistries that allow for the synthesis of novel, substituted tetracycline compounds that exhibit significant antibacterial and/or anti-inflammatory activity, and any other technology to which we have rights, where available and when appropriate. Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties, and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.
Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection of our proprietary technologies and compounds, our current product and future product candidates and the methods used to develop and manufacture them, as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. Our ability to prevent third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products and technology depends on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology.
As of December 31, 2022, our patent portfolio of owned or exclusively licensed patents and applications includes 38 issued U.S. patents, 17 pending U.S. patent applications and corresponding foreign national or regional counterpart patents or applications. We expect that the patents and patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other government fees are paid, would expire between 2023 and 2041, excluding any additional terms from patent term adjustments or patent term extensions under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments.
NUZYRA (omadacycline)
The patent portfolio for omadacycline is directed to cover compositions of matter, formulations, salts and polymorphs, manufacturing methods, methods of use, dosing regimens, and modes of administration. The patents and patent applications covering omadacycline include patents and patent applications owned by us. The issued composition of matter patent in the U.S. (U.S. Patent No. 7,553,828), if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees are paid, was expected to expire in 2023, however, we believe that additional term for certain omadacycline patents may result from the patent term extension provision of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments of 1984, including the composition of matter patent which is anticipated to be extended until May 2028 and a method of use patent (U.S. 9,265,740) is expected to be extended until October 2030. Filings for both patent term extensions have been made with the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office. On February 17, 2023, the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office granted an interim one-year extension of the U.S. Patent No. 7,553,828 while they continue to review our petition for patent term extension. Omadacycline has received Qualified Infectious Disease Product, or QIDP, designation under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act, or the GAIN Act. This may provide up to an additional five years of market exclusivity layered with protection provided by the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, which GAIN also enables exclusivity to 2028. We expect that the other patents and patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, would expire between 2023 and 2041, excluding any additional terms from patent term adjustments or patent term extensions under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments.
SEYSARA (sarecycline)
The patent portfolio for our acne and rosacea program is directed to cover compositions of matter, methods of use, methods of manufacturing, as well as salts and polymorphs of sarecycline. Amongst other patent filings and granted patents, our patent portfolio includes issued U.S. Patent No. 8,318,706, or the ‘706 Patent, which covers composition of matter of sarecycline and issued U.S. Patent No. 8,513,223, or the ‘223 Patent, which covers methods of use for sarecycline, and corresponding foreign national or regional counterpart applications. The ‘706 Patent is expected to expire in 2032 (this expiry taking into account the expected patent term extension as provided by the Hatch-Waxman Amendments) and the ‘223 Patent is expected to expire in 2029, if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid. Filing for the patent term extension has been made with the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office. In February 2020, we finalized a license agreement with Almirall granting us exclusive rights to certain technology owned or in-licensed by Almirall or its affiliates that is necessary or useful to develop or commercialize sarecycline outside of the U.S., including exclusive rights in joint intellectual property and certain Almirall solely owned intellectual property.
Intermezzo
As of December 31, 2022, our patent portfolio of owned or exclusively licensed patents and applications includes four issued U.S. patents directed to formulations and methods of use. The issued U.S. patents expire between 2025 and 2029.
Trade Secrets
In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third-party. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data, trade secrets and know-how by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
Trademarks
We have registered trademarks and service marks or pending trademark and services mark applications in a number of countries for PARATEK, PARATEK & HEXAGON DESIGN, NUZYRA and its design logo, and other marks which we presently use or may use in connection with our pharmaceutical research and development as well as with our product candidates. SEYSARA is a trademark for which Almirall has registered in the U.S. and China and for which Paratek has applied for in a number of foreign countries. In connection with the ongoing development and advancement of our products and services in the U.S. and in various international jurisdictions, we routinely seek to create protection for our marks and enhance their value by pursuing trademarks and service marks where available and when appropriate. 
Collaborations and License Agreements
Our commercial strategy is to partner with established pharmaceutical companies to develop and market products for the larger community markets, while retaining certain rights to products aimed at concentrated markets, such as hospital-based products, where we may seek to participate in development and commercialization.
Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority
In December 2019, we entered into the BARDA contract. Refer to the section entitled Business—Overview—Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority Contract in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the BARDA contract.
Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
In March 2019, Paratek and Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Tetraphase, which later became a subsidiary of La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company, both of which are now a subsidiary of Innoviva, Inc., entered into a License Agreement, or the Tetraphase License Agreement. Under the terms of the Tetraphase License Agreement, we granted to Tetraphase a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under certain Paratek 
patents, to develop, make, have, use, import, offer for sale and sell the licensed product, or XERAVATM, which is a drug for the treatment of complicated, intra-abdominal infections caused by bacteria, which was approved by the FDA in August 2018. 
The terms of the Tetraphase License Agreement provide for Tetraphase to pay royalties at a low single digit percent on net product revenues of the licensed product sold in the U.S. Tetraphase’s obligation to pay royalties with respect to the licensed product shall be retroactive to the date of the first commercial sale of the licensed product in the U.S., which occurred in February 2019. La Jolla is currently selling XERAVATM (Eravacycline) in the U.S.
The Tetraphase License Agreement will continue until the expiration of and payment by Tetraphase of all Tetraphase’s payment obligations, which is when there are no longer any valid claims of the licensed Paratek patents that would be infringed, in the absence of a license, by a manufacture, use, or sales of the licensed product. The principal licensed patent under the Tetraphase License Agreement is expected to expire in October 2023.
Zai Lab (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.
In April 2017, Paratek Bermuda Ltd., a former wholly owned subsidiary of Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Zai entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement, or the Zai Collaboration Agreement. On December 18, 2019, Paratek Bermuda Ltd. assigned its rights under the Zai Collaboration Agreement to Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Under the terms of the Zai Collaboration Agreement, Paratek granted Zai an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize omadacycline, or the licensed product, in the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, or the Zai territory, for all human therapeutic and preventative uses other than biodefense. Zai is responsible for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of the licensed product in the Zai territory, at its sole cost with certain assistance from Paratek.
Under the terms of the Zai Collaboration Agreement, we earned an upfront cash payment of $7.5 million in April 2017, $5.0 million upon approval by the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA, submission in October 2018, $3.0 million upon submission of the first regulatory approval application for a licensed product in the People’s Republic of China in December 2019, and $6.0 million upon regulatory approval of omadacycline for the treatment of adults with ABSSSI and CABP in the People’s Republic of China in December 2021.We are also eligible to receive $40.5 million in potential future commercial milestone payments. The terms of the Zai Collaboration Agreement also provide for Zai to pay us tiered royalties at a low double digit to mid-teen percent on net sales of the licensed product in the Zai territory.
The Zai Collaboration Agreement will continue, on a region-by-region basis, until the expiration of and payment by Zai of all Zai’s payment obligations, which is until the later of: (i) the abandonment, expiry or final determination of invalidity of the last valid claim within the Paratek patents that covers the licensed product in the region in the Zai territory in the manner that Zai or its affiliates or sublicensees exploit the licensed product or intend for the licensed product to be exploited; or (ii) 2032, the eleventh anniversary of the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such region.
Almirall, LLC
In July 2007, we and Warner Chilcott Company, Inc. (which became a part of Allergan), entered into a collaborative research and license agreement, under which we granted Allergan an exclusive license to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize tetracycline products for use in the U.S. for the treatment of acne and rosacea. In September 2018, Allergan assigned to Almirall, its rights under the collaboration agreement, or the Almirall Collaboration Agreement. Since Allergan did not exercise its development option with respect to the treatment of rosacea prior to initiation of a Phase 3 trial for the product, the license grant to Allergan, which was assigned to Almirall, converted to a non-exclusive license for the treatment of rosacea as of December 2014. Under the terms of the Almirall Collaboration Agreement, we and Almirall are responsible for, and are obligated to use, commercially reasonable efforts to conduct specified development activities for the treatment of acne and, if requested by Almirall, we may conduct certain additional development activities to the extent we determine in good faith that we have the necessary resources available for such activities. 
Under the terms of the Almirall Collaboration Agreement, Almirall is responsible for and is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize tetracycline compounds that are specified in the agreement for the treatment of acne. We have agreed during the term of the Almirall Collaboration Agreement not to directly or indirectly develop or commercialize any tetracycline compounds in the U.S. for the treatment of acne, and Almirall has 
agreed during the term of the Almirall Collaboration Agreement not to directly or indirectly develop or commercialize any tetracycline compound included as part of the agreement for any use other than as provided in the Almirall Collaboration Agreement. 
The Almirall Collaboration Agreement contains two performance obligations: (i) an exclusive license to research, develop and commercialize tetracycline products for use in the U.S. for the treatment of acne and non-exclusive rights to rosacea and (ii) research and development services. The performance obligation to deliver the license was satisfied upon execution of the Almirall Collaboration Agreement in July 2007. All research and development services were completed by December 2010. 
We received an upfront fee in the amount of $4.0 million upon the execution of the Almirall Collaboration Agreement, $1.0 million upon filing of an Investigational NDA in 2010, $2.5 million upon initiation of Phase 2 trials in 2012, $4.0 million upon initiation of Phase 3 trials in December 2014, $5.0 million upon the FDA’s acceptance of the NDA for sarecycline and $12.0 million upon FDA approval of SEYSARA. No additional milestones are available under the Almirall Collaboration Agreement. Almirall is also obligated to pay us tiered royalties, ranging from the mid-single digits to the low double digits, based on net sales of tetracycline compounds developed under the Almirall Collaboration Agreement, with a standard royalty reduction post patent expiration for such product for the remainder of the royalty term. Almirall’s obligation to pay us royalties for each tetracycline compound it commercializes under the Almirall Collaboration Agreement expires on the later of the expiration of the last to expire patent that covers the tetracycline compound in the U.S. and the date on which generic drugs that compete with the tetracycline compound reach a certain threshold market share in the U.S. 
Either we or Almirall may terminate the Almirall Collaboration Agreement for certain specified reasons at any time after Almirall has commenced development of any tetracycline compound, including if Almirall determines that it would not be commercially viable to continue to develop or commercialize the tetracycline compound and/or that it is unlikely to obtain regulatory approval of the tetracycline compound, and, in any case, no backup tetracycline compound is in development or ready to be developed and the parties are unable to agree on an extension of the development program or an alternative course of action. Either we or Almirall may terminate the Almirall Collaboration Agreement for the other party’s uncured breach of a material term of the agreement on 60 days’ notice (unless the breach relates to a payment term, which requires a 30-day notice) or upon the bankruptcy of the other party that is not discharged within 60 days. Upon the termination of the Almirall Collaboration Agreement by Almirall for our breach, Almirall’s license will continue following the effective date of termination, subject to the payment by Almirall of the applicable milestone and royalty payments specified in the agreement unless our breach was with respect to certain specified obligations, in which event the obligation of Almirall to pay us any further royalty or milestone payments will terminate. Upon the termination of the Almirall Collaboration Agreement by us for Almirall’s breach or the voluntary termination of the agreement by Almirall, Almirall’s license under the agreement will terminate.
In February 2020, we entered into (i) an ex-U.S. License, under which Almirall, or the Ex-U.S. License, granted to us an exclusive license in and to certain technology owned or in-licensed by Almirall or its affiliates in order to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize sarecycline in all countries other than the U.S. and (ii) a license agreement with Almirall that is specific to the greater China region, or the China License, under which we granted to Almirall an exclusive license in and to certain technology owned or in-licensed by us or our affiliates in order to research, develop and commercialize sarecycline for the treatment of acne in the greater China region. 
Under the terms of the Ex-U.S. License, at our request, and subject to certain limitations, Almirall will provide us, our affiliates and our sublicensees with reasonable assistance in connection with our efforts to (i) source commercial supplies of sarecycline products, (ii) implement the then-current process for manufacturing sarecycline products at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers, including any updates to such manufacturing process, and (iii) qualify commercial suppliers of sarecycline products. 
Under the terms of the China License, Almirall is responsible for and is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize sarecycline for the treatment of acne and has certain time-based diligence requirements.
We and Almirall have each agreed during the term of the Ex-U.S. License and the term of the China License to use commercially reasonable efforts to not, directly or indirectly, make sarecycline products commercialized by us, our respective affiliates or our respective sublicensees available for resale in the other’s respective territory or territories. 
No upfront fees or milestones are owed in connection with either the Ex-U.S. License or the China License.
In connection with the Ex-U.S. License, we pay Almirall, on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, (i) for fifteen years following the first commercial sale of a sarecycline product in a country, a percentage of the consideration (e.g., milestones, royalties) we receive from third-party sublicensees in connection with developing and commercializing sarecycline outside of the U.S., which ranges from one-half of such consideration for sarecycline products for the treatment of acne to one-fifth of such consideration for sarecycline products for the treatment of other indications, in each case subject to a 50% reduction for any sarecycline product not in a solid oral tablet formulation for which Paratek or its affiliates have incurred significant development costs and (ii) for eight years following the first commercial sale of a sarecycline product in a country and a royalty in the middle-single digits on our or our affiliates’ net sales of sarecycline products outside of the U.S., subject to certain standard reductions. In connection with the China License, for fifteen years following the first commercial sale of a sarecycline product in China, Almirall pays us a royalty in the high-single digits on their, their affiliates’ or their sublicensees’ net sales of sarecycline products in the greater China region, subject to certain standard reductions. 
Both the Ex-U.S. License and the China License terminate upon full satisfaction and expiration of a party’s payment obligations under the relevant agreement. We or Almirall may terminate the Ex-U.S. License for convenience upon sixty days’ notice. Either we or Almirall may terminate the Ex-U.S. License or the China License for the other party’s uncured breach of a material term of the agreement on sixty days’ notice (unless the breach relates to a payment term, which requires thirty days’ notice) or upon the bankruptcy of the other party that is not discharged within sixty days. Upon the termination of the Ex-U.S. License by us for Almirall’s breach or insolvency, our license will continue following the effective date of termination, subject to the payment by us of the applicable royalty payments specified in the Ex-U.S. License (unless Almirall’s breach relates to a certain specific obligation, in which case, our license survives royalty-free). Upon the termination of the Ex-U.S. License by Almirall for our breach or insolvency or upon our voluntary termination of the Ex-U.S. License, our license under the Ex-U.S. License will terminate. Upon the termination of the China License by Almirall for our breach or insolvency, Almirall’s license will continue following the effective date of termination, subject to the payment by Almirall of the applicable royalty payments specified in the China License (unless our breach relates to a certain specific obligation, in which case, Almirall’s license survives royalty-free). Upon the termination of the China License by us for Almirall’s breach or insolvency or upon Almirall’s voluntary termination of the China License, Almirall’s license under the China License will terminate.
Tufts University
In February 1997, we and Tufts University, or Tufts, entered into a license agreement under which we acquired an exclusive license to certain patent applications and other intellectual property of Tufts related to the drug resistance field to develop and commercialize products for the treatment or prevention of bacterial or microbial diseases or medical conditions in humans or animals or for agriculture. We subsequently entered into eleven amendments to that agreement, or collectively the Tufts License Agreement, to include patent applications filed after the effective date of the original license agreement, to exclusively license additional technology from Tufts, to expand the field of the agreement to include disinfectant applications, and to change the royalty rate and percentage of sublicense income paid by us to Tufts under sublicense agreements with specified sublicensees. We are obligated under the Tufts License Agreement to provide Tufts with annual diligence reports and a business plan and to meet certain other diligence milestones. We have the right to grant sublicenses of the licensed rights to third parties, which will be subject to the prior approval of Tufts unless the proposed sublicensee meets a certain net worth or market capitalization threshold. We are primarily responsible for the preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of all patent applications and patents covering the intellectual property licensed under the Tufts License Agreement at our sole expense. We have the first right, but not the obligation, to enforce the licensed intellectual property against infringement by third parties. 
We issued Tufts 1,024 shares of our common stock on the date of execution of the original license agreement, and we may be required to make certain payments of up to $0.3 million to Tufts upon the achievement by products developed under the agreement of specified development and regulatory approval milestones. We have already made a payment of $50,000 to Tufts for achieving the first milestone following commencement of the Phase 3 clinical trial for omadacycline and a payment of $100,000 to Tufts for achieving the second milestone following our first marketing application (NDA) submitted in the U.S. We are also obligated to pay Tufts a minimum royalty payment in the amount of $25,000 per year. We are obligated to pay Tufts royalties based on gross sales of products, as defined in the agreement, ranging in the low single digits depending on the applicable field of use for such product sale. If we enter into a sublicense under the Tufts License Agreement, based on the applicable field of use for such product, we will be obligated to pay Tufts (i) a percentage, ranging from 10% to 14% (ten percent to fourteen percent) for compounds other than omadacycline, and a 
percentage in the single digits for the compound omadacycline, of that portion of any sublicense issue fees or maintenance fees received by us that are reasonably attributable to the sublicense of the rights granted to us under the Tufts License Agreement and (ii) the lesser of (a) a percentage, ranging from the low tens to the high twenties based on the applicable field of use for such product, of the royalty payments made to us by the sublicensee or (b) the amount of royalty payments that would have been paid by us to Tufts if we had sold the products. 
Unless terminated earlier, the Tufts License Agreement will expire at the same time as the last-to-expire patent in the patent rights licensed to us under the agreement and after any such expiration we will continue to have an exclusive, fully-paid-up license to such intellectual property licensed from Tufts. Tufts has the right to terminate the agreement upon 30 days’ notice should we fail to make a material payment under the Tufts License Agreement or commit a material breach of the agreement and not cure such failure or breach within such 30-day period, or if, after we have started to commercialize a product under the Tufts License Agreement, we cease to carry on its business for a period of 90 consecutive days. We have the right to terminate the Tufts License Agreement at any time upon 180 days’ notice.
Past Collaborations
Novartis Pharma AG 
In September 2009, we and Novartis International Pharmaceutical Ltd., or Novartis, which merged into Novartis Pharma AG, a wholly owned subsidiary of Novartis AG, entered into a Collaborative Development, Manufacture and Commercialization License Agreement, or the Novartis Agreement, which provided Novartis with a global, exclusive patent and technology license for the development, manufacturing and marketing of omadacycline. The Novartis Agreement was terminated by Novartis without cause in June 2011 and the termination was effective 60 days later. We and Novartis subsequently entered into a letter agreement in January 2012, or the Novartis Letter Agreement, as amended, pursuant to which we reconciled shared development costs and expenses and granted Novartis a right of first negotiation with respect to commercialization rights of omadacycline following approval of omadacycline from the FDA, EMA, or any regulatory agency, but only to the extent we had not previously granted such commercialization rights related to omadacycline to another third party as of any such approval. We also agreed to pay Novartis a 0.25% royalty, to be paid from net sales received by us in any country following the launch of omadacycline in that country and continuing until the later of expiration of the last active valid patent claim covering such product in the country of sale and 10 years from the date of first commercial sale in such country. The amended Novartis Letter Agreement resulted in a long-term liability in the amount of $2.5 million as of December 31, 2022 and $2.8 million as of December 31, 2021 included within “Other Liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheet. In addition, short-term liabilities of $0.4 million included within “Other Current Liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, represent the portion of royalty payments due to Novartis within twelve months of each balance sheet date. There are no other payment obligations to Novartis under the Novartis Agreement or the amended Novartis Letter Agreement.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the U.S. at the federal, state and local level, as well as those of other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, packaging, advertising, promotion, storage, distribution, and export and import of our products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulation require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Government Regulation
NDA Approval Processes
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and implements regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulation require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the FDCA and other applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject us to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include:
•refusal to approve pending applications;
•withdrawal of an approval;
•imposition of a clinical hold;
•warning letters, untitled letters and similar communications;
•product seizures or recalls;
•total or partial suspension of production or distribution; or
•injunctions, fines, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice, or DOJ, or other governmental entities.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices or other applicable regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
•approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated; 
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use, conducted in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCP, which are ethical and scientific quality standards and FDA requirements for conducting, recording and reporting clinical trials to assure that the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants are protected;
•preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA;
•satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s safety, identity, strength, quality and purity; and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA.
Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical or nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. In addition to including the results of the preclinical studies, the IND will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy determination. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the IND on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND and may affect one or more specific studies or all studies conducted under the IND.
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with cGCP. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol and any amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently in other situations, including the occurrence of serious adverse events. An IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol and any amendments before a clinical trial commences or continues at that institution, approve the information regarding the clinical trial and the informed consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be inherently 
too toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients with the target disease or condition.
•Phase 2. Clinical trials are initiated in a limited patient population intended to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
•Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for regulatory approval and product labeling.
Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points, including prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may also be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the End-of-Phase 2 meeting to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial or trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug. If this type of discussion occurred, a sponsor may be able to request a special protocol assessment, or SPA, agreement, a voluntary process the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the design of a Phase 3 clinical trial protocol and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim.
According to FDA guidance for industry on the SPA agreement process, a sponsor that meets the prerequisites may make a specific request for a SPA and must provide information necessary for discussion and agreement on the design and size of the proposed clinical trial. The FDA has a goal of evaluating the protocol within 45 days of the request to assess whether the proposed trial is adequate, and that evaluation may result in discussions and/or requests for additional information. A SPA agreement request must be made before the proposed clinical trial begins. If an agreement is reached, it will be documented in writing and made part of the trial record. The agreement may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins, except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the drug was identified after the testing began. Also, if the sponsor makes any unilateral changes to the FDA-approved protocol, the agreement will be invalidated. A SPA agreement is intended to provide greater assurance that if the agreed upon clinical trial protocols are followed, the clinical trial endpoints are achieved, and there is a favorable risk-benefit profile, the data may serve as the primary basis for an efficacy claim in support of NDA approval. However, SPA agreements are not a guarantee of an approval of a product candidate or any permissible claims about the product candidate, and final determinations of approvability will not be made until the FDA completes its review of the entire NDA.
The PREA requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for certain drugs and biologics. Specifically, PREA requires original NDAs, biologic license applications, or BLAs, and supplements thereto for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration to contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The FDA has waived the pediatric study requirement for omadacycline in children ages 0 to < 8 years because there is nonclinical evidence strongly suggesting that omadacycline would be unsafe in this pediatric group due to the risk of tetracycline-associated tooth discoloration and enamel hypoplasia, and the risk of tetracycline-associated inhibition of bone growth. The FDA has deferred submission of pediatric studies for ages 8 to < 18 (ABSSSI until 2024 and CABP until 2026) years because the product was ready for approval for use in adults. 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal safety studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the final drugs. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf-life.
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of a NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of user fees, but a waiver of such fees may be obtained under specified circumstances. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. It may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. NDAs receive either standard or priority review. A drug representing a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment or prevention or diagnosis of a serious disease or condition may receive priority review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Under that agreement, 90% of applications seeking approval of New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date on which FDA accepts the NDA for filing, and 90% of applications for NMEs that have been designated for “priority review” are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date. For applications seeking approval of drugs that are not NMEs, the ten-month and six-month review periods run from the date that FDA receives the application. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider a major amendment to the application following the original submission.
The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing complies with cGMP requirements to assure and preserve the product’s safety, identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendation. 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured and tested. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (such as active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP. In addition, the FDA may require, as a condition of approval, Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, restricted distribution and use, enhanced labeling, special packaging or labeling, expedited reporting of certain adverse events, pre-approval of promotional materials, restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising or commitments to conduct additional research post-approval. 
On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. If the FDA ultimately decides that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval, the FDA will issue a complete response letter to indicate that the agency will not approve the NDA in its present form. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 
Expedited Review and Approval
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track and priority review, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Generally, drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious diseases with the potential, based on nonclinical or clinical data, to fill an unmet medical need. Priority review is designed to give drugs that offer a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness of treatment for a serious condition an expedited review within eight months from the completed submission (six months from filing) as compared to a standard review time of twelve months from the completed submission (10 months from filing) for a standard new molecular entity NDA. Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track-designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review.
The GAIN Act is intended to provide incentives for the development of new QIDPs. A new drug that is designated as a QIDP after a request by the sponsor that is made before an NDA is submitted will be eligible, if approved, for an additional five years of exclusivity beyond any period of exclusivity to which it would have previously been eligible. In addition, a QIDP will receive priority review and qualify for a Fast Track designation. QIDPs are defined as antibacterial or antifungal drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including those caused by an antibacterial or antifungal resistant pathogen or qualifying pathogens identified by the FDA. Examples of pathogens that may be designated as a qualifying pathogen include MRSA, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus and multi-drug resistant gram-negative bacteria. Omadacycline (both IV and oral formulations) has been designated as a QIDP for complicated UTI, ABSSSI and CABP.
Beyond GAIN Act
In addition to the GAIN Act, the 21st Century Cures Act, signed into law in December 2016, established a new FDA limited population pathway for antimicrobial drugs that treat serious or life-threatening infections for which there are unmet medical needs. The U.S. Congress has initiated a significant number of other legislative proposals in recent years to provide further incentives in anti-infective development. For example, in December 2018, the Developing an Innovative Strategy for Antimicrobial Resistant Microorganisms Act of 2018, or DISARM Act, was introduced in the Senate to incentivize the research and development of advanced antibiotics through certain reimbursement-related incentives. It is possible that these or other proposals related to anti-infective development may be enacted into law in the future. We cannot predict whether or what legislative changes will be enacted or how they may impact our business and our products. 
Patent Term Restoration and Data Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drugs, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years for a single patent for an approved product as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. We have applied for restoration of patent term for NUZYRA and SEYSARA, as detailed in the Intellectual Property Section. 
Data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company using the drug entitled to data exclusivity as a reference listed drug, or RLD. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of data exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the use or conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs, for drugs containing the original active agent for other uses or conditions of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
In addition, under the GAIN Act, a new drug that is designated as a QIDP is eligible for an additional five years of exclusivity to be added to certain other exclusivity periods that the application may qualify for upon approval, specifically five-year exclusivity, three-year exclusivity, and orphan exclusivity.
Pediatric Exclusivity
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act provides for an additional six months of exclusivity, which is added on to patent and exclusivity periods in effect at the time the pediatric exclusivity award is granted, if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA, or a Written Request. The FDA may 
request studies on approved indications in separate Written Requests. The issuance of a Written Request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described studies. To date, we have not received any Written Requests.
Post-approval Requirements
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems, including safety issues, with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. The FDA and other authorities also strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products. Under the FDCA, the sponsor of an approved drug in the U.S. may not promote that drug for unapproved, or off-label, uses, although a physician may prescribe a drug for an off-label use in accordance with the practice of medicine. If we are found to have promoted off-label uses, we may be subject to significant liability, including sanctions, civil and criminal fines, and injunctions prohibiting us from engaging in specified promotional conduct.
Moreover, any drug products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things:
•record-keeping requirements;
•reporting of adverse experiences with the drug;
•providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information;
•drug sampling and distribution requirements;
•notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing or labeling changes;
•complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements; and
•complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements.
Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and some state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws.
Failure to comply with the FDCA and other applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject us to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include:
•refusal to approve pending applications;
•withdrawal of an approval;
•imposition of a clinical hold;
•warning letters, untitled letters and similar communications;
•product seizures or recalls;
•total or partial suspension of production or distribution; or
•injunctions, fines, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice, or DOJ, or other governmental entities.
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
Further, the global regulatory landscape is also subject to change as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the U.S. and global economies. The U.S. FDA and other health authorities have shifted resources and priorities to 
meet the many challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has also directly impacted the FDA and global regulatory agencies’ daily operations. For example, FDA temporarily suspended non-critical foreign and domestic inspections in March 2020 and announced plans to resume prioritized domestic inspections in July 2020. Pandemic-related disruptions could negatively impact the processing of regulatory submissions and slow agency review times necessary for the approval or clearance of new drug products. The duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic is unpredictable and difficult to assess.
Other Healthcare Laws
We may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Within the U.S., we are subject to various federal and state laws that seek to prevent “fraud and abuse” in the healthcare industry, including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. There is therefore a possibility that our practices might be challenged under such laws. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a prescription drug manufacturer from soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration to generate business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. False claims laws generally prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, any claims for payment for reimbursed drugs or services to third-party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) that are false or fraudulent. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that apply the laws to particular industry practices. Violations of “fraud and abuse” laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and/or exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid).
Laws and regulations have also been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers; require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government; and/or require disclosure to the government and/or public of financial interactions (so-called “sunshine laws”). State laws may also require disclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures. Manufacturers must also submit information to the FDA on the identity and quantity of drug samples requested and distributed by a manufacturer during each year. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our activities could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent federal and state laws and regulations.
Federal and state laws also protect the privacy and security of health information specifically or other personally identifiable information generally. The laws may apply to us or to healthcare providers and other third parties with which we interact.
Foreign Regulation
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the EU and Great Britain, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or economic areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time to obtain these approvals may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
Under the EU regulatory regimes, a company may submit marketing authorization applications under the centralized, decentralized or mutual recognition procedures, or under the purely national route of approval. Where the product is intended to be marketed in, one member EU state, a national application for marketing authorization is filed. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by biotechnology, designated orphan medicines, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, and those medicinal products containing new active substances for specific indications such as the treatment of HIV or AIDS and immune dysfunctions, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, and viral diseases, and is optional for other medicines that are highly innovative. Under the centralized procedure, a single marketing authorization application is submitted to the EMA, where it will be evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). A favorable CHMP opinion typically results in the grant by a single marketing authorization granted by the European Commission in an implementing decision, known as a centralized marketing authorization. A centralized marketing authorization is valid for all EU member states and, by extension (after taking the corresponding national implementing measures), in Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. In general, an initial 
marketing authorization is valid for five years, but once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period. Under the centralized procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization applicable by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops. Clock-stops allow the applicant the necessary time to provide additional information in response to the questions raised by the CHMP. The clock-stops considerably extend the time taken by the CHMP to complete the evaluation of a marketing authorization application. Ordinarily, within 67 days of receipt of the scientific opinion provided by the EMA, the European Commission will issue a binding decision on the marketing authorization application.
The decentralized procedure allows marketing authorization applications to be submitted simultaneously in two or more EU member states, whereas the mutual recognition procedure must be used if the product has already been authorized in at least one other EU member state on a national basis, and the applicant seeks progressively approval of the same medicinal product in one or more EU Member States. Both the decentralized and mutual recognition procedures provide for approval by one or more “concerned” member states based on an assessment of an application performed by “reference” member state. Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days of the receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s positive assessment report, each concerned member state must approve the assessment report and related materials, unless they identify a serious risk to public health. Under the mutual recognition procedure, the concerned member states have the same 90-day period to recognize the marketing authorization in the reference member state. The decentralized procedure contemplates a single clock-stop at Day 105, which may extend the process for completing the assessment procedure. In either case, if there is a disagreement between Member States during the assessment of the submitted data based on concerns about serious risks to public health, the Coordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralized Procedures will consider the matter and seek to reach a conclusion within 60 days. If this is not possible, the reference member state can escalate this issue to the EMA for arbitration. The purely national procedure results in a marketing authorization in a single EU member state. 
Following the UK’s vote to leave the EU, in Great Britain (being England, Wales and Scotland), all medicinal products with a centralized EU marketing authorization were automatically converted to Great Britain marketing authorizations unless marketing authorization holders opted out of this process. According to Article 5(4) of Annex 2 to the Northern Ireland Protocol contained in the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community, centralized marketing authorizations continue to apply in Northern Ireland. For three years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, the UK medicines regulator, may rely on a European Commission marketing authorization approval in the centralized procedure in order to expedite an application for a Great Britain marketing authorization. A separate application is still required, and marketing authorizations are granted by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.
Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists regarding the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and the adequacy of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities or government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private entities, such as managed care organizations, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Some third-party payors may manage utilization of a particular product by requiring pre-approval (known as “prior authorization”) for coverage of particular prescriptions (to allow the payor to assess medical necessity). If the prior authorization (medical necessity) is denied by the payor, the patient may not be able to afford the full cost of the medication without the coverage from the third-party payor. A third-party payor's decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain net price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular drug product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. 
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of new products and services in addition to their safety and efficacy. To obtain or maintain coverage and reimbursement for any current or future product, we may need to conduct real world evidence and pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the 
medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our product. These studies will be in addition to the studies required to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. We may also need to offer discounts or rebates to third-party payors. Thus, obtaining and maintaining reimbursement status is complex and costly.
Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of new price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our or our partners’ products or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our or our partners’ products could reduce physician usage of the product and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will continue to experience pricing pressures due to the increasing influence of managed care (and related implementation of managed care strategies to control utilization), additional federal and state legislative and regulatory proposals to regulate pricing of drugs, limit coverage of drugs or reduce reimbursement for drugs, and public scrutiny. While we cannot predict what executive, legislative and regulatory proposals will be adopted or other actions will occur, such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and profitability.
Within the U.S., we may be required to provide discounts or rebates under government healthcare programs or to certain government and private purchasers in order to obtain coverage under federal healthcare programs such as Medicaid. Participation in such programs may require us to track and report certain drug prices. We may be subject to fines and other penalties if we fail to report such prices accurately. 
In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally tend to be significantly lower. 
Health Care and Other Reform
In the U.S., there have been and continue to be a number of significant legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. Federal and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reform delivery of, or payment for, health care, which include initiatives to reduce the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Healthcare Reform Act, which expanded health care coverage through Medicaid expansion and the implementation of the individual mandate for health insurance coverage and which included changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs. We face uncertainties because there have been, and may be additional, federal legislative and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act. For example, tax reform legislation was enacted at the end of 2017 that eliminated the tax penalty established under Healthcare Reform Act for individuals who do not maintain mandated health insurance coverage beginning in 2019. The Healthcare Reform Act has also been subject to judicial challenge. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the latest judicial challenge to the Healthcare Reform Act brought by several states without specifically ruling on s the constitutionality of the Healthcare Reform Act.
Beyond the Healthcare Reform Act, there have been ongoing legislative and administrative reform efforts that affect pricing or payment for drug products or the healthcare industry more generally. Drug pricing and payment reform was a focus of the Trump Administration and has been a focus of the Biden Administration. For example, federal legislation enacted in 2021 eliminates a statutory cap on Medicaid drug rebate program rebates effective January 1, 2024. As another example, in 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or the IRA, contains numerous drug pricing and payment reforms. Among other provisions, the IRA requires manufacturers to pay a rebate to the federal government if prices for single-source drugs covered under Medicare Part B and most drugs covered under Medicare Part D increase 
faster than the rate of inflation. Other provisions will be implemented over the next few years – e.g., the IRA imposes a yearly cap ($2,000 in 2025) on out-of-pocket prescription drug costs in Medicare Part D; implements a new Medicare Part D manufacturer discount drug program in 2025; and, starting in 2026, creates a drug price negotiation program under which the prices for certain high Medicare spend drugs and biologicals without generic or biosimilar competition will be limited by a cap that is defined by reference to, among other things, a specified non-federal average manufacturer price. Such provisions could have a material impact on our ability to raise prices for our product and may adversely affect our profitability.
Some of the healthcare reform changes have been and may continue to be subject to scrutiny and legal challenge. For example, revisions to regulations under the federal anti-kickback statute would remove protection for traditional Medicare Part D discounts offered by pharmaceutical manufacturers to pharmacy benefit managers and health plans. Pursuant to court order, the removal was delayed, and the IRA further delayed implementation of the rule until January 1, 2032.
There have also been efforts by federal and state government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including legislation on drug importation. Recently, there has been considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals. There have also been recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs, which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices.
General legislative cost control measures may also affect reimbursement for our product candidates. The Budget Control Act, as amended, resulted in the imposition of (1%-3%) reductions in Medicare (but not Medicaid) payments to providers in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2031 (except May 1, 2020 to March 31, 2022) unless additional Congressional action is taken. Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented and/or any significant taxes or fees that may be imposed on us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
Adoption of new legislation at the federal or state level could affect demand for, or pricing of, our current or future products if approved for sale. We cannot, however, predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of federal and state reform efforts. There is no assurance that federal or state health care reform will not adversely affect our future business and financial results.
Government Contracts and Regulation
We currently contract with the federal government. The BARDA contract could result in payments to us of up to approximately $303.6 million and consists of a five-year base period-of-performance and a total contract period-of-performance (base period plus option exercises) of up to ten years for us to complete the studies and manufacturing activities necessary for the FDA to consider emergency use authorization NUZYRA to treat people exposed to anthrax. As a government contractor, we are subject to complex and wide-ranging federal and agency-specific regulations and contractual requirements that not only govern how we perform under the contract but also impose other requirements that affect our operations, including socio-economic obligations such as obligations related to affirmative action and maintaining a drug-free workplace. While many of our employees have been involved in working with government contracts previously, many of these government contracting requirements are new to Paratek as a company. Failure to comply with government contracting requirements could result in termination of our contract and the imposition of penalties.
