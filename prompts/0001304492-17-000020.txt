ITEM 1.  BUSINESS Overview 
 We are a wireless communications carrier focused on utilizing our spectrum assets to develop and offer next generation network and mobile communication solutions to critical infrastructure and enterprise customers.  Our Chairman, Brian McAuley, and Vice Chairman, Morgan O’Brien, were the co-founders of Nextel Communications (“Nextel”) and have over 60 years of combined experience in successfully developing regulatory driven spectrum initiatives to address the unmet wireless communications needs of businesses.  
 We are the largest holder of licensed spectrum in the Part 90 900 MHz band (i.e., 896-901 MHz paired with 935-940 MHz) throughout the contiguous United States, plus Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico.  On average, we hold approximately 60% of the channels in our portion of the 900 MHz band in the top 20 metropolitan market areas in the United States.  
 As our first priority, we have initiated and are currently pursuing a regulatory proceeding at the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) aimed at modernizing and realigning the Part 90 900 MHz spectrum band to increase its usability and capacity, including for the future deployment of broadband and other advanced technologies and services.  At the same time, we are exploring and developing network and mobile communication solutions, leveraging our spectrum, that address the unmet needs of our targeted critical infrastructure and enterprise customers.  For our first offering, we have deployed push-to-talk (“PTT”) networks and offer our DispatchPlusTM two-way radio service in seven major metropolitan market areas, including Atlanta, Baltimore/Washington, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, New York and Philadelphia.  DispatchPlus allows our enterprise customers to increase the productivity of their field-based workers and the efficiency of their dispatch and call center operations.  We are pursuing opportunities to offer additional network and mobile communication solutions to critical infrastructure and enterprise customers with our existing spectrum and currently available non-broadband technologies and, if we are successful with our FCC efforts, through the deployment of broadband and other advanced wireless service offerings.
 Our Business Strategy
 Our goal is to become the leading wireless communications carrier focused on developing and offering private network and mobile communication solutions dedicated to serving the needs of critical infrastructure and enterprise customers.  We intend to pursue this goal by executing on the following business strategies:
1. Increase the Efficiency and Capacity of Our Spectrum. Our spectrum is our most valuable asset. While our current licensed spectrum can support our deployment of narrowband and wideband wireless services, including our DispatchPlus service, many of the future business opportunities we have identified will require contiguous spectrum that allows for greater bandwidth than the less efficient current configuration of our spectrum band. As a result, our first priority is to continue to pursue initiatives to increase the usability, efficiency and capacity of our spectrum assets. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We acquired our nationwide spectrum position from Sprint Corporation (“Sprint”) in September 2014, and shortly thereafter, petitioned the FCC to modernize the 900 MHz band to permit us and other licensees in the band to introduce new technologies, including the global mobile broadband standard of LTE, to more efficiently support the market demand for high speed data, video and voice services.  Please see the section titled “Our Joint Petition for Rulemaking” below for a discussion of the status of our FCC proceeding.

2. Identify and Evaluate Next Generation Private Network and Mobile Communication Solutions. Complementing our pursuit of our regulatory initiatives, we are engaged in a number of business activities to prepare us for deploying next generation network and mobile communication solutions utilizing our current and, if we receive FCC authorization, future spectrum, including: 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Identify and Evaluate Available Technologies. Currently, we can utilize our spectrum, without obtaining further regulatory authorizations or rule modifications, with existing narrowband and wideband technologies, including the technologies we are utilizing to provide our existing DispatchPlus service, and services for machine-to-machine (“M2M”) and related Internet of Things (“IoT”) applications. In addition, our current licensed frequencies are located within a portion of the 900 MHz spectrum band that the FCC has designated for various land mobile radio (“LMR”) uses. Our licensed frequencies are also within the 3GPP global standard of Band 8 (also known as the E-GSM band, or 880 - 915 MHz paired with 925 - 960 MHz).  Band 8 has been internationally approved for the deployment of LTE technologies in numerous global regions, and so there is an ecosystem of existing LTE broadband devices and network components that we believe can be adapted for use on the contiguous spectrum we are seeking in our FCC proceeding.  We also believe that many of these devices and network components would be well suited for the work environment of our targeted critical infrastructure and enterprise customers, including network base stations, ruggedized smart phones, hardened data gateways and communications modules for IoT applications.  In our lab, we are continuing to test and evaluate the potential use of these devices and network components to assess their capabilities, functionality, pricing and any specification, modification or adaptation requirements to meet our target customers’ needs.  
 Identify and Evaluate Potential Use Cases.  At the same time, our team and the key industry consultants we have retained have engaged in an intensive outreach program to potential critical infrastructure customers to identify possible use cases for our spectrum.  These activities resulted in a number of discussions with prospective customers who are investigating ways to fulfill their existing and future network and mobile communication needs leveraging the benefits of our spectrum position.  


 
 Page 2

 
     As we expected, we identified a wide variety of both mobile and fixed use cases through these discussions that appear to be well suited to the coverage, penetration and capacity characteristics of our potential broadband offerings if we receive FCC authorization.  We anticipate that the FCC’s review process will afford these companies and other similarly situated companies with the opportunity to put on the record their needs and unique requirements for networks and services utilizing broadband and other next generation technologies.  
 A number of the potential critical infrastructure and enterprise customers we contacted have historically built, maintained and operated their own disparate and siloed communications networks, including private LMR and supervisory control and data acquisition (“SCADA”) networks on frequencies licensed exclusively to them by the FCC.  These entities commonly expressed their desire to retain the positive elements of their aging LMR and SCADA operations, namely tight control and custom features (such as specialized coverage and priority access), while adding the benefits of broadband and other advanced technologies (such as solving a broader set of use cases, providing high speed data and video services and economies of scale).  However, due to the general unavailability of low band spectrum (i.e., below 1GHz) that is not already licensed, these entities have limited opportunities to license or acquire the spectrum required to deploy broadband and other advanced technologies on their own.  
 Without the opportunity to develop their own next generation network and mobile communication solutions, many of our potential critical infrastructure and enterprise customers are pursuing other options, including considering the services offered by Tier 1 carriers.  The large consumer-focused carriers, in two instances well exceeding a hundred million subscribers each, enjoy clear economy of scale benefits.  However, the networks designed and operated by these carriers to primarily address the needs of their consumer customers may fail to satisfy the highly specialized requirements of large complex business organizations.  We believe that security, priority access, latency, redundancy control and unique coverage requirements are just some of the reasons critical infrastructure and large enterprise customers would be interested in obtaining the private network and mobile communications solutions we plan to deploy and offer if we receive FCC authorization.  
 We are continuing active discussions with our potential critical infrastructure and enterprise customers to better understand their requirements and determine how we can potentially deploy wireless network and communications solutions, utilizing current and future technologies, to meet their needs.  For example, we are currently exploring the development of a 900 MHz virtualized LTE and 5G network solution that could address the needs and use cases of our potential customers.  This approach could empower our critical infrastructure and enterprise customers to create and implement their own virtual private network and mobile communications services from a secure hosted cloud environment.  This approach could allow these entities to effectively keep pace with the evolution of mobile technologies and develop new services to offer to their customers, while leveraging the efficiencies of shared resources.
 In addition to identifying potential future customer use cases, we are exploring opportunities to cost-effectively offer network coverage and mobile communication solutions utilizing our existing nationwide spectrum position.  We have deployed and currently operate our DispatchPlus networks in seven major metropolitan market areas, including Atlanta, Baltimore/Washington, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, New York and Philadelphia.  In addition to supporting our DispatchPlus business, we are evaluating our ability to leverage this network infrastructure to support the next generation network and mobile communication solutions we elect to pursue in the future.  
 Continue to Identify and Evaluate New Opportunities. The wireless communications industry is highly competitive, and subject to rapid regulatory, technological and market changes.  A key part of our business strategy is to continually monitor changes in the wireless industry, and evaluate how these changes could enable us to maximize the use of our spectrum assets.  For example, recent FCC decisions have created significant opportunities for blocks of shared, unlicensed spectrum, both below 1 GHz to a limited extent and, in very large amounts, above 1 GHz.  While we intend to build our existing and future business strategies around our 900 MHz licensed spectrum, our ability to combine our licensed 900 MHz spectrum with additional spectrum in one or more unlicensed bands could provide us with a chance to offer potential customers the best of both worlds.  On the one hand, our licensed 900 MHz spectrum offers us absolute control over access to and use of that spectrum, allowing us to provide customers with guaranteed levels of service and the ability to prescribe and enforce purpose-built “rules of the road” for the provision of services.  On the other hand, the addition of unlicensed spectrum, particularly in large swaths that support very high speed services, could bring capacity and capabilities that exceed the limits of our licensed spectrum.  As a result, we are evaluating potential combinations of unlicensed spectrum with our 900 MHz licensed spectrum to enable us to develop and to market optimum services for our potential critical infrastructure and enterprise customers.
 As another example, we are exploring potential opportunities to provide IoT services.  Our team, assisted by our industry consultants, are evaluating the many ways we could potentially address future IoT opportunities.  In particular, we are focusing on opportunities related to key elements of modernizing the smart grid, including field area networks, sensors and meters and similar end-point devices that may perform best on a private wireless network.  Although these activities, and the precise contours of specific IoT business opportunities, remain in the very preliminary stages, we are orienting our efforts in this area around identifying those customers who would likely place the highest value on obtaining services from a private wireless carrier dedicated to their needs.

3. Differentiate Our Near-Term Communication Solutions with pdvConnectTM and Continue to Develop Our DispatchPlus Business. pdvConnect is our proprietary, cloud-based mobile resource management solution that enables businesses to locate, communicate and manage their field workers and assets. As part of our DispatchPlus service offerings, we include our Page 3 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


pdvConnect solutions, that were designed for dispatch communications. These solutions help to provide a differentiated offering when compared to our competition. We continue to believe in the competitive advantages of our DispatchPlus service and our ability to increase the revenues and operating results from this business. At the same time, we intend to remain disciplined in our approach to investing strategically in our DispatchPlus business. Once we have successfully demonstrated acceptable levels of sales productivity and financial performance in our initial markets, we intend, subject to developments regarding FCC action on our petition, to further expand and enhance our geographic market presence in other attractive market areas. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. Continue to Leverage the Experience and Relationships of Our Executive Team. Our senior executive team has a long, proven track record in the network and mobile communications industry. Brian McAuley and Morgan O’Brien, our Chairman and Vice Chairman, respectively, were the co-founders of Nextel. At Nextel, they were responsible for developing and operating the first all-digital nationwide wireless network that brought PTT to the mass business market. Nextel built its business by identifying an underserved market segment, and despite the competition, creating a better solution for potential customers in this market segment. After growing the total number of subscribers to approximately 23 million, Nextel merged with Sprint in August 2005 at a stand-alone value of approximately $36 billion. Mr. McAuley went on to found NeoWorld Communications in 1999, which was subsequently purchased by Nextel in 2003. In addition, several members of our current management team held leadership roles at Nextel, including John Pescatore, our President and Chief Executive Officer. We intend to leverage the experience of our executive team to refine and execute on our business strategy, to achieve our regulatory spectrum goals and to identify and pursue business opportunities to provide next generation network and mobile communications solutions for critical infrastructure and enterprise customers.

  Our Joint Petition for Rulemaking.  
 FCC Proceeding. In November 2014, we and the Enterprise Wireless Alliance (“EWA”) submitted a Joint Petition for Rulemaking to the FCC to propose the realignment of a portion of the 900 MHz band from narrowband to broadband.  We welcomed EWA’s partnership because of its multi-decade role as a trade association representing the spectrum interests of a broad range of business enterprise, critical infrastructure and commercial service providers.  We and EWA believe this realignment is consistent with the FCC’s mandate to promote more efficient use of limited spectrum resources generally and its ongoing efforts to make more spectrum available for broadband services specifically, particularly in the spectrum bands below 1 GHz.  In response to the Joint Petition for Rulemaking, the FCC issued a public notice requesting comments from interested parties and asked a number of questions about the proposal. A number of parties, including several incumbent licensees, filed comments with the FCC expressing their views, including both support and opposition.  Some raised technical and other questions about the proposal.  In May 2015, we and the EWA filed proposed rules with the FCC related to our Joint Petition for Rulemaking.  Comments on the proposed rules were filed in June 2015 and reply comments in July 2015. The proposed rules outline our recommended procedural and technical operating parameters, including field strength limits, processes related to the administration and sequencing of the proposed realignment of the 900 MHz band, and requirements for the broadband operators to provide comparable facilities to incumbent licensees, to pay the cost of their realignment, and to utilize an emission mask with advanced filtering capability specifically designed to protect licensees adjacent to the proposed broadband portion of the 900 MHz band.   
 In September 2016, an item was placed on circulation with the Commissioners’ offices at the FCC related to the Joint Petition.  We are currently waiting for the FCC to vote on and, if adopted, release the text of its decision.  The FCC’s action may take a number of forms ranging from a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, to a Notice of Inquiry, to a dismissal of the Joint Petition without further action.  Although the FCC has not announced a decision on the Joint Petition, we currently believe that the most likely outcome is that the FCC will adopt a Notice of Inquiry as the next step in the process.  A Notice of Inquiry is a vehicle for the FCC to gather additional information for the record.  If the FCC elects to adopt a Notice of Inquiry, it could request additional information and input on the optimal use of the 900 MHz band generally.  A Notice of Inquiry could also request information on the specific issues and proposed solutions raised by us and other commentators in the Joint Petition proceeding, as well as in other proceedings involving the 900 MHz spectrum that were initiated by third parties.   The adoption of a Notice of Inquiry would not mean that the FCC has accepted or denied our Joint Petition, or that our Joint Petition will or will not ultimately result in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.  We continue to believe in the merits of our proposal, and that our Joint Petition is consistent with the FCC’s practices and policies.  Nevertheless, obtaining a favorable result from the FCC may take a significant amount of time and resources. Moreover, there is no assurance that the FCC will ultimately approve our Joint Petition or will conduct a rulemaking proceeding along the lines originally advocated by us. 
 Meetings with Incumbents. To support our Joint Petition, we have met, and intend to continue to meet, with a number of incumbent licensees, critical infrastructure enterprises, and other interested parties in the 900 MHz band, including a number of those who submitted comments to the FCC regarding our Joint Petition for Rulemaking.  Our goals with these discussions are: to develop a better understanding of their business needs and overall requirements for wireless solutions; to gain a better understanding of the size of the incumbent base and the nature of the systems they are currently operating; to determine the interest that particular critical infrastructure entities might have in gaining access to wireless broadband capabilities to complement their own business operations and initiatives (for example, supporting power grid modernization requirements or monitoring and/or controlling their own system or network elements via machine-to-machine type services); and to propose voluntary license relocation opportunities to certain incumbents.  With certain incumbent licensees, we are continuing to attempt to build consensus and to resolve any concerns they have expressed regarding our Joint Petition; with others, we are soliciting their support and cooperation to structure and implement mutually beneficial relocations; and with select critical infrastructure enterprises, we are jointly investigating how our contemplated

     future broadband capabilities could be employed to meet their anticipated needs and future operating plans. We anticipate that the next stage of the FCC’s review process will afford these companies and other similarly situated companies with the opportunity to put on the record their needs and unique requirements for broadband and other next generation technologies.  
 Technology Evaluation.  Our engineering team has also evaluated the technical requirements for our deployment of both current narrowband and wideband solutions, as well as future broadband technologies in the 900 MHz band and specifically, whether existing technologies can be utilized to support our planned network buildout and business plans.  Based on these evaluations, we believe we can deploy a broadband network using spectrum in the 900 MHz band with technologies that are commercially available.  Further, based on our evaluation and testing of available technologies and equipment, we believe that success in achieving appropriate contiguous spectrum holdings is and will remain the most critical factor in determining whether we will be able to deploy and offer broadband or other advanced wireless services in the future.  
 Acquiring Spectrum Assets.  In addition, we have completed a limited number of spectrum acquisitions to support our current and contemplated realignment efforts and the deployment of a future broadband network.  We have prioritized, and intend to continue to prioritize, our acquisitions of spectrum licenses, including SMR blocks and site-specific licenses, in major metropolitan areas that we believe will ease the process of realigning a portion of the 900 MHz spectrum from narrowband to broadband, assuming the FCC approves our Joint Petition for Rulemaking. To date, we have pursued these acquisitions opportunistically and selectively to help avoid unduly increasing the cost of the spectrum licenses we acquire.
 Our Spectrum Assets 
 We are the largest holder of FCC licenses in the Part 90 900 MHz band, with a nationwide footprint in the contiguous United States, plus Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico.  We acquired our 900 MHz spectrum and certain related equipment from Sprint in September 2014 for $100 million, which we paid in the form of $90 million in cash and $10 million in shares of our common stock.  We estimate that we acquired our 900 MHz spectrum for approximately $0.06 per MHz for each person in the U.S. population (“MHz/Pop”) in our licensed market areas.
 The FCC has allocated approximately 10 MHz of spectrum in our portion of the 900 MHz band, sub-divided into 40, 10-channel blocks of contiguous channels alternating between blocks designated for operation of Specialized Mobile Radio (“SMR”) commercial systems and blocks designated for Business/Industrial/Land Transportation (“B/ILT”) users, with FCC rules also enabling B/ILT licenses to be converted to SMR use.  Subsequently, the FCC conducted overlay auctions on the SMR designated blocks that awarded geographic based licenses on a Major Trading Area (“MTA”) basis while affording operational protection to incumbent, site-based licensees in those areas. The 20 blocks of B/ILT channels have not been auctioned and all licenses remain site-based.
 We hold, on average, approximately 60% of the total number of 900 MHz SMR and B/ILT channels in the top 20 metropolitan markets in the United States, which includes approximately 70% of the U.S. population. We also hold almost every 900 MHz SMR MTA geographic license in all but a few markets in the United States, as well as certain B/ILT and converted B/ILT licenses in most major markets.  As a result, we hold on average, 240 of the 399 total channels in this 10 MHz portion of the 900 MHz band in the top 20 metropolitan markets in the United States. 
 Our DispatchPlus Business
 In Fiscal 2016, we began offering our commercial PTT service, which we market as DispatchPlus, in seven major metropolitan areas throughout the United States, including Atlanta, Baltimore/Washington, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, New York and Philadelphia.  We developed DispatchPlus to address the needs of enterprises that value a tailored PTT solution addressing the management of their mobile workforce. These businesses typically operate within industry verticals such as construction, distribution, transportation, field services, waste management and hospitality. Given the nature of their operations, DispatchPlus offers these businesses several advantages over telephony and data-based services, including an easy-to-operate one-touch button, efficiency of communications and rugged equipment optimal for field use.  The operation of our DispatchPlus business is separate from, and not contingent on, the initiatives we are pursuing at the FCC or our other spectrum-related activities.
 Our DispatchPlus Service.  Our DispatchPlus service combines pdvConnect, our proprietary suite of mobile communication and workforce management applications, with state-of-the-art digital network architecture and mobile devices supplied by Motorola Solutions, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Motorola”). Developed for dispatch-centric businesses, and historically offered to customers who utilize Tier 1 cellular networks, pdvConnect is an easy to use and efficient mobile communication and workforce management solution that enables businesses to locate and communicate with their field workers and improve the documentation of work events and job status.  DispatchPlus gives customers the ability to instantly set up PTT communications – either privately (one-to-one) or with a group (one-to-many) – within their calling area with just the touch of a “button.”  In addition, DispatchPlus can help customers increase productivity through the delivery of real-time information from mobile workers to dispatch operators, including Global Positioning System (“GPS”) tracking and real time location, worker status, activity reporting and field event logging.  DispatchPlus can also integrate with corporate intranets and back-office systems, such as sales force automation, order entry, inventory tracking and customer relationship management.  DispatchPlus allows customers to deliver voice messages to any computer (via the internet), email address or to any phone in the U.S., thereby greatly enhancing the PTT communication capabilities of field workers and allowing them to communicate not only with personnel within their organizations, but also with suppliers, vendors and customers.  

 
 Page 5

 
     Also built with the commercial dispatch customer in mind, Motorola’s digital network architecture allows us to provide highly reliable, instant and wide-area PTT communication services to our customers. 
 Because our mobile workforce applications are cloud-based, there is no requirement for our customers to download software to their two-way radios before beginning to use DispatchPlus.  We offer customers our DispatchPlus service at a competitive monthly price that we believe is more attractive than the price they would pay for comparable services and functionality from the large Tier 1 carriers.
 We intend to continue to enhance DispatchPlus and our future wireless business solutions to meet the demands of our customers based on their industry and individualized business needs. We also back our services with an enterprise-grade, dedicated customer support team.     Competitive Advantages.  Currently, many of our target customers use PTT services provided by Tier 1 cellular carriers via cellular systems or SMR operators via local radio networks.  We believe our proprietary DispatchPlus service offers significant advantages to our target customers when compared to the services currently offered by Tier 1 cellular carriers or local SMR operators. Specifically, we believe our DispatchPlus solution is superior to the current services provided by the Tier 1 carriers due to several key factors, including a lower monthly price for comparable functionality (including GPS and mobile workforce solutions), the simplicity and durability of our purpose-built devices that allow for one-button dispatch calls (one-to-one and one-to-many), the quality and functionality of our PTT service and our enterprise-grade, dedicated customer support team with specific expertise in dispatch communications and mobile resource management solutions.  Similarly, we believe our DispatchPlus solution is superior to the products offered by local SMR operators due to several key factors, including our opportunity to offer our customers consistent service across a greater coverage area given our national spectrum position, our proprietary DispatchPlus mobile resource management solutions being included as part of our service offerings, a number of which are differentiated and not available on local SMR networks and our substantial spectrum holdings generally being able to support significantly more customers per target market than the limited spectrum held by most SMR operators.
 Our Sales and Marketing Strategy.  Generally, the markets we have selected to target for our DispatchPlus service are small and medium-sized businesses with fewer than 1,000 employees that operate in industry verticals that, given the nature of their business and their asset and human resource profile, have historically utilized and relied on PTT dispatch services to maintain contact with and manage their dispersed mobile workforces. We believe our DispatchPlus service can provide these businesses with the instant communication services they need, and, coupled with our bundled mobile resource management solution, the speed and simplicity they need to operate efficiently. Our services are primarily billed on a monthly basis. 
 We market pdvConnect through two Tier 1 carriers in the United States. We previously marketed pdvConnect through an international Tier 1 carrier in Mexico until our agreement with this carrier ended during the second quarter of Fiscal 2016. We have entered into standard reseller, co-marketing and license agreements with these third-party Tier 1 carriers. Our Tier 1 carrier partners market pdvConnect as an available application to complement their wireless service offerings. Generally, pdvConnect has been offered at a monthly price of up to $19.99 per user. For the year ended March 31, 2017, our operating revenues were derived entirely from domestic sales. Revenues from the two domestic carriers accounted for 38% and 10% of our operating revenues for Fiscal 2017, respectively. Given our focus on offering our DispatchPlus service on our PTT network, we believe that sales of pdvConnect through our third-party carriers will continue to decrease as an overall percentage of our operating revenues.
 We primarily offer our DispatchPlus service to customers indirectly through third-party sales representatives.  We are currently selecting our indirect sales representatives from Motorola’s nationwide dealer network and from select other third-party wireless dealers.  We support our indirect sales representatives by providing them with training, sales, marketing and advertising support from our internal sales and marketing team.  We also support our indirect sales representatives by placing a dealer manager in each market in which we operate.  In addition, we are implementing a number of sales initiatives, including multiple types of lead generation programs and hiring additional direct sales resources. We believe this approach of utilizing existing wireless dealers, to serve as our indirect sales representatives, coupled with our direct sales and marketing efforts and initiatives, and creating alternate sales channels, will enable us to be a presence in our markets and help to reduce the costs of maintaining a nationwide sales and distribution network.  We normally enter into contracts directly with end users of our DispatchPlus communications solutions, including those introduced to us through our indirect dealer network. 
 To date, sales of our DispatchPlus service have been slower to ramp-up than our initial expectations for a number of reasons, including but not limited to, the performance of our indirect third-party sales representatives, longer initial sales cycles, and coverage gaps in certain markets due to delays in our deployment of planned sites.  We continue to develop and implement sales and marketing programs for our DispatchPlus service to drive increased customer acquisition and revenue growth.  Our progress in the growth of our sales funnel and positive customer feedback provide us with optimism about our future sales opportunities.  We are currently focusing our resources in the markets where we have commenced service.  That focus includes trialing and implementing a number of sales and marketing initiatives and strategies aimed at increasing sales of our DispatchPlus service and continuing to develop and grow a predictable sales funnel and process.  These initiatives include:

· | Identifying and targeting high-value, business customers that we believe will benefit from our DispatchPlus service;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Focusing our advertising and marketing efforts to more clearly communicate the benefits of our services to business customers in our targeted market verticals;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Developing and bringing to market innovative features that continue to differentiate us from other wireless communications service providers that provide PTT solutions;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Providing additional incentive programs, both to our third-party sales representatives and to our customer prospects;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Building and trialing a business development direct sales team in one of our seven markets and adding limited direct sales resources in the other markets;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Orienting our sales and marketing organizational structure to track the distinct channels of distribution we are employing in our market areas and to bring added focus to the different types of potential customer accounts and related sales and marketing processes;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Developing a centralized business development and telesales team to increase the flow of qualified leads and sales across all of our market areas; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Developing alternate third-party sales channel strategies and identifying new sources of sales and leads in our targeted market verticals.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We intend to continue to focus our efforts on the initial seven markets where we have commenced service until we prove out our DispatchPlus business model in those markets.  We have prepared for the potential future rollout of our DispatchPlus service in more than thirteen additional markets by completing initial network designs and, in some markets performing additional site development activity.  We believe this approach will allow us to more quickly and effectively proceed with new market deployments when we determine it is best to do so.  We also believe this approach will provide us with additional time and financial flexibility to refine our longer-term strategies, including those related to our Joint Petition.
 Our Competition 
 The market for network and mobile communication solutions for enterprises has been and will continue to be characterized by intense competition on the basis of price, performance, technology advances and the features, functionality, quality and reliability of the offered services and products.  With respect to our DispatchPlus business, we compete with the wireless Tier 1 carriers.  Most of these competitors offer some form of PTT service, along with a selection of mobile resource management solutions.  In addition to the Tier 1 carriers, our DispatchPlus business also competes with local SMR and other dispatch service providers who offer PTT services to our targeted dispatch-centric business market verticals.  With respect to our broadband and other spectrum initiatives, we compete with the Tier 1 carriers, local SMR operators and other public and private companies that are in the business of acquiring and developing spectrum assets.  In addition, our Joint Petition is opposed by certain incumbents and other third parties with conflicting business interests.  Many of the third parties who offer communication solutions for enterprises or with whom we compete for spectrum opportunities have more resources, longer operating histories, larger sales and marketing teams and greater political and regulatory influence than we do. Our Significant Business Relationships
 Sprint. In May 2014, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of Sprint (the “Sprint APA”) to acquire: (i) FCC licenses to operate a nationwide dispatch network in the 900 MHz band and (ii) certain 900 MHz equipment. We paid Sprint an aggregate of $100 million for these assets, consisting of $90 million in cash and $10 million in shares of our common stock at a price equal to $20.00 per share. In September 2014, we obtained the necessary approvals from the FCC to transfer the FCC licenses from Sprint to us, and we then completed the closing of the purchase and sales of the spectrum assets.
 Motorola. We signed a reseller agreement with Motorola pursuant to which we agreed to purchase, and Motorola agreed to supply us with, the Motorola digital technology we are utilizing to deploy our PTT network and the mobile handsets and devices we are offering to our customers on that network.  Additionally, Motorola invested $10 million in our subsidiary, PDV Spectrum Holding Company, LLC, that we formed to hold our 900 MHz spectrum licenses.  Motorola’s ownership interest in our subsidiary is convertible, at the option of either Motorola or us, into shares of our common stock at a price equal to $20.00 per share. Motorola is not entitled to any profits, dividends or other distribution from the operations of our subsidiary. 
 In addition, we entered into a lease agreement with Motorola pursuant to in which our subsidiary agreed to lease a portion of our 900 MHz licenses in exchange for an upfront, fully-paid lease fee of $7.5 million. Under the terms of this lease agreement with Motorola, Motorola can use the leased channels to provide narrowband services to certain qualified end-users. The end-users can only use the leased channels for their own internal communication purposes. The end-users cannot sublease the channels to any other end-users or to any commercial radio system operations or carriers. The lease agreement specifically states that the channels leased to Motorola will not be used in a manner that would be competitive with our services and limits the total number of channels that Motorola can lease in any market area. The lease agreement provides us with flexibility regarding the future use and management of our spectrum, including setting forth relocation and repurposing policies for or affecting the leased channels, which policies are designed to facilitate any necessary re-alignment of frequencies that may be associated with our efforts to assemble contiguous spectrum for broadband uses. 


 
 Page 7

 
     Motorola cannot enter contracts with end-users after December 31, 2020 involving new leases of spectrum from us without our consent and the payment of an additional fee. The initial lease period for any end-user cannot last more than seven years, and the lease can only be renewed for up to three years for an aggregate lease period of up to 10 years.  In addition, we agreed to purchase equipment manufactured by Motorola for any future broadband network we deploy, provided that Motorola makes reasonable efforts to ensure the equipment meets our required sourcing criteria.  Our Intellectual Property
 To establish and protect our proprietary technologies and service offerings, we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade-secret laws, as well as confidentiality provisions in our contracts. We have implemented a patent strategy designed to protect our pdvConnect and DispatchPlus technologies and facilitate the commercialization of our service offerings. Currently, our patent portfolio is comprised of seven issued U.S. patents, two issued European patents and two issued Canadian patents, all of which have been assigned to and are owned by us. In addition, we have several trademarks and service marks to protect our corporate name, services offerings, goodwill and brand. There are currently no claims or litigation regarding these trademarks, patents, copyrights, or service marks. We also rely on trade-secret protection of our intellectual property. We enter into confidentiality agreements with third parties, employees and consultants when appropriate.  The Regulation of Our Business
 The FCC regulates the licensing, construction, operation and acquisition of our wireless operations and wireless spectrum holdings in the United States.  We hold FCC spectrum licenses in the 900 MHz band as a non-interconnected, non-common carrier SMR service provider.  As such, within the limitations of our spectrum holdings and available technology, we are authorized by the FCC to provide non-interconnected mobile communications services, including two-way radio dispatch, and mobile data and internet services.  
 Licensing. We are entitled to provide our wireless communication services on specified spectrum frequencies within specified geographic areas and in doing so must comply with the rules, regulations and policies adopted by the FCC. The FCC issues each spectrum license for a fixed period of time, typically 10 years in the case of the FCC licenses we currently hold. While the FCC has generally renewed licenses held by operating companies like us, the FCC has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if it determines that a license renewal is not in the public interest. Furthermore, we could be subject to fines, forfeitures and other penalties for failure to comply with FCC regulations, even if any such non-compliance is unintentional. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and FCC rules and regulations require us to obtain the FCC’s prior approval before assigning or transferring control of wireless licenses, with limited exceptions.  The FCC’s rules and regulations also govern spectrum lease arrangements for a range of wireless radio service licenses, including the licenses we hold. These same requirements apply to any licenses or leases we may wish to acquire as part of our broadband initiatives.  The FCC may prohibit or impose conditions on any proposed acquisitions, sales or other transfers of control of licenses or leases. The FCC engages in a case-by-case review of transactions that involve the consolidation or sale of spectrum licenses or leases and may apply a spectrum “screen” in examining such transactions. Because an FCC license is necessary to lawfully provide the wireless services we currently offer and plan to offer, if the FCC were to disapprove any such request to acquire, assign or otherwise transfer a license or lease, our business plans would be adversely affected. Approval from the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, as well as state or local regulatory authorities, also may be required if we sell or acquire spectrum. 
 900 MHz Band Spectrum Reconfiguration. FCC approval will be required to allow repurposing of 900 MHz spectrum from narrowband to broadband and to allow the realignment of the 900 MHz spectrum so that it is capable of supporting the LTE technology consistent with our long-range broadband initiatives. A decision by the FCC declining to permit the needed spectrum repurposing and subsequent realignment activities could have a significant adverse effect on the value of our spectrum and on our future plans for provision of broadband services. 
 FCC Regulations. The FCC does not currently regulate rates for services offered by wireless providers.  However, we may be subject to other FCC regulations that impose obligations on wireless providers, such as federal Universal Service Fund obligations, which require communications providers to contribute to a fund that supports subsidized communications services to underserved areas and users; rules governing billing, subscriber privacy and customer proprietary network information; roaming obligations; rules that require wireless service providers to configure their networks to facilitate electronic surveillance by law enforcement officials; rules governing spam, telemarketing and truth-in-billing; and rules requiring us to offer equipment and services that are accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities, among others. There are also pending proceedings that may affect spectrum aggregation limits and/or adjustment of the FCC’s case-by-case spectrum screens; regulation surrounding the deployment of advanced wireless broadband infrastructure; the imposition of text-to-911 capabilities; and the transition to IP networks, among others. Some of these requirements and pending proceedings (of which the foregoing examples are not an exhaustive list) pose technical and operational challenges to which we, and the industry as a whole, have not yet developed clear solutions. We are unable to predict how these pending or future FCC proceedings may affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our failure to comply with any applicable FCC regulations could subject us to significant fines or forfeitures.

     State and Local Regulation. In addition to FCC regulation, we are subject to certain state regulatory requirements. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, preempts state and local regulation of the entry of, or the rates charged by, any wireless provider. State and local governments are permitted to manage public rights of way and can require fair and reasonable compensation from wireless providers for use of those rights of way so long as the compensation required is publicly disclosed by the government. The siting of base stations also remains subject to some degree of control by state and local jurisdiction. States also may impose competitively neutral requirements that, among other things, are necessary for universal service or to defray the costs of state E911 services programs, to protect the public safety and welfare, and to safeguard the rights of customers. 
 Tower Siting. Although we currently lease tower space from third parties in connection with deploying and operating our PTT network, if, in the future, we chose to deploy broadband facilities on tower facilities that we build or operate, we will be required to comply with various federal, state and local regulations that govern the siting, lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennas, including requirements imposed by the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Federal rules subject certain tower site locations to extensive zoning, environmental and historic preservation requirements and mandate consultation with various parties, including State and Tribal Historic Preservation Offices, which can make it more difficult and expensive to deploy facilities. The FCC antenna structure registration process also imposes public notice requirements when plans are made for construction of, or modification to, antenna structures that require FAA approval, potentially adding to the delays and burdens associated with tower siting, including potential challenges from special interest groups. To the extent governmental agencies continue to impose additional requirements like this on the tower siting process, the time and cost to construct towers could be negatively impacted. The FCC has, however, imposed a tower siting “shot clock” that requires local authorities to address tower applications within a specific timeframe, which can assist carriers in more rapid deployment of towers.  More recently, the FCC also has initiated proceedings in which it is examining means to accelerate broadband deployment by removing barriers to infrastructure investment. 
 Motor Vehicle Restrictions. A number of states and localities have banned or are considering banning or restricting the use of wireless handsets and devices while driving a motor vehicle, which in many instances could include the use of PTT devices. Such bans could cause a decline in the number of minutes of use by business customers or make our service less attractive to certain potential subscribers. 
 Electronic Surveillance. We may be required by law to provide certain surveillance capabilities to law enforcement agencies. If required, we intend to deliver the requisite surveillance capabilities to law enforcement with respect to our PTT service. 
 National Security. National security and disaster recovery issues continue to receive attention at the federal, state and local levels. For example, Congress is expected to again consider cyber security legislation to increase the security and resiliency of the nation’s digital infrastructure. In 2013, the President issued an executive order directing the Department of Homeland Security and other government agencies to take a number of steps to improve the security of the nation’s critical infrastructure. The details surrounding the implementation of this order have not been resolved, however, and we cannot predict the cost or other impacts of such measures. Moreover, the FCC continues to examine issues of network resiliency and reliability and may seek to impose additional regulations designed to reduce the severity and length of disruptions in communications.
