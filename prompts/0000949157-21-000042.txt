Item 1.  Business
Overview
Century Aluminum Company is a global producer of primary aluminum and operates aluminum reduction facilities, or "smelters," in the United States and Iceland.  Aluminum is an internationally traded commodity, and its price is effectively determined on the London Metal Exchange (the "LME"), plus applicable regional and product premiums. Our primary aluminum reduction facilities produce standard-grade and value-added primary aluminum products.  Our current annual production capacity is approximately 1,016,000 tonnes per year ("tpy"). We produced approximately 794,000 tonnes of primary aluminum in 2020.
In addition to our primary aluminum assets, we own a carbon anode production facility located in the Netherlands ("Vlissingen"). Carbon anodes are consumed in the production of primary aluminum. Vlissingen supplies carbon anodes to our aluminum smelter in Grundartangi, Iceland. Each of our aluminum smelters in the United States produces anodes at on-site facilities.
We operate our business through one reportable segment, primary aluminum. Additional information about our segment reporting and certain geographic information is available in Note 18. Business Segments to the consolidated financial statements included herein.
Century Aluminum Company is a Delaware corporation with our principal executive offices located at One South Wacker Drive, Suite 1000, Chicago, Illinois 60606.
Strategic Objective
Our strategic objective is to serve our various constituencies (which, importantly, includes the creation of long-term value for our stockholders) by: (a) optimizing our safety and environmental performance; (b) improving the competitiveness of our existing assets by managing costs and improving productivity and efficiency; (c) pursuing upstream investment opportunities; and (d) expanding our primary aluminum business by improving and investing in the facilities we currently own as well as constructing, investing in or acquiring additional production capacity. 
Primary Aluminum Facilities
Overview of Facilities
We operate three U.S. aluminum smelters, in Hawesville, Kentucky ("Hawesville"), Robards, Kentucky ("Sebree") and Goose Creek, South Carolina ("Mt. Holly"), and one aluminum smelter in Grundartangi, Iceland ("Grundartangi"). 
Grundartangi
The Grundartangi facility, located in Grundartangi, Iceland, is a primary aluminum reduction facility owned and operated by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Nordural Grundartangi ehf, and is our most modern facility. Grundartangi is currently in the process of a multi-year expansion project that has brought the annual primary aluminum production capacity to current capacity of approximately 317,000 tonnes and is expected to ultimately increase annual production capacity at Grundartangi to approximately 325,000 tonnes. Grundartangi produces standard-grade aluminum ingot and a primary foundry alloy product, which is a value-added product that is sold at a premium to standard-grade aluminum. 
Hawesville
Hawesville, located adjacent to the Ohio River near Hawesville, Kentucky, is a primary aluminum reduction facility owned and operated by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Century Kentucky, Inc. ("CAKY"). Hawesville has an annual production capacity of approximately 250,000 tonnes of primary aluminum.
Approximately 60% of Hawesville's capacity was curtailed in the fourth quarter of 2015 as a result of significant declines in the LME price for aluminum. We are currently in the process of a multi-year project at Hawesville to restart this previously curtailed capacity, rebuild the two potlines that we continued to operate past their expected life cycle, and implement new technology across all production. In early 2019, we completed the first phase of this project, which involved restarting production on the three potlines that had been curtailed since 2015. The second phase of the project involves rebuilding the two potlines that had continued to operate past their expected life cycle and the implementation of certain new technology across all production. These two potlines were taken out of production in February and September 2019, respectively. The rebuild of the first of these potlines was completed in the second quarter of 2020. With the restart of this potline, the Hawesville smelter is currently operating at approximately 80% production capacity. The rebuild of the fifth and final potline and the completion of the technology upgrades are expected to be completed over the next several years subject to market conditions.
Hawesville produces standard-grade and high purity aluminum that can be cast into sow or delivered directly to nearby customers as molten metal. 
Hawesville is our largest U.S. smelter and is the largest producer of high purity primary aluminum in North America. Four of Hawesville's five potlines are capable of producing high purity aluminum which is sold at a premium to standard-grade aluminum and is used extensively by the defense industry as well as for aerospace and other applications.  
Sebree
Sebree, located adjacent to the Green River near Robards, Kentucky, is a primary aluminum reduction facility owned and operated by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Century Aluminum Sebree LLC ("Century Sebree"). Sebree has an annual production capacity of approximately 220,000 tonnes of primary aluminum. Sebree produces standard-grade aluminum that can be cast into sow and value-added products, including billet, that are sold at a premium to standard-grade aluminum or delivered directly to nearby customers as molten metal. In 2019, we expanded the smelter’s overall output by adding 20,000 tonnes of additional secondary (scrap reprocessing) capacity.
Mt. Holly
Mt. Holly, located in Goose Creek, South Carolina, is a primary aluminum reduction facility owned and operated by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Century Aluminum of South Carolina, Inc. ("CASC"). Mt. Holly has an annual production capacity of approximately 229,000 tonnes of primary aluminum. The Mt. Holly facility is currently operating at approximately 50% of its production capacity while CASC finalizes a new, three-year power agreement with South Carolina Public Service Authority (also known as Santee Cooper), which is expected to be effective April 1, 2021. The new contract with Santee Cooper is expected to provide sufficient energy to allow the smelter to increase its production to 75% of Mt. Holly's full production capacity. See "Key Production Costs — Electrical Power Supply Agreements" below for further discussion of our power arrangements at Mt. Holly.
Mt. Holly produces standard-grade aluminum that is cast into tee bars as well as several value-added products, including billet and foundry products. These value-added primary aluminum products are sold at a premium to standard-grade aluminum. 
Primary Aluminum Production Capacity
Our primary aluminum smelters and their respective primary aluminum capacities are shown in the following table: 

Facility | Ownership Percentage | Operational | Annual Production Capacity (tpy) (1) | Actual 2020 Annual Production (tpy) 
Grundartangi, Iceland | 100% | 1998 | 317,000 | 313,000 
Hawesville, Kentucky, USA | 100% | 1970 | 250,000 | 170,000 
Sebree, Kentucky, USA | 100% | 1973 | 220,000 | 204,000 
Mt. Holly, South Carolina, USA | 100% | 1980 | 229,000 | 107,000 
 | | | 1,016,000 | 794,000 

(1)The tonnes per year (tpy) figures in this column reflect an estimate of the facility's total production capacity based on plant design, historical operating results and operating efficiencies and does not necessarily represent each facility’s maximum production capability.
Primary Aluminum Shipment Volume
The following table shows our primary aluminum shipment volumes since 2016.
Carbon Products Facilities
Vlissingen    
In addition to our primary aluminum assets, we own a carbon anode production facility located in Vlissingen, the Netherlands, which is owned and operated by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Century Aluminum Vlissingen B.V. Vlissingen has an annual carbon anode production capacity of approximately 163,000 tonnes. We acquired Vlissingen in 2012 and restarted the facility in late 2013 with an initial carbon anode production capacity of 75,000 tonnes. Since the acquisition, we have completed a variety of expansion projects and efficiency programs in order to more than double the plant's production capacity. With these expansion projects and efficiency programs in place, we expect Vlissingen will be able to supply approximately 93% to 98% of Grundartangi’s carbon anodes requirements at current production levels. Each of our smelters in the United States produces anodes at on-site facilities.
Pricing
Pricing for primary aluminum products is typically comprised of three components: (i) the base commodity price which is based on quoted prices on the LME, plus (ii) any regional premium (e.g., the Midwest premium for metal sold in the United States and the European Duty Paid premium for metal sold into Europe) plus (iii) any product premium. Our operating results are highly sensitive to changes in the LME price of primary aluminum and the amount of regional premiums and product 
premiums.  As a result, from time to time, we assess the appropriateness of mitigating the effects of fluctuations in the aluminum price through the use of fixed-price commitments, LME-linked supply contracts and other financial instruments. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for further discussion of how we manage our exposure to market risk. 
Customer Base
We have historically derived substantially all of our consolidated net sales of primary aluminum from a small number of customers. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we derived approximately 64% of our consolidated sales from Glencore plc and its affiliates (together, "Glencore") and approximately 12% of our consolidated sales from Southwire Company ("Southwire"). We currently have agreements in place to sell a substantial portion of our 2021 production to these customers. We expect that the rest of our 2021 customer base will remain fairly concentrated among a small number of customers under short-term contracts.
Both Glencore and Southwire purchase aluminum produced at our U.S. smelters at prices based on the LME price for primary aluminum plus the Midwest premium plus any additional market-based product premiums. Glencore also purchases aluminum produced at our Grundartangi, Iceland smelter at prices based on the LME plus the European Duty Paid premium plus any additional market-based product premiums. Glencore beneficially owns 42.9% of our outstanding common stock (46.8% on a fully diluted basis). 
Key Production Costs
Alumina, electrical power, calcined petroleum coke and liquid pitch (the key raw materials for carbon anodes), and labor are the principal components of our cost of production.  These components together represented over 75% of our cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2020.  For a description of certain risks related to our raw materials, supplies, power and labor, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Alumina Supply Agreements
While Century may enter into other purchases of alumina as market conditions change, a summary of our principal alumina supply agreements is provided below: 

Supplier | Quantity | Term | Pricing (2) 
Concord Resources Ltd. | Approximately 180,000 tpy | Through December 2022 | LME-linked 
Concord Resources Ltd. | Approximately 600,000 tpy | Through December 2024 | Fixed, LME-linked, and API-linked components
Glencore(1) | Variable | Through December 2021 | LME-linked 

(1) Under the terms of this agreement, Glencore provides alumina supply for all of Century's requirements net of other contractual commitments.
(2) "API" refers to a published alumina price index
Electrical Power Supply Agreements
The table below summarizes our long-term power supply agreements:

Facility | | Supplier | Term | Pricing 
Grundartangi | | Landsvirkjun | Through 2023 - 2036 | Variable rate linked to (i) the LME price for primary aluminum or (ii) the Nord Pool power market
 | Orkuveita Reykjavíkur ("OR") | 
 | HS Orka hf ("HS") | 
Hawesville | | Kenergy Corporation ("Kenergy") | Through December 31, 2023 | Variable rate based on market prices 
Sebree | | Kenergy | Through December 31, 2023 | Variable rate based on market prices 
Mt. Holly | | South Carolina Public Service Authority ("Santee Cooper") | Through March 31, 2021 | Variable rate based in part on a cost of service charge and in part on natural gas prices 
Helguvik | | OR | Approximately 25 years from the dates of each phase of power delivery | Variable rate based on the LME price for primary aluminum 

Electrical power represents one of the largest components of our cost of goods sold. From time to time, we may enter into forward contracts or other hedging arrangements to mitigate our electrical power or natural gas price risk. The paragraphs below summarize the sources of power and the long-term power arrangements for each of our operations.
Grundartangi. Power is currently supplied to Grundartangi from hydroelectric and geothermal sources under long-term power purchase agreements with HS, Landsvirkjun and OR. Historically, all of the power supplied to Grundartangi has been delivered at prices indexed to the price of primary aluminum. Since November 2019, the price of approximately 30% of Grundartangi’s power requirements has been linked to the market price for power in the Nord Pool power market, the trading market for power in the Nordic countries and certain other areas of Europe. As of December 31, 2020, we had entered into financial contracts to fix the forward price of approximately 80% and 50% of Grundartangi's Nord Pool based power requirements for the years ending December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022, respectively. We may enter into further similar financial contracts in the future. 
Grundartangi's power purchase agreements expire on various dates from 2023 through 2036 (subject to extension). Each power purchase agreement contains take-or-pay obligations with respect to a significant percentage of the total committed and available power under such agreement. 
Hawesville. CAKY is party to a power supply arrangement with Kenergy and EDF Trading North America, LLC ("EDF") which provides market-based power to the Hawesville smelter. Under this arrangement, the power companies purchase power on the open market and pass it through to Hawesville at Midcontinent Independent System Operator ("MISO") pricing plus transmission and other costs. The power supply arrangement with Kenergy has an effective term through December 2023. The arrangement with EDF to act as our market participant with MISO has an effective term through May 2022. Both of these agreements extend automatically year to year thereafter unless a one year notice of termination is given by either party.
Sebree. Century Sebree is party to a power supply arrangement with Kenergy and EDF which provides market-based power to the Sebree smelter. Similar to the arrangement at Hawesville, the power companies purchase power on the open market and pass it through to Sebree at MISO pricing plus transmission and other costs. The power supply arrangement with Kenergy has an effective term through December 2023. The arrangement with EDF to act as our market participant with MISO has an effective term through May 2022. Both of these agreements extend automatically year to year thereafter unless a one year notice of termination is given by either party.
Mt. Holly. CASC is currently party to both a power agreement with a third-party supplier (providing 75% of Mt. Holly's power) and Santee Cooper (providing 25% of Mt. Holly's power) to supply the Mt. Holly smelter with all its power needs. Both of these power agreements were set to expire on December 31, 2020 but were extended through March 31, 2021 as we finalize a new, three-year power arrangement with Santee Cooper that is expected to be effective April 1, 2021. It is expected under the new power contract with Santee Cooper, 100% of Mt. Holly's electrical power requirements will be supplied from 
Santee Cooper's generation at cost of service based rates. The new contract with Santee Cooper is expected to provide sufficient energy to allow the smelter to increase its production to 75% of Mt. Holly's full production capacity. If we are unable to finalize this proposed new power contract with Santee Cooper and obtain all necessary government approvals, we may choose, or be forced, to further curtail operations at the plant. See Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Helguvik. Nordural Helguvik is party to a power agreement with OR for a portion of Helguvik’s expected power requirements to the Helguvik project. The agreement would provide power at LME-based variable rates and contain take-or-pay obligations with respect to a significant percentage of the total committed and available power under such agreement. The first stage of power under the OR power purchase agreement (approximately 47.5 megawatts ("MW")) became available in the fourth quarter of 2011 and is currently being utilized at Grundartangi. The agreement contains certain conditions to OR’s obligations with respect to the remaining phases and OR has alleged that certain of these conditions have not been satisfied. 
See Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information concerning our power arrangements. 
Employees and Human Capital Resources
We believe our employees are key to achieving our business goals and growth strategy. As of December 31, 2020, we had 2,078 employees. Of these, 1,392 were domiciled in the United States, 72 in the Netherlands and 614 in Iceland. 
Health, Safety and Wellness. Nothing is more important than the health and safety of our employees and the members of the communities in which we do business. We continuously assess the risks our employees face at our operations and we work to mitigate those risks through frequent training and other preventative safety and health programs. We strive for zero injuries and accidents, to foster systems and processes aimed to continuously improve our health and safety performance and to integrate risk management relating to health and safety into all aspects of our operations. We emphasize the importance of safety goals by including safety performance as one of the metrics for determining payouts under our annual incentive awards to our executives. The safety focus of the Company is evident in our approach to the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time, we have taken, and continue to take, measures to protect the health and safety of our employees during the pandemic, including requirements regarding wearing masks, social distancing, cleaning sanitation procedures, and temperature checks. We have also developed and implemented protocols across our operations to address actual and suspected COVID-19 cases and potential exposure of our employees. 
Compensation and Benefits. The Company's non-union employees are all eligible to participate in the Company paid health, vision, dental, life, prescription and long-term disability insurance plans. The Company also provides employees with paid supplemental life and accident insurance plan. The Company offers employees the opportunity to contribute to a Flexible Spending Account and a Health Savings Account. The Company also offers employees a 401(k) retirement plan with a Company match. As part of our Century Well-being program, and in an effort to encourage employees to participate, Century provides financial incentives to its employees who choose to participate. We also have recently taken steps to strengthen our Century Well-being program and to build a program that is specifically designed for Century employees and the unique health issues they may encounter. At the end of 2020 and beginning of 2021, we have begun efforts to roll out new health benefits at no cost to our employees centered around diabetes management, mental health and substance abuse and counseling, and musculoskeletal conditions. 
Diversity and Inclusion. The Company is committed to promoting equal employment opportunity in all of our operations. It is the Company’s policy, specifically noted in the Company’s Code of Ethics, that we do not tolerate discrimination in any form on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, national origin, disability, veteran status or genetic information as defined in the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008, whether or not such discrimination violates law, and to comply fully with all laws prohibiting discrimination and promoting opportunity and advancement in employment. This policy extends to all aspects of employment opportunity including recruitment, hiring, compensation, benefits, promotion, transfer, layoff, recall, reduction in force, termination, retirement, placement, training and all other privileges, terms and conditions of employment.
Talent Development. Recently, we have made significant progress in enhancing our internal performance management and talent management systems in an effort to continue to recognize and promote outstanding employees. We have worked to streamline the process for our employees and ensure that we provide employees with the opportunity to provide input as part of the review process.
 Labor Agreements 
The bargaining unit employees at our Grundartangi, Vlissingen, Hawesville and Sebree facilities are represented by labor unions, representing 67% of our total workforce.  Our employees at Mt. Holly are not represented by a labor union.
A summary of our key labor agreements is provided below:

Facility | Organization | Term 
Grundartangi | Icelandic labor unions | Through December 31, 2024
Hawesville | United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union (“USW”) | Through April 1, 2021 
Sebree | USW | Through October 28, 2023 
Vlissingen | Federation for the Metal and Electrical Industry (“FME”) | Through December 1, 2020 

Approximately 86% of Grundartangi’s workforce is represented by five labor unions, governed by a labor agreement that establishes wages and work rules for covered employees. The current agreement is effective through December 31, 2024.
100% of Vlissingen’s workforce is represented by FME as Vlissingen is a member of the FME, a Netherlands' employers' organization for companies in the metal, electronics, electrical engineering and plastic sectors. The FME negotiates working conditions with trade unions on behalf of its members, which, when agreed upon, are then applicable to all employees of Vlissingen. The current labor agreement expired on December 1, 2020 and since such time we have been operating under the terms of the expired agreement while we engage in negotiations regarding the terms of a new labor agreement.
Approximately 58% of our U.S. based workforce is represented by the USW. CAKY's Hawesville employees represented by the USW are under a collective bargaining agreement that expires on April 1, 2021. Century Sebree's employees represented by USW are under a collective bargaining agreement that expires on October 28, 2023. 
Competition
The market for primary aluminum is global, and demand for aluminum varies widely from region to region.  We compete with aluminum producers within the U.S. and internationally as well as with producers of alternative materials such as steel, copper, carbon fiber, composites, plastic and glass, each of which may be substituted for aluminum in certain applications. Our competitive position depends, in part, on the availability of electricity, alumina and our other key raw materials to our operations at competitive prices. We face global competition from companies who may have access to these key production costs at lower prices. Many of our competitors are also larger than we are and have vertically integrated operations with superior cost positions. As a result, these companies may be better able to withstand reductions in price or other adverse industry or economic conditions.
Competitive Advantages 
While we face significant competition, we also have several competitive advantages. We believe our key competitive advantages are:
Focus on Primary Aluminum Business. We operate principally in the production of primary aluminum. By concentrating our activities in primary aluminum production, we are able to focus our resources on optimizing the cost effectiveness of our existing operations, minimizing overhead costs and maintaining a market position where our products are ultimately targeted toward a broad range of end uses.
Strong Internal Growth Opportunities. Over the past several years, we have undertaken various expansion programs at all of our operating facilities and continue to pursue additional internal growth opportunities. We are currently in the process of a multi-year project at Hawesville to restart previously curtailed capacity, rebuild two potlines that we had continued to operate past their expected life cycle, and implement new technology across all production. Through December 31, 2020, we have rebuilt or restarted 200,000 tonnes of production (Hawesville's current production capacity) and can restart another 50,000 tonnes of production capacity in the future. At Sebree, in 2019, we expanded the smelter’s overall output by adding 20,000 tonnes of additional secondary (scrap reprocessing) capacity. At Mt. Holly, the new power 
contract with Santee Cooper is expected to provide sufficient energy to allow the smelter to increase its production to 75% of Mt. Holly's full production capacity.
At our Grundartangi, Iceland smelter, we are in the process of a multi-year project that has brought Grundartangi's annual primary aluminum production capacity to current capacity of approximately 317,000 tonnes of primary aluminum and is expected to ultimately increase annual production capacity to approximately 325,000 tonnes. At Vlissingen, we have completed a variety of expansion projects and efficiency programs in order to more than double the plant's production capacity. With these expansion projects and efficiency programs in place, we expect Vlissingen to be able to supply approximately 93% to 98% of Grundartangi’s carbon anode requirements at current production levels. 
We continue to pursue additional internal growth opportunities to maximize efficiencies and improve overall performance.
 Duty Free Access to our Major Customer Markets. Our facilities benefit from international and national trade laws and regulations. For example, the European Union imposes import tariffs on primary aluminum from producers outside the European Economic Area (the "EEA"), which includes Iceland, and the U.S. currently imposes a 10% tariff on certain primary aluminum imports into the United States. Our U.S. and Icelandic businesses currently access these respective markets duty-free which provides us with an advantage over our competitors who sell into these markets under these tariff regimes.
 Close Proximity to our Major Customers. Our U.S. facilities benefit from the proximity to our U.S. customer base, allowing us to capture the Midwest premium and providing a competitive advantage in freight costs over our competitors. The proximity to our customers also allows us to deliver a portion of our Kentucky production in molten form, saving casting costs, and providing a competitive advantage over other potential suppliers. In Iceland, our proximity to European markets provides a competitive advantage for Grundartangi, allowing us to capture the European Duty Paid Premium and other logistical benefits compared to our competitors outside the EEA. 
 Access to Market Power. Our Kentucky operations benefit from market-based power contracts that provide electricity to these operations at competitive prices. Since November 2019, the price of approximately 30% of Grundartangi’s power requirements has been linked to the market price for power in the Nord Pool power market, the trading market for power in the Nordic countries and certain areas of Europe. Approximately 70% of the power requirements for our Grundartangi plant is indexed to the price of primary aluminum, which reduces our exposure to power price fluctuations and provides a natural hedge against movements in the aluminum price. 
 Diverse Value Added Product and Secondary Market Portfolio. We have the ability across our operations to cast a variety of aluminum products, both in terms of shapes and alloys. These high purity and value-added primary aluminum products are sold at a premium to standard-grade aluminum. Our Hawesville plant is the largest producer of high purity aluminum in North America. Four of Hawesville’s five potlines are capable of producing high purity aluminum, which is used extensively by the defense industry as well as for certain aerospace applications. Both Sebree and Mt. Holly have value-added casthouses that have the ability to produce large volumes of billet, slab and other value-added products. 
 Sustainability. Our Natur-Al™ aluminum produced at our Grundartangi, Iceland smelter has one of the lowest carbon footprints in the industry due to Grundartangi’s access to clean hydroelectric and geothermal power sources. Our Grundartangi smelter has also been certified against the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI) Performance Standard for responsible production, sourcing and stewardship of aluminum. In addition to providing additional value to our customers, our low carbon footprint in Iceland mitigates our exposure to current or future carbon regulations. 
 Experienced Management Team. Our management team includes executives and managers with significant experience in the aluminum industry, the broader metals and mining sector, the development of large and complex projects and the functional disciplines we require to manage and grow our business. In addition, the managers of our production facilities have substantial backgrounds and expertise in the technical and operational aspects of these plants.
For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. We may be unable to continue to compete successfully in the highly competitive markets in which we operate.
Government Regulations 
Our facilities and operations are subject to various laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate, including, but not limited to, environmental laws and regulations.  We have spent, and expect to continue to spend, significant amounts for compliance with those various laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations.  In addition, some of our past manufacturing activities or those of our predecessors have resulted in environmental consequences that require remedial measures.  Under certain environmental laws, which may impose liability regardless of fault, we may be liable for the costs of remediation of contaminated property, including our current and formerly owned or operated properties or adjacent areas, or for the amelioration of damage to natural resources. We believe, based on currently available information, that compliance with existing laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings and our competitive position. Furthermore, we believe, based on currently available information, that our current liabilities are not likely to have a material adverse effect on Century. However, we cannot predict the requirements of future laws and future requirements at current or formerly owned or operated properties or adjacent areas or the outcome of certain existing litigation to which we are a party.  Such future requirements or events may result in unanticipated costs or liabilities that may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  More information concerning our contingencies can be found in Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included herein.
Intellectual Property
We own or have rights to use a number of intellectual property rights relating to various aspects of our operations. We do not consider our business to be materially dependent on any of these intellectual property rights.
