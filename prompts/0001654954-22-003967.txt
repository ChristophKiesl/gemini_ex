ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview

Charge Enterprises, Inc. (the “Company” or “Charge”) consists of a portfolio of global businesses with a vision to build the electrification and telecommunications infrastructure that will address and service requirements for EVC and WNI which includes 5G, tower, distributed antennae systems (“DAS”), small cell, and electrical infrastructure.  We operate in two segments: Telecommunications which provides connection of voice calls and data to global carriers and Infrastructure which builds physical wireless network elements, provides electrical construction services and designs and installs EV charging stations and infrastructure. 
Strategy

Our strategy is to maintain the solid business within Telecommunication and to drive growth within Infrastructure by leveraging our operating subsidiaries and developing strategic relationships. Within Infrastructure, we provide seamless solutions for the physical elements of wireless networks and installation, monitoring and maintenance of EV charging stations. Infrastructure’s goal is to implement end-to-end solutions for customers that are custom designed to enhance connectivity, productivity, reduce the cost of operations, decrease greenhouse emissions, and improve the efficiency of commercial operations for our customers and their consumers. 

We believe the rise of new developing technologies in both the wireless network and EVC industries offers us a unique growth opportunity.  Our strategy focuses on continued development and organic growth as well as targeted acquisitions and strategic alliances.  We intend to do this through the following: 

Leveraging existing private and public sector relationships to organically grow WNI and EVC installations: Within the WNI and EVC space, we have built solid relationships with automotive dealerships, commercial fleets, major carriers, general, electrical and sub-contractors, private industry and governmental organizations allowing us to grow the number of projects and revenues. As an agnostic hardware and software player in the WNI and EVC market, we tailor installations to the requirements of each industry segment, creating customized charging solutions and affording Charge a significant competitive advantage over competitors. In the future, we plan to target businesses such as parking structures, apartment and office complexes, gas stations, shopping centers, big box retail and hotel chains. 

Expand reach and capacity across North America through organic growth and strategic M&A:  We continue to leverage our relationships within multiple verticals, original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), commercial fleets, vendors, real estate, insurance and warranty, wireless and electric infrastructure to target acquisitions that expand scale and installation capacity, capabilities, channel distribution, and geographic reach within infrastructure implementation for WNI and EVC.  In May 2021, we acquired Nextridge, Inc., a New York corporation (“Nextridge”) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Advanced Network Solutions (collectively referred to as “ANS”), which has contributed to growth and strategic business opportunities.  ANS is highly experienced in the installation of physical wireless network elements including 5G, tower, DAS, small cells and will directly contribute to our goals of growing our footprint within this space.   In December 2021, we acquired B W Electrical Services, LLC (“BW”), a New Jersey limited liability company, which has added to our electrical construction expertise and access to the unionized labor market.  BW’s deep experience and unionized workforce will help position us for growth that we see coming in the years ahead within the infrastructure space.

Expand technology-enabled solutions: We continue to research and develop mobile application opportunities and tech enabled services designed to expand a seamless offering that assists employees, contractors and customers with a fluid experience throughout EVC and WNI. This suite of technology will complement and add to our existing proprietary software and apps that will support our custom infrastructure solutions to move and connect people.

Telecommunications 

Telecommunications, through our operating subsidiary PTGI International Carrier Services, Inc. (“PTGI”), provides connection of both voice and data to Carriers and Mobile Network Operators (“MNO’s”) globally for over two decades and we will selectively add profitable products and services, such as SMS text, to this long-established business. Telecommunications has contractual relationships with service providers in over 19 foreign countries primarily within Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and North America. We provide customers with internet-protocol-based and time-division multiplexing (“TDM”) access for the transport of long-distance voice and data minutes.

We operate a global telecommunications network consisting of domestic switching and related peripheral equipment, carrier-grade routers and switches for internet and circuit-based services. To ensure high-quality communications services, our network employs digital switching and fiber optic technologies, incorporates the use of voice-over-internet protocols, SS7/C7 signaling and is supported by comprehensive network monitoring and technical support services.

Foreign Carrier Agreements

In select countries where competition with traditional post telegraph and telecommunications companies (“PTTs”) are limited, we have entered into foreign carrier agreements with other PTTs, or similar service providers to provide traffic into these countries and receive such countries’ traffic in return. We maintain relations with approximately 200 wholesale carriers, or similar providers, all of which are at will arrangements.
Network Management and Control

Telecommunications owns and operates network management systems in Ashburn, Virginia to monitor and control our switching systems, global data network, and other digital transmission equipment. Additional network monitoring, network management, and traffic management services are supported from our network management centers located in Guatemala City, Guatemala and Bucharest, Romania. The network management control centers provide 24/7 online service.
Competition

Long Distance: We face significant competition as we attempt to expand our business from other telecommunications carriers and resellers. We compete on the basis of price, service quality, financial strength, relationship and presence. Sales of wholesale long-distance voice minutes are generated by connecting one telecommunications operator to another and charging a fee to do so.

Over-the- top (“OTT”) Applications: OTT Applications, such as WhatsApp, Skype, and FaceTime, continue to impact our long distance business model. There can be no assurance that the current declines in the long distance business globally driven by these applications will not increase; or that our business will not be impacted by the increased consumer adoption of such applications globally.

Government Regulation

We are subject to varying degrees of regulation in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Local laws and regulations, and the interpretation of such laws and regulations, differ among those jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that future regulatory, judicial and legislative changes or activities will not have a material adverse effect on us, or domestic or international regulators or third parties will not raise material issues with regard to our regulatory compliance. 

Regulation impacting the telecommunications industry continues to change rapidly in many jurisdictions. Privacy related laws and regulations, such as the EU’s GDPR, USA’s TRACED Act and associated caller identification authentication and fraudulent robocall mitigation rules, as well as privatization, deregulation, changes in regulation, consolidation, and technological change have had, and will continue to have, significant effects on the industry. Although we believe that deregulation with respect to portions of the telecommunications industry will continue and create opportunities for firms such as us, there can be no assurance that deregulation will continue, or if any regulatory changes implemented would benefit us.

As of December 31, 2021, we have implemented the following regulatory framework in our operating services offered: 

United States

In the United States, our Telecommunications division services are subject to the provisions of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”), and other federal laws, rules, and orders of the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) regulations, and the applicable laws and regulations of the various states. 
International Service Regulation 

The FCC has jurisdiction over common carrier services linking points in the U.S. to points in other countries and we provide such services. Providers of such international common carrier services must obtain authority from the FCC under Section 214 of the Communications Act. We have obtained the authorizations required to use, on a facilities-based and resale basis, various transmission media for the provision of international switched services and international private line services on a non-dominant carrier basis. The FCC is considering a number of possible changes to its rules governing international common carriers. We cannot predict how the FCC will resolve those issues or how its decisions will affect our international business. FCC rules permit non-dominant carriers such as ourselves to offer some services on a de-tariffed basis, to compete to provide consumers with lower rates and choices among carriers and services. 

In furtherance of its existing caller identification and fraudulent robocall mitigation rules, the FCC has proposed additional regulations for carriers delivering foreign-based call traffic to points in the U.S., including proposals that, if adopted, would require carriers such as us to apply the FCC’s STIR/SHAKEN caller identification authentication framework to foreign-originated calls with U.S. numbers and to implement robocall mitigation practices for such calls, including requirements to respond to traceback requests within 24 hours, implement mandatory call blocking based on existing FCC rules for US-originated calls, and implement know-your-customer policies. We already comply with all existing caller identification authentication and robocall mitigation rules applicable to our call traffic, and we will comply with any new rules adopted by the FCC that apply to our call traffic.

Domestic Service Regulation 

With respect to our domestic communications services, PTGi is considered a non-dominant interstate carrier subject to regulation by the FCC. FCC rules provide us significant authority to initiate or expand our domestic interstate operations, but we are required to obtain FCC approval to assume control of another telecommunications carrier or its assets, to transfer control of our operations to another entity, or to discontinue service. We are also required to file various reports and pay various fees and assessments to the FCC and various state commissions. Among other things, interstate common carriers must offer service on a nondiscriminatory basis at just and reasonable rates. The FCC has jurisdiction to hear complaints regarding our compliance or non-compliance with these and other requirements of the Communications Act and the FCC’s rules. Among other regulations, we are subject to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (“CALEA”) and associated FCC regulations which require telecommunications carriers to configure their networks to facilitate law enforcement authorities to perform electronic surveillance. 

FCC rules also require certain providers of retail long distance voice service to generate and retain various records regarding completion of calls to rural areas. Specifically, the rules require those providers to collect and retain information on long-distance call attempts such as, but not limited to, the called number, the date and time of the call, and the use of an intermediate provider. The rules also prohibit false audible ringing (the premature triggering of audible ring tones to the caller before the call setup request has reached the terminating service provider). While we are not directly subject to these rules, we may function as an intermediate provider within the meaning of these rules, which may require us to provide information to our customers regarding calls that we carry on their behalf. In addition, under Section 262 to the Communications Act of 1934, intermediate providers, such as ourselves must register with the FCC and meet certain quality standards (now embodied in the FCC’s rules).

Interstate and international telecommunications carriers are required to contribute to the federal Universal Service Fund (“USF”).  Carriers providing wholesale telecommunications services are not required to contribute with respect to services sold to customers that provide a written certification that the customers themselves will make the required contributions.  If the FCC or the USF Administrator were to determine that the USF reporting for the Company, including our Communications services, are not accurate or in compliance with FCC rules, we could be subject to additional contributions, as well as to monetary fines and penalties.  In addition, the FCC may revise its USF contribution mechanisms and the services considered when calculating the contribution.  We cannot predict the outcome of any such revisions or their potential effect on our contribution obligations.  Some changes to the USF under consideration by the FCC may affect certain entities more than others, and we may be disadvantaged as compared to our competitors as a result of FCC decisions regarding USF.  In addition, the FCC may extend the obligation to contribute to the USF to certain services that we offer but that are not currently assessed USF contributions. 

FCC rules require providers that originate interstate or intrastate traffic on or destined for the public switched telephone network (“PSTN”) to transmit the telephone number associated with the calling party to the next provider in the call path. Intermediate providers, such as ourselves, must pass calling party number (“CPN”) or charge number (“CN”) signaling information they receive from other providers unaltered, to subsequent providers in the call path. While we believe that we are in compliance with this rule, to the extent that we pass traffic that does not have appropriate CPN or CN information, we could be subject to fines, cease and desist orders, or other penalties.

Sales and Marketing of Infrastructure

Infrastructure markets its services through a variety of sales channels including trade shows, conferences, press releases and public relations, our website, and partnerships with governments, wireless carriers, dealerships, OEMs and other vendors. 

Competition

Infrastructure faces competition from other charging and docking suppliers as it attempts to win the business of cities, wireless carriers, private companies, fleet managers and resellers.  We compete on the basis of price, service quality, relationship, presence and the quality of our products.  In the WNI and electrical construction space, we face competition from local, regional and national players. The competition is categorized by specialized service providers in the network, tower, construction, engineering and electrical industry. These companies range in size from ten or less employees with approximately a million dollars in revenue to thousands of employees with billions in revenue. In the EVC infrastructure space, we face competition from other EV charger installers. However our business model is founded on continued and consistent education of this emerging EVC space to both industry players and the client, providing dedicated client engagement and committed, thorough end-to-end project management with the goal of delivering a quality work product with integrity.
Government Regulation

Infrastructure is subject to varying degrees of regulation in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. Local laws and regulations, and the interpretation of such laws and regulations, differ among those jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that future regulatory, judicial and legislative changes will not have a material adverse effect on us, domestic or international regulators or third parties will not raise material issues with regard to its compliance with applicable regulations; regulatory activities will not have a material adverse effect on it.

Regulation impacting the greater EV industry continues to change rapidly in many jurisdictions which may affect the businesses advantageously or adversely depending on the decisions made.
