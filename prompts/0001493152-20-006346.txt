Corporate History and General Information
 
Veroni Brands Corp. (“Veroni” or the “Company”) was incorporated as “Echo Sound Acquisition Corporation” on December 7, 2016 under the laws of the State of Delaware. In September 2017, the Company implemented a change of control by issuing shares to new stockholders, redeeming shares of existing stockholders, electing a new officer and director and accepting the resignations of its then existing officers and directors.
 
In connection with the change in control, the stockholders of the Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the change of the Company’s name from Echo Sound Acquisition Corporation to European CPG Acquisition Corporation. In November 2017, the stockholders of the Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the change of the Company’s name to Veroni Brands Corp.
 
The Company is located at 2275 Half Day Road, Suite 346, Bannockburn, Illinois 60015. The Company’s main phone number is 888-794-2999. The Company’s fiscal year end is December 31. Neither the Company nor its predecessors have filed for bankruptcy, receivership or any similar proceedings nor are in the process of filing for bankruptcy, receivership or any similar proceedings.
 
Summary
 
The Company is an importer, seller and distributor of premium beverage, chocolate and snack products produced in Europe, engaging with both domestic and international well-known retailers so that its products are sold in thousands of stores in the United States. Veroni is also a supplier of confectionery and beverage products for major U.S. retailers under private label brands. Since adopting its current business plan in late 2017, the Company has been able to obtain and grow a distribution network, as well as contract with reliable suppliers. Veroni prides itself on its extensive market research with premium products, superior customer service, steady relationships with suppliers and retailers, and its success in developing private label collaborations and co-branded chocolate products.
 
The Company handles the product design and development phases in-house, while manufacturing is outsourced in Europe, with the whole cycle being strictly supervised by the Company in order to guarantee the highest quality products.
 
The business of the Company in 2018 focused on the import, sales and distribution of premium beverage products, primarily produced in Europe. Within this strategy, Veroni secured a long-term exclusive import and distribution agreement with a major European supplier, FoodCare Sp. z o,o., a company organized under the laws of Poland (“FoodCare”). Under that agreement, FoodCare made Veroni the sole and exclusive importer and distributor of Iron Energy in the U.S., an energy drink sponsored by celebrity boxer Mike Tyson, with access to numerous other beverage brands through this partnership. In summer 2018, the Company introduced the Iron Energy beverage to various retailers and distributors nationwide and since then has been working with many retailers and distributors to bring the product to market.
 
In January 2019, the Company expanded its product offerings and established a relationship with another manufacturer, Millano Group, to import chocolate products, as well as snacks, for distribution to major retailers throughout the United States. The Company recently became the vendor of record and successfully delivered these products to several well-known national and international retailers. Veroni’s current marketing strategy for its chocolate segment centers on supplying customers premium European chocolate products.
 
In February 2019, the Company engaged Tyler Distribution Center, Inc. and Continental Logistics, two operating companies of Port Jersey Logistics, to better serve its customers throughout the United States. Management believes that this partnership will give the Company a tremendous opportunity to support its growth, as it will be able to store and ship products and fulfill its purchase orders received from its customers.

The Company has also established relationships with other European manufacturers that can provide a wide range of “panned” products, meaning those that are coated with a sugar syrup, chocolate, or both, such as nuts, raisins, pretzels, and fruit, as well as healthy snack items, and specialty confection goods.
 
Growth Strategy
 
The Company plans to implement a multi-layered growth strategy, focusing on product enhancement and operational expansion. Veroni proposes to enhance its product offering by partnering with reputable suppliers. It also plans to scale the import, sale, and distribution of premium European confectionery items and beverage products to operate efficiently within key U.S. markets. The strategy focuses on:

● | Widening the product portfolio by introducing a healthy snack segment comprised of items such as fruit and nut bars, protein bars, performance drinks, fruit drinks, and cereals. These products will have no GMOs, zero trans fat, no artificial colors or flavors, and will be Halal and Kosher certified. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Expanding distribution by developing further relationships with national distributors and retailers. 
● | Attracting new customers by growing its network of retailers to drive direct sales. The Company plans to adopt and integrate technologies, specifically e-commerce and direct to consumer platforms, to facilitate customer acquisition, customer retention, and sales growth. Also, Veroni plans to continue to use its business development and sales professionals, as well as contract with third party brokers, to attract new customers, increase product sales, and spur growth. 
● | Maintaining existing customers by offering products that expand and complement its traditional product line. Veroni plans to introduce fresh and innovative food and beverage items to address changes in consumers’ tastes and preferences, as well as grow revenues on a per customer basis. Also, the Company plans to retain existing customers by ensuring that product quality continues to satisfy customer expectations. 
● | Scaling through mergers and acquisitions, particularly vertical integration to improve operating profit and margins. If distribution channels can be consolidated, operations can be streamlined and cost inefficiencies can be reduced to achieve economies of scale. Also, a horizontal integration strategy would allow the Company to progressively consolidate the food and beverage market.

Chocolate Products. Veroni currently distributes its chocolate products under the Sweet Desire and Baron Chocolatier brands, as well as private label chocolate bars and cups. The Company’s chocolate products are GMO free and Kosher and Halal, and contain all natural ingredients with zero trans fat, no artificial flavors or colors. The Company believes that its key competitive advantage is that it can provide premium chocolate products at mainstream prices.
 
Veroni plans to gradually increase chocolate sales by offering products made with all natural ingredients priced at a slight discount to premium brand chocolates offered by competitors such as Godiva, Russell Stover, Lindt, and Ghirardelli. It also plans to incrementally grow chocolate sales by cross-merchandising chocolate products with its retail partners’ wine products.
 
Iron Energy Drink Product sponsored by Mike Tyson. The Company believes that its Iron Energy drink, sponsored by celebrity and former boxer Mike Tyson, appeals to consumers that are active, edgy, aggressive, adventurous, fans of MMA, extreme sports, music, sporting events, surfing and fitness. Iron Energy’s target consumers are college students, young transitional adults coming out of college, independent singles in their 20’s and 30’s, athletes and the “party-goers” population.
 
The Company’s Iron Energy drink product line is available in three flavors, in 8.4oz and 11.2oz quantities:
 

● | Iron Energy Classic 
--+---------------------------
● | Iron Energy Zero Sugar 
● | Iron Energy Mojito 

 
The Company’s sales imperatives are to grow Iron Energy’s profitable volume, increase Iron Energy brand distribution, and create Iron Energy network excitement and enthusiasm for the Iron Energy portfolio. The Company will align Iron Energy Frontline and Promoted Price to Consumer (PTC) at the premium level; slightly lower to Red Bull. The Company’s price promotional schedule strategy will be designed to promote during key high-volume periods, and create excitement, trial and increased sales.
 
Other Products. In addition to the Iron Energy drink and chocolate products, the Company has ability to import and distribute the following products:

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Certifications. The Company’s distributed products are certified according to the ISO 22000 standards, and are in line with BRC and IFS food safety requirements. ISO 22000 is a food safety management system that can be applied to any organization in the food chain. IFS is a Global Food Safety Initiative recognized standard for certifying the safety and quality of food products and production processes. The BRC Global Standard for Food Safety began in the U.K. to help the food industry meet legislative requirements of the European Union General Product Safety Directive and the U.K. Food Safety Act.

Suppliers
 
On January 30, 2018, the Company entered into a distribution agreement with FoodCare. Under the terms of the Distribution Agreement, the Company became the exclusive importer and distributor of FoodCare’s products in the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (the “U.S. market”). The term of the Distribution Agreement is for a period of 10 years during which Veroni will have the exclusive right to distribute FoodCare products within the U.S. market, so long as Veroni purchases the required quantity of product from FoodCare. The Distribution Agreement is terminable upon (1) mutual consent of the parties, (2) by either party in writing without justification, if an issue is not amicably resolved in 30 days of such issue, by providing 180 days’ notice (in which case the Company would lose its exclusivity rights), or (3) immediately in the event of notice of an uncured breach in the terms of the Distribution Agreement. FoodCare Sp. z o.o., a company organized under the laws of Poland, is a manufacturer and supplier of desserts, cereals, energy drinks and other beverage products. Notably, FoodCare manufactures the “Iron Energy” drink, a product sponsored by celebrity and former boxer Mike Tyson. Other brands are N-Gine, 4Move, Frugo, Gellwe, and Fitella. Veroni failed to meets the minimum purchase requirements under the agreement, due in part to FoodCare’s failure to provide promised marketing support. The Company is currently re-evaluating the agreement and relationship with FoodCare.
 
In January 2019, the Company established a relationship with another manufacturer, Millano Group, a related party (controlled by the father of a major shareholder) to import various snacks and chocolate products for distribution to major retailers throughout the United States. Millano currently supplies approximately 85% of the Company’s product purchases.
 
Operations
 
Veroni begins its product development process by generating new ideas for products. Product and packaging samples are then commissioned to the suppliers for testing and quality assurance. When a product design is finalized and a price is confirmed with suppliers and manufacturers, a purchase order is placed. Products are manufactured through suppliers in Europe that procure their own raw materials for finished and packaged products. Typically, the manufacturing process takes 4 to 6 weeks. After manufacturing is completed, the Company organizes shipment and/or storage, depending on agreements with retailers and third-party distributors. On average, the lead time from order processing to product delivery is approximately 13 weeks. As of the date of this report, the current COVID-19 crisis has resulted in the Company experiencing longer lead times in obtaining product from its manufacturers and shipping to its customers.
 
At December 31, 2019, Veroni has three employees. The Company’s corporate office is located in Bannockburn, Illinois and it has an arrangement with Port Jersey Logistics, a third-party logistics company that provides warehousing, fulfillment and transportation services.
 
Key Markets and Market Overview
 
Veroni’s primary markets include dollar stores, multi-outlets, grocery stores, convenience stores, distributors, and retailers across the U.S., with dollar stores accounting for approximately 70% of sales. As between sales of branded items versus private label products, private label currently accounts for approximately 70% of sales. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company had two customers whose sales accounted for approximately 73% of revenue. As of December 31, 2019, one customer comprised approximately 86% or $1,453,432 of the Company’s combined accounts receivable and contract receivables with recourse.
 
Confectionery Market Overview. According to IBISWorld, the revenue of the U.S. confectionery market for 2018 was $51.9 billion, and annual revenue growth for the past five years was around 0.7%. Revenue is forecast to grow at an annualized rate of 1.0% over the next four years to 2023. The major segments purchasing confectionery products include wholesalers, grocery stores and markets, mass merchandisers and convenience stores. The next five years are expected to maintain a positive outlook for the U.S. confectionery industry. Continued economic recovery will further boost consumer spending on confectionery and snacks, especially on gourmet, premium dark chocolate and gummy candy products.
 
Chocolate Market Overview. According to Statista, chocolate and confectionery consumption in the U.S. is expected to continue its upward trend (from $139.9 billion in 2019 to $165.2 billion by 2023), supported by population growth and rising purchasing power. Consumers are becoming more aware of the health effects associated with consuming excessive sugar and fat. As a response to changing preferences, low-calorie, reduced-sugar and more nutritious types of chocolate are becoming more popular. Premium, dark and organic chocolates are key products benefitting from this trend.

The chocolate production industry is moderately concentrated with the top four players (Hershey, Mars, Ferrero and Lindt) accounting for 60.6% of market share in 2019, according to IBIS World. The industry has consolidated over the past five years through acquisitions. In the past five years, industry producers have experienced stable competition from foreign chocolate producers. Although brand recognition is important in this industry, as many brands have been in the market for decades, producers of chocolate compete based on the quality of their products, as determined by taste, quality of ingredients and more recently, nutritional value.
 
Energy Drink Market Overview. According to Statista, The U.S. energy drinks market size is expected to grow to $26.9 million by 2025, with a compound annual growth rate of 7.2% during the forecast period. Energy drinks offer a convenient way to boost energy as an alternative for coffee and tea, and new natural ingredients for consumers’ growing health consciousness have been driving the market. Energy beverage consumption has turned into a status symbol, especially for youth. Such consumer behavior is expected to further drive the overall market demand. In 2017, energy drink dollar sales in the U.S. comprised 30.1% of all packaged beverage sales, exceeding sales of carbonated soft drinks, which accounted for 28.5% of the market.
 
According to IBISWorld, the energy drink industry is extremely concentrated, with the four biggest companies accounting for an estimated 80.8% of the revenue in 2018. This level of concentration has been consistent over the last five years to 2018, and it is mainly due to the strong brand recognition of the largest companies – Red Bull, Monster and Rockstar.
 
Healthy Snacks Market Overview. According to Statista, the global healthy snacks market size is expected to grow to $32.9 billion by 2025, with a compound annual growth rate of 5.2% during the forecast period. Increasing awareness regarding health and wellness benefits offered by the products among consumers is likely to be a key trend driving the market. The consumption of healthy snacks is growing, as such snacks meet various dietary requirements, such as being sugar-free and having low salt and cholesterol content. However, the high cost of production, due to volatile prices of raw materials is expected to negatively influence the growth of the market over the forecast period.
 
Within the food and beverage industry, the global health and wellness sector is witnessing a “healthy” boom that shapes the ever-growing market as never before. Increasingly, consumers are developing food sensitivities and adopting healthier and more active lifestyles, leading them to seek healthier nutritional alternatives and consume fresh and organic food.
