ITEM 1. BUSINESS
The Company
Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Apogee, the Company or we) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Minnesota in 1949. We are a world leader in certain technologies involving the design and development of value-added glass products and services. 
Our Company has four reporting segments, with three of the segments serving the commercial construction market: 

• | The Architectural Glass segment fabricates coated, high-performance glass used globally in customized window and wall systems. For fiscal 2017, the Architectural Glass segment accounted for approximately 33 percent of our net sales.


• | The Architectural Framing Systems segment designs, engineers, fabricates and finishes the aluminum frames used in customized window, curtainwall, storefront and entrance systems comprising the outside skin of buildings. For fiscal 2017, the Architectural Framing Systems segment accounted for approximately 35 percent of our net sales.


• | The Architectural Services segment provides full-service installation of the walls of glass, windows and other curtainwall products making up the outside skin of buildings. For fiscal 2017, the Architectural Services segment accounted for approximately 24 percent of our net sales.


• | The Large-Scale Optical Technologies (LSO) segment manufactures value-added glass and acrylic products for framing and display applications. For fiscal 2017, this segment accounted for approximately 8 percent of our net sales.

On December 14, 2016, we acquired substantially all the assets of Sotawall, Inc. (now operating under the name Sotawall Limited or "Sotawall"), a privately-held designer and fabricator of high-performance, unitized curtainwall systems for commercial construction projects based in the Toronto, Canada area, for approximately $138 million. Sotawall's results of operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements and within the Architectural Framing Systems segment since the date of acquisition.
Strategy
Our overall strategy in the Architectural Glass and Architectural Framing Systems segments is to deliver growth faster than our commercial construction markets. We accomplish this through geographic and market segment expansion and new product offerings, while differentiating ourselves through superior service and lead times. In recent years, we have increased our focus on window and curtainwall retrofit and renovation of existing commercial buildings. We have seen increased interest from the non-residential and high-end multi-family residential building sectors in upgrading façades and improving energy efficiency. We consider this to be a significant opportunity for Apogee in the coming years.
In the Architectural Services segment, our emphasis is on improving margins through focused project selection, while continuing to deliver organic growth in line with our available project management capacity. 
Within the LSO segment, our strategy is to grow domestically and internationally by continuing to convert the custom picture framing and fine art markets from clear uncoated glass and acrylic products to value-added products that protect art from UV damage and minimize reflection. Additionally, we have begun to enter new display markets that desire the value-added properties our glass and acrylic products provide in an effort to diversify LSO's product offerings.
We believe each of our segments has the ability to grow organically through entry into new geographies, further penetration in existing geographies and introduction of new products. We also regularly evaluate business development opportunities in adjacent sectors. Any of these strategies can also be executed by acquisition or strategic alliances. 
Finally, we are constantly working to improve the efficiency and productivity of our operations by implementing lean manufacturing disciplines and automation. We expect these efforts to continue to deliver gross margin expansion into the foreseeable future.
Products and Services
Architectural Glass, Architectural Framing Systems and Architectural Services segments
These segments participate in various phases of the value chain to design, engineer, fabricate and install customized glass and aluminum window, curtainwall, storefront and entrance systems comprising the outside skin of buildings in the commercial, institutional and high-end multi-family residential construction sectors. 
In our Architectural Glass segment, we add ultra-thin, high-performance coatings to uncoated glass to create a variety of aesthetic characteristics, unique designs and energy efficiency, including varying levels of solar energy management, aligned with the industry trend of increasingly energy-efficient buildings. We also laminate layers of glass and vinyl to protect against hurricanes and other severe impacts, and temper, or heat strengthen, glass to provide additional strength. Our high-performance glass is

custom made-to-order and is typically fabricated into insulating and/or laminated glass units for installation into window, curtainwall, storefront or entrance systems.
Within our Architectural Framing Systems segment, we design and fabricate window, curtainwall, storefront and entrance systems using our customized aluminum and glass, or glass supplied by others. We also provide finishing services for metal components used in windows and curtainwall, as well as plastic components for other products.
By integrating technical capabilities, project management skills and field installation services, our Architectural Services segment provides design, engineering, fabrication and installation expertise for the outside skin of buildings. Our ability to efficiently design high-quality window and curtainwall systems and effectively manage the installation of building façades allows our customers to meet or exceed the timing and cost requirements of their jobs.
Our product and service offerings allow architects to create distinctive looks for office towers, hotels, education facilities and dormitories, health care facilities, government buildings, retail centers and multi-family residential buildings, while meeting functional requirements such as energy efficiency, hurricane, blast and other impact resistance and/or sound control.
LSO segment
The LSO segment provides coated glass and acrylic primarily for use in framing and display applications. Products vary based on size and coatings applied to provide conservation-grade UV protection, anti-reflective and anti-static properties and/or security features. 
Product Demand and Distribution Channels
Architectural Glass, Architectural Framing Systems and Architectural Services segments
Demand for the products and services offered by our Architectural segments is affected by changes in the North American commercial construction industries, as well as by changes in general economic conditions. Additionally, the Architectural Glass segment has an operation in Brazil and is, therefore, also impacted by Brazil's commercial construction industry and general economic conditions. 
We look at several external indicators to analyze potential demand for our products and services, such as U.S. job growth, office space vacancy rates, credit and interest rates available for commercial construction projects, architectural billing statistics and material costs. We also rely on our own internal indicators to analyze demand. This includes our sales pipeline, made up of contracts in review, projects awarded or committed, and bidding activity. Our sales pipeline, together with ongoing feedback, analysis and data from our customers, architects and building owners, provide visibility into near- and medium-term future demand. Additionally, we evaluate data on U.S. non-residential construction market activity, industry analysis and longer-term trends provided by external data sources. 
Our architectural products and services are used in subsets of the construction industry differentiated by building type, level of customization required, customers, geographic location and project size. 
Building type - The construction industry is typically segmented into residential construction and non-residential construction, which includes commercial, industrial and institutional construction. Our products and services are primarily used in commercial buildings (office towers, hotels and retail centers) and institutional buildings (education facilities and dormitories, health care facilities and government buildings), as well as in high-end multi-family residential buildings (a subset of residential construction).
Level of customization - The large majority of our projects involve a high degree of customization, as the product or service is based on customer-specified requirements for aesthetics, performance and size, and is designed to satisfy local building codes. 
Customers and distribution channels - Our customers are mainly glazing subcontractors and general contractors, with project design being influenced by architects and building owners. Our high-performance architectural glass is primarily sold using a direct sales force and independent sales representatives. Installation services are marketed by a direct sales force in certain metropolitan areas in the U.S. We also have the ability to provide remote project management throughout the U.S. We market our custom and standard windows, curtainwall, storefront and entrance systems using a combination of direct sales forces, independent sales representatives and distributors.
Geographic location - We primarily supply architectural glass products to customers in North America, with some international sales of our high-performance architectural glass. We estimate the U.S. demand for architectural glass fabrication in non-residential buildings is in excess of $1 billion annually. Our aluminum framing systems, including windows, curtainwall, storefront and entrances, are marketed in the U.S. and Canada, and we estimate demand to be in excess of $3 billion annually. In installation 
5

services, we are one of only a few architectural glass installation companies in the U.S. to have a national presence, and we estimate the U.S. demand to be in the range of $10 to $15 billion. 
Project size - Our Architectural Glass segment primarily serves mid-size to monumental high-profile projects. Architectural Framing Systems primarily targets small and mid-size projects, and Architectural Services primarily serves mid-size projects. 
LSO segment
In our LSO segment, we have the largest domestically manufactured brand of value-added glass and acrylic used in the custom picture framing market. Under the Tru Vue brand, products are sold primarily in North America through national and regional retail chains using a direct sales force, as well as through local picture framing shops using an independent distribution network. We also supply our glass and acrylic products to museums and public and private galleries and collections worldwide through independent distributors.
Competitive Conditions
Architectural Glass, Architectural Framing Systems and Architectural Services segments
The North American commercial construction market is highly fragmented. Competitive factors include price, product quality, product attributes and performance, reliable service, on-time delivery, lead-time, warranty and the ability to provide technical engineering and design services. To protect and enhance our competitive position, we maintain strong relationships with architects, who influence the selection of products and services on a project, and with general contractors, who initiate projects and develop specifications. 
In our Architectural Glass segment, we experience competition from regional glass fabricators who can provide certain products with attributes similar to our products. Within the market sector for large, complex projects, we encounter competition from international companies, which have products that may be equivalent to or have different characteristics than we provide. This international competition has strengthened in recent years due to the relative strength of the U.S. dollar. 
The commercial window and storefront manufacturing industry is highly fragmented, and our Architectural Framing Systems segment competes against several national, regional and local aluminum window and storefront manufacturers, as well as regional paint and anodizing companies. When providing installation services, our Architectural Services segment competes against national, regional and local glass installation companies. 
LSO segment
Product attributes, price, quality, marketing and service are the primary competitive factors in the LSO segment. Our competitive strengths include our excellent relationships with customers, innovative marketing programs and the performance of our value-added products. We compete with certain European valued-added glass and acrylic products for picture framing.
Warranties
We offer product and service warranties that we believe are competitive for the markets in which our products and services are sold. The nature and extent of these warranties depend upon the product or service, the market and, in some cases, the customer being served. Our standard warranties are generally from two to 10 years for our architectural glass, curtainwall and window system products, while we generally offer warranties of two years or less on our other products and services. 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
Raw materials used within the Architectural Glass segment include flat glass, vinyl, silicone sealants and lumber. The Architectural Framing Systems segment's materials include aluminum billet and extrusions, fabricated glass, plastic extrusions, hardware, paint and chemicals. Within the Architectural Services segment, materials used include fabricated glass, aluminum extrusions and fabricated metal panels. The LSO segment mainly uses glass and acrylics. A majority of our raw materials are readily available from a variety of domestic and international sources. 
Trademarks and Patents
We have several trademarks and trade names that we believe have significant value in the marketing of our products, including APOGEE®. Trademark registrations in the U.S. are generally for a term of 10 years, renewable every 10 years as long as the trademark is used in the regular course of trade.
Within the Architectural Glass segment, VIRACON®, DIGITALDISTINCTIONS®, ROOMSIDE®, EXTREMEDGE®, BUILDING DESIGN®, GLASS IS EVERYTHING®, CLEARPOINT®, CYBERSHIELD® and STORMGUARD® are registered trademarks. VIRASPAN™ is an unregistered trademark. In addition, GLASSEC®, INSULATTO® and BLINDATTO® are registered trademarks in Brazil. GLASSECVIRACON™ is an unregistered trademark in Brazil.

Within the LSO segment, TRU VUE®, CONSERVATION CLEAR®, CONSERVATION MASTERPIECE ACRYLIC®, CONSERVATION REFLECTION CONTROL®, ULTRAVUE®, MUSEUM GLASS®, OPTIUM®, PREMIUM CLEAN®, REFLECTION CONTROL®, AR REFLECTION-FREE®, TRU VUE AR®, OPTIUM ACRYLIC®, OPTIUM MUSEUM ACRYLIC®, CONSERVATION MASTERPIECE®, STATICSHIELD®, TRULIFE® and VISTA AR® are registered trademarks. TRULIFE INFINITY FRAMETM, THE DIFFERENCE IS CLEARTM and TRU FRAMEABLE MOMENTSTM are unregistered trademarks.
We have several patents pertaining to our glass coating methods and products, including our UV coating and etch processes for anti-reflective glass for the picture framing industry and fine art market, as well as a patent for an indirect daylighting device and patents for hybrid window wall/curtain wall systems and methods of installation. Despite being a point of differentiation from our competitors, no single patent is considered to be material.
Seasonality
We do not experience a significant seasonal effect in our Architectural segments. However, the construction industry is highly cyclical in nature and can be influenced differently by the effects of local economies.
Within the LSO segment, picture framing glass and acrylic sales tend to increase in the September-to-December timeframe, but the timing of customer promotional activities may offset some of this seasonal impact.
Working Capital Requirements
Trade accounts receivable is the largest component of working capital for the Company, including receivables relating to contractual retention amounts that can be outstanding throughout a project's duration within the Architectural Services segment. Inventory requirements are not significant in any of our segments, although the LSO segment requires greater inventory levels as it builds to stock to meet the demands of its customers.
Backlog
Backlog represents the dollar amount of signed contracts or firm orders, generally as a result of a competitive bidding process, which is expected to be recognized as revenue primarily in the near-term. Backlog is not a term defined under U.S. GAAP and is not a measure of contract profitability. Backlog should not be used as the sole indicator of our future revenue because we have a substantial amount of projects with short lead times that book-and-bill within the same reporting period that are not included in backlog. We have strong visibility beyond backlog as projects awarded, verbal commitments and bidding activities are monitored separately and not included in backlog.
Architectural Glass segment backlog as of year-end was $66.4 million, compared to $62.4 million in the prior year, net of intersegment eliminations. This segment has strategically shortened lead-times, with capability and productivity improvements, in order to serve mid-size projects where there is a higher level of book-and-bill activity within quarters. The backlog is all expected to be filled in fiscal 2018. 
Architectural Framing Systems segment backlog has grown to $245.4 million at year-end, compared to $123.0 million at the end of the prior year, due to recent increased order activity, particularly of longer lead-time contracts. The acquisition of Sotawall contributed approximately $70 million to this segment's backlog. Approximately 75 percent of the backlog in this segment is expected to be filled in fiscal 2018, with the remainder expected to be filled in fiscal 2019 and beyond.
Backlog in the Architectural Services segment declined from $320.4 million at the end of the prior year to $255.1 million at March 4, 2017, due to timing of firm orders and signed contracts. Approximately 67 percent of the backlog in this segment is expected to be filled during fiscal 2018, with the remainder expected to be filled in fiscal 2019 and beyond. 
Backlog is not a significant metric for the LSO segment, as orders are typically booked and billed within a short time frame.

Research and Development
The amount spent on research and development activities was $8.6 million, $8.0 million and $6.5 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Of this amount, $2.2 million, $2.4 million and $2.4 million, respectively, were focused primarily upon design of custom window and curtainwall systems in accordance with customer specifications and are included in cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
Environment
We use hazardous materials in our manufacturing operations, and have air and water emissions that require controls. As a result, we are subject to stringent federal, state and local regulations governing the storage and use of these materials and disposal of wastes. We contract with outside vendors to collect and dispose of waste at our production facilities in compliance with applicable environmental laws. In addition, we have procedures in place that we believe enable us to properly manage the regulated materials used in and wastes created by our manufacturing processes. We believe we are currently in material compliance with such laws and regulations. While we will continue to incur environmental compliance costs for our ongoing manufacturing operations, we do not expect these to be material to our consolidated financial statements.
In fiscal 2008, we acquired one manufacturing facility that had certain historical environmental conditions. We are working to remediate those conditions, and the remediation activities are being conducted without significant disruption to our operations. 
Employees
The Company employed 5,511 and 4,614 persons on March 4, 2017 and February 27, 2016, respectively. At March 4, 2017, 624 of these employees were represented by U.S. labor unions. 
International Sales
Information regarding export and international sales is included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, within Note 16 of our Consolidated Financial Statements.
