ITEM 1. BUSINESSS
OVERVIEW
Reliant Bancorp, Inc. (f/k/a Commerce Union Bancshares, Inc.), is a Tennessee corporation and the holding company for and the sole shareholder of Reliant Bank. Reliant Bancorp is registered as a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 as amended ("Bank Holding Company Act"). Reliant Bank is a commercial bank chartered under Tennessee law and a member of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve").
Reliant Bank, Reliant Bancorp's wholly-owned subsidiary, provides a full range of traditional banking products and services to corporate and consumer clients throughout Middle Tennessee and the Nashville-Davidson-Murfreesboro-Franklin, TN Metropolitan Statistical Area (the “Nashville MSA”) and Chattanooga, Tennessee. Reliant Bank operates banking centers in Cheatham, Davidson, Hamilton, Hickman, Maury, Montgomery, Robertson, Rutherford, Sumner, and Williamson counties, Tennessee. Additionally, Reliant Bank operates mortgage offices in Brentwood, Hendersonville, and Memphis, Tennessee, as well as two in Little Rock and two in Hot Springs, Arkansas. 
HISTORY AND GROWTH
Reliant Bank was organized on April 17, 2006, as a state-chartered bank, under the laws of the State of Tennessee. Reliant Bank opened for business on August 14, 2006. 
Reliant Bancorp, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Tennessee on March 4, 2011, to serve as a holding company for Reliant Bank. Reliant Bancorp became the holding company for, and sole shareholder of, Reliant Bank upon the completion of Reliant Bank’s reorganization into a holding company corporate structure on June 6, 2012. Until December 31, 2017, the Company operated under the name “Commerce Union Bancshares, Inc.” 
Reliant Mortgage Ventures, LLC ("RMV") was organized on November 15, 2011 as a joint venture between VHC Fund 1, LLC ("VHC") and Legacy Reliant Bank (as defined below) to offer mortgage banking services within the Legacy Reliant Bank's market footprint. The Bank controls 51% of RMV's governance rights and is scheduled to receive 30% of RMV's profits once VHC recovers its capital contributions.
On July 7, 2015, the Company’s common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”).
Reliant Investment Holdings, LLC ("Holdings") was organized on October 26, 2018 as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank to offer investment services to the Bank.
As of December 31, 2019, the Company had grown to approximately $1.9 billion in assets, including approximately $1.4 billion of loans-held-for-investment and approximately $1.6 billion of deposits. 
ACQUISITIONS
On April 1, 2015, Reliant Bank and legacy Reliant Bank, a Tennessee state-chartered bank established in January 2006 and headquartered in Brentwood, Tennessee, ("Legacy Reliant Bank") completed a merger of equals. Legacy Reliant Bank shareholders received 3,069,030 shares of common stock, valued at approximately $47.9 million. As of merger date, the combined companies reported total assets of $790.8 million with $11.4 million of goodwill, total loans-held-for-investment of $561.4 million and total deposits of $623.9 million. The transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger using the acquisition method of accounting and Legacy Reliant Bank is considered to have acquired Reliant Bancorp in this transaction. As a result, the historical financial statements of the combined company are the historical financial statements of Legacy Reliant Bank following the completion of the merger. 
On January 1, 2018, Reliant Bancorp completed its acquisition of Community First, Inc. ("Community First") the parent company for Community First Bank & Trust, a Tennessee state-chartered bank headquartered in Columbia Tennessee, for 2,416,444 shares of Company common stock valued at approximately $62.0 million, acquiring assets with an approximate value of $480.0 million, including goodwill of approximately $32.1 million, loans-held-for-investment of approximately $316.2 million and deposits of approximately $432.9 million ( the "Community First Transaction"). Additionally, outstanding restricted share awards became 
5

fully vested and converted automatically into the right to receive merger consideration. In connection with the Community First Transaction, pursuant to supplemental indentures, in each case dated as of January 1, 2018, by and between the Company and Wilmington Trust Company, as trustee, the Company assumed all of Community First's obligations with respect to its preferred trust securities. 
On January 1, 2020, Reliant Bancorp completed the acquisition of TCB Holdings, the parent company for Community Bank & Trust, a Tennessee state-chartered bank headquartered in Ashland City, Tennessee (“CBT”). Upon completion of the TCB Holdings Transaction, and based on December 31, 2019 financial data, the Company would have approximately $2.1 billion in total consolidated assets including approximately $52.3 million of goodwill, gross loans-held-for-investment of approximately $1.6 billion, and total deposits of approximately $1.8 billion. 
On October 22, 2019, Reliant Bancorp entered into a definitive agreement to acquire FABK, the parent company for First Advantage Bank (“FAB”), a Tennessee state-chartered bank headquartered in Clarksville, Tennessee. The Company expects to complete this transaction effective April1, 2020. Upon completion of this transaction along with the TCB Holdings, using December 31, 2019 financial data, the Company would have approximately $2.9 billion in total consolidated assets including goodwill of $94.8 million gross loans of approximately $2.2 billion and total deposits of approximately $2.4 billion.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2019, Reliant Bancorp and Reliant Bank had 302 employees on a full-time or part-time basis. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our relationship with our employees is good. 
PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
Reliant Bank is a full-service community bank. Our principal business is banking, which consists of lending and deposit gathering (as well as other banking-related products and services) that are offered to businesses and individuals within our market footprint. 
Loan Products and Services
We offer a full range of lending products, including commercial, real estate and consumer loans. We compete for these loans with other financial institutions who are also well established in our geographic markets.
Our profitability depends upon our responsible lending practices, which will help ensure our long-term, balanced growth in assets, loans, deposits and net income. To achieve this goal, our strategy is to: (1) expand loans and deposits through organic market share growth and strategic acquisitions; (2) provide customers with a breadth of financial products and services; (3) employ, empower and motivate our employees to provide personalized customer service, consistent with the best traditions of community banking, while maximizing profits; and (4) maintain exceptional asset quality and control overhead expenses.
Depository Products and Services
We seek to establish a strong base of core deposits including savings, noninterest-bearing checking, interest-bearing checking, money market and certificate of deposit accounts, including access to products offered through various Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service ("CDARS") programs.
Our ability to gather deposits is enhanced by the comprehensive relationships our directors and bankers have built with the businesses and individuals who live and do business in our market footprint. Rates paid on deposits vary among banking markets and deposit categories due to different terms and conditions, individual deposit size, services rendered, and rates paid by competitors on similar deposit products. We act as a depository for a number of state and local governments and governmental agencies or municipalities. Such public fund deposits are often subject to competitive bid and in many cases must be secured by pledging a portion of our investment securities or a letter of credit. 
We also offer our commercial clients a comprehensive array of treasury management services, which include remote deposit capture, on-line wire origination, enhanced Automated Clearing House ("ACH") origination services, positive pay, zero balance and sweep accounts, automated bill pay services, electronic receivables processing, lockbox processing, merchant card acceptance services, small business and commercial credit cards, and corporate purchasing cards.
Other Banking Products and Services 
We offer a broad array of convenience-centered products and services, including MoneyPass, a nationwide network of surcharge free ATMs available to our clients, 24-hour telephone and online banking, mobile banking, debit and credit cards, direct deposit and mobile deposit options.

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT
We face competition in all phases of our operation from a variety of competitors, many of which are larger and have access to more financial resources than us. Such competitors include national, regional, Internet banks and FinTechs. We also face competition from many others types of financial institutions, including, community banks, savings and loans associations, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, and other financial intermediaries Additionally, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of our non-bank competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. 
We believe that we are able to successfully compete with other financial institutions in our market footprint by focusing on personal service and offering products that meet the needs of the businesses and consumers who work and live in those markets.
AVAILABLE INFORMATION
We are required to file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), which are available to the public from commercial document retrieval services and at the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Our common stock is listed and traded on Nasdaq under the symbol “RBNC”. 
We also make available on our website (http:// www.reliantbank.com) all of the reports that we file with the SEC and amendments to those reports, including related exhibits and supplemental schedules, filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with the SEC. Information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. Please note that our website address is provided as an inactive textual reference only. We intend to disclose on our website any amendments or waivers to our Code of Ethics that are required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 5.05 of Form 8-K.
SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
General 
We are subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state law. These laws and related regulations are generally intended to protect depositors and customers, not shareholders. To the extent that the following information describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statute or regulation. Any change in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on our business, operations, and prospects. We cannot accurately predict the nature or the extent of the effects on our business and earnings that fiscal or monetary policies, or new federal or state legislation or regulation may have in the future. 
Holding Company Regulation
Reliant Bancorp is registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act, and we have elected under the Bank Holding Company Act to be treated as a financial holding company. In order to qualify to be a financial holding company, a bank holding company and each of its subsidiary depository institutions must be “well capitalized” and “well managed” and each subsidiary depository institution must have at least a “satisfactory” rating under The Community Reinvestment Act (which is discussed below). 
As a financial holding company, we are subject to the supervision of and to regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) and subject to the reporting and other requirements of the Bank Holding Company Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the Federal Reserve. Moreover, as the holding company for a bank chartered in Tennessee, we also are subject to the Tennessee Banking Act, and as a Tennessee corporation, we are subject generally to the Tennessee Business Corporation Act.
As a financial holding company, Reliant Bancorp is required by law and Federal Reserve policy to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for its bank subsidiary, Reliant Bank, and to commit resources to support Reliant Bank. This support can be required at times when it would not be in the best interest of Reliant Bancorp’s shareholders or creditors to provide it. 
The Bank Holding Company Act and the regulations thereunder place limitations on the activities in which a bank holding company may engage. Subject to certain exceptions, the Bank Holding Company Act and the regulations thereunder generally prohibit a bank holding company from engaging in or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting stock of any company engaged in non-banking activities. An exception to this prohibition is for activities expressly found by the Federal Reserve to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Financial holding companies, however, are allowed to engage without prior Federal Reserve approval in a broader range of banking and non-banking activities 
7

that are deemed to be financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity. These “financial in nature” activities include securities underwriting, dealing and market making; organizing, sponsoring and managing mutual funds; insurance underwriting and agency; merchant banking activities; and other activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be closely related to banking. 
Under the Change in Bank Control Act and associated Federal Reserve regulations, generally, any person that, directly or indirectly or in concert with one or more other persons, seeks to acquire control of a bank holding company or a Federal Reserve member bank (such as Reliant Bank) must give the Federal Reserve 60 days’ prior written notice before acquiring control of the bank holding company or member bank. Under the applicable regulations, control is defined as the ownership or control of or power to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company or member bank. The regulations also provide for a presumption of control if a person would own, control, or hold with power to vote 10% or more (but less than 25%) of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company or member bank and either the institution has securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act or no other person owns a greater percentage of that class of voting securities.
Reliant Bancorp is subject to the registration, disclosure, reporting, and other requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and administered by the SEC. Because the Company’s common stock is listed on Nasdaq, the Company is subject to Nasdaq’s rules for listed companies.
Bank Regulation
Reliant Bank is subject to extensive federal and state regulation that significantly affects its business and operations. As a Tennessee state-chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve system, the Bank is primarily subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve and the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions (the “TDFI”). The Bank is also subject to various regulations promulgated by the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency responsible for consumer protection in the financial sector. 
The Federal Reserve and the TDFI regularly examine the Bank’s operations and have the authority to approve or disapprove of mergers to which the Bank is a party, the Bank’s establishment of new branches, and similar corporate actions. Both regulatory agencies have the power to take enforcement action to prevent or halt the continuance of unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations of law. The FDIC, as the insurer of the Bank’s deposits, also has certain regulatory authority over and requires certain routine reporting by the Bank. 
As a bank chartered under Tennessee law, Reliant Bank is subject to the provisions of the Tennessee Banking Act and, to the extent not inconsistent with the Tennessee Banking Act, the provisions of the Tennessee Business Corporation Act.
Dividends
Reliant Bancorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from Reliant Bank. The principal source of Reliant Bancorp’s cash flow for operations, including the payment of interest on its trust preferred securities and subordinated notes, the payment of other indebtedness, and the payment of dividends to holders of its common stock, is dividends that Reliant Bancorp receives from Reliant Bank. 
Various federal and state laws, rules, and regulations limit the amount of dividends that a subsidiary bank can pay to its parent holding company without regulatory approval. Generally, the Bank cannot pay dividends in any calendar year that exceed its net income for that year plus its retained net income for the prior two calendar years without prior regulatory approval. Additionally, the Bank is generally prohibited from paying dividends if the Bank is not adequately capitalized or if payment of the dividends would cause the Bank to become undercapitalized. Under applicable federal capital adequacy guidelines, banks are also subject to dividend limitations and restrictions if they fail to maintain an appropriate capital conservation buffer. Federal and state bank regulators also have the authority to prohibit the payment of dividends by banks if they determine the payment of dividends to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice.
There are also limitations on Reliant Bancorp’s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders. The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement with regard to the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies. This policy statement provides generally that a bank holding company should not pay, or should defer or significantly reduce, dividends if the bank holding company’s net income available to shareholders over the last four quarters (net of dividends paid) is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends or if the bank holding company’s prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition. A bank holding company subject to the federal capital adequacy regulations is also subject to dividend limitations and restrictions if it fails to maintain an appropriate capital conservation buffer. Under Tennessee 
8

law, Reliant Bancorp is not permitted to pay dividends if, after giving effect to the dividends, it would not be able to pay its debts as they come due in the usual course of business or if its assets would be less than the sum of its liabilities plus the amount necessary to satisfy the rights of preferred shareholders, if any, upon dissolution. The Company may from time to time also be subject to contractual restrictions on its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders. 
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, Reliant Bancorp paid dividends totaling $0.36 per share on its common stock for a total of $3,053 in aggregate dividend declarations for the year. The amount and timing of all future dividend payments, if any, is subject to our board’s discretion and our compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations and regulatory guidance, and will depend on our earnings, capital position, financial condition and other factors, including new regulatory capital requirements, as they become known to us.
Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders 
Transactions between Reliant Bank and its affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve’s Regulation W, which generally:
•limit the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10.0% of the bank’s capital stock and surplus;
•limit the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20.0% of the bank’s capital stock and surplus; and
•require that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank or subsidiary, as those provided to a non-affiliate.
An affiliate of a bank generally is any company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the bank which is not a subsidiary of the bank. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans to an affiliate, the purchase of assets from an affiliate, the issuance of a guarantee on behalf of an affiliate, the purchase of securities issued by an affiliate, and other similar types of transactions.
The Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve’s Regulation O impose restrictions on Reliant Bank’s authority to extend credit to its executive officers, directors, and greater than 10% shareholders, as well as companies such persons' control. Among other things, these extensions of credit must be made on terms (including interest rates charged and collateral required) substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated persons, or be made as part of a benefit or compensation program and on terms widely available to employees, and must not involve a greater than normal risk of repayment. In addition, the amount of loans Reliant Bank may make to these persons is based, in part, on the bank’s capital position, and specified approval procedures must be followed in making loans which exceed specified amounts.
Capital Adequacy 
Federal banking regulators have implemented risk-based capital adequacy guidelines for certain bank or financial holding companies and insured depository institutions.
In July 2013, in response to the statutory requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), federal banking regulators adopted regulations implementing the Basel Capital Adequacy Accord (“Basel III”), which had been approved by the Basel member central bank governors in 2010 as an agreement among the countries’ central banks and bank regulators on the amount of capital banks must hold as a cushion against losses and insolvency. These regulations provide for the following minimum capital to risk-weighted assets requirements in order for an institution to be considered “adequately capitalized”: a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, and a total capital ratio of 8.0%. Additionally, to be considered “adequately capitalized,” an institution must have a leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to total assets) of at least 4.0%. In order to be considered “well capitalized,” an institution must have a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.0%, a total capital ratio of 10.0%, and a leverage ratio of 5.0%. 
9

Under Basel III, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer composed of common equity Tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The buffer is measured relative to risk-weighted assets. The capital conservation buffer was phased in starting January 1, 2016, and it became fully phased in on January 1, 2019. A banking organization with a buffer greater than 2.5% is not subject to limitations on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments. A banking organization with a buffer of less than 2.5% is subject to increasingly stringent limitations as the buffer approaches zero. The regulation also prohibits a banking organization from making distributions or discretionary bonus payments during any quarter if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5% at the beginning of the quarter. The eligible retained income of a banking organization is defined as its net income for the four calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter, based on the organization’s quarterly regulatory reports, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income. The minimum risk-based capital requirements plus the capital conservation buffer exceed the current prompt corrective action (PCA) well-capitalized thresholds (discussed below).
In July 2019, federal banking regulators issued a final rule intended to simplify certain aspects of the regulatory capital rules for banking organizations, such as Reliant Bank, that are not advanced approaches banking organizations. This final is intended to simplify the regulatory capital treatment for mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences, investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions, and the calculation of minority interests. These changes were effective for Reliant Bank effective January 1, 2020. 
Bank holding companies that qualify for the Federal Reserve’s Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement (the “Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement”) are exempt from consolidated capital requirements. The Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement is generally applicable to bank holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $3 billion that are not engaged in significant nonbanking activities, either directly or through a nonbank subsidiary; do not conduct significant off-balance sheet activities, either directly or through a nonbank subsidiary; and do not have a material amount of debt or equity securities outstanding (other than trust preferred securities) that are registered with the SEC. Historically, the Company has qualified for the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement and, therefore, has not been subject to the Federal Reserve’s capital adequacy guidelines on a consolidated basis at the bank holding company level. Upon completion of the FABK Transaction, the Company is expected to have total consolidated assets in excess of $3 billion, in which event we will be subject to consolidated capital requirements beginning January 1, 2021 if consolidated assets are in excess of $3 billion at June 30, 2020. 
The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the “Regulatory Relief Act”), enacted May 24, 2018, provided for the simplification of the regulatory capital rules for certain financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. The Regulatory Relief Act required the federal banking agencies to develop a community bank leverage ratio (“CBLR”) for qualifying banks and holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion and an appropriate risk profile. The Regulatory Relief Act mandated a minimum CBLR of not less than 8% and not more than 10%. In October 2019, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule implementing the CBLR framework and setting the CBLR at 9%. Under the final rule, the CBLR is calculated, generally, as Tier 1 capital divided by average total consolidated assets (minus amounts deducted from Tier 1 capital). Under this final rule, which was effective January 1, 2020, a qualifying community banking organization that has opted to use the CBLR framework is considered to have met the generally applicable risk-based and leverage capital requirements, the capital ratio requirements to be considered “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action framework (discussed below), and any other capital or leverage requirements to which the qualifying community banking organization is subject, if it maintains a CBLR greater than 9%. A qualifying community banking organization is a non-advanced approaches banking organization, such as Reliant, that has a leverage ratio of greater than 9%, total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, total off-balance sheet exposures (excluding derivatives other than sold credit derivatives and unconditionally cancelable commitments) of 25% or less of total consolidated assets, and total trading assets and trading liabilities of 5% or less of total consolidated assets. While we believe we qualify as a qualifying community banking organization, we have not opted into the CBLR framework. 
10

Our failure to comply with applicable capital adequacy guidelines could lead to limitations on our business and operations, including limitations on our ability to engage in expansionary activities such as mergers and acquisitions and the establishment of new branch officers, as well as mandatory or discretionary actions by our regulators that could have a direct material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991
Federal law and regulations establish a capital-based regulatory framework designed to promote early intervention (or “prompt corrective action”) for troubled banks. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”) requires federal banking regulators to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to FDIC-insured depository institutions that do not meet certain minimum capital requirements. FDICIA established five capital categories: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” and “critically undercapitalized.” Under currently applicable prompt corrective action regulations, an FDIC-insured depository institution is considered to be well capitalized if (i) it maintains a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of no less than 5%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of no less than 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of no less than 8%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of no less than 10% percent and (ii) it is not subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. An FDIC-insured depository institution generally is considered to be adequately capitalized if it maintains a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 4%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 4.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%. An FDIC-insured depository institution is considered to be undercapitalized if it has a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of less than 4%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, or a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8%. An FDIC-insured depository institution is defined to be significantly undercapitalized if it has a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of less than 3%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4%, or a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%. An institution is considered critically undercapitalized if it fails to maintain tangible equity to total assets of greater than 2%. An insured depository institution may be deemed to be in a capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its actual capital position if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating.
A qualifying community banking organization that has opted into the CBLR framework and maintains a CBLR greater than 9% will generally be considered “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action regulations. If a qualifying community banking organization that has opted into the CBLR framework subsequently fails to satisfy one or more of the CBLR criteria but continues to report a CBLR of greater than 8%, the organization can continue to use the CBLR framework and be deemed to meet the ‘‘well capitalized’’ capital ratio requirements for a grace period of up to two quarters. An organization that is unable to restore compliance with all qualifying criteria during the two-quarter grace period (including coming into compliance with the greater than 9% leverage ratio requirement) or that reports a leverage ratio of 8% or less would be subject to the generally applicable prompt corrective action capital requirements. As mentioned above, we have not opted into the CBLR framework. 
Federal banking regulators are required to take various mandatory supervisory actions, and are authorized to take other discretionary actions, with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories. The severity of the action taken depends upon the capital category in which an institution is placed. 
FDICIA generally prohibits an FDIC-insured depository institution from making any capital distributions (including dividend payments) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution is or would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized depository institutions are required to submit capital restoration plans guaranteed by their holding companies (as applicable), are subject to limitations on asset growth, and are subject to limitations on acquisitions, branching, and engaging in new lines of business. Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions (as well as undercapitalized institutions that fail to submit or implement an acceptable capital plan) are subject to a number of increasingly more stringent requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient stock to become adequately capitalized, limitations on the interest rates paid on deposits, mandates to alter, reduce, or terminate activities determined to pose excessive risk, prohibitions on accepting deposits from correspondent depository institutions, and limitations on compensation paid to senior executive officers (in addition to the requirements and restrictions applicable to undercapitalized institutions). Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator. 
Additionally, an insured depository institution that is adequately capitalized may not accept, renew, or roll over brokered deposit unless it has applied for and been granted a waiver and, even if granted a waived, the institution may not pay an effective yield on any such deposits which exceeds certain regulatory established benchmarks by more than 75 basis points. An undercapitalized institution may not accept, renew, or roll over brokered deposits. 
11

The capital-based prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA and their implementing regulations apply to FDIC-insured depository institutions and are not directly applicable to companies that control those institutions. However, the Federal Reserve has indicated that, in regulating bank and financial holding companies, it will take appropriate action at the holding company level based on an assessment of the effectiveness of supervisory actions imposed upon subsidiary depository institutions pursuant to these provisions and regulations.
Federal Deposit Insurance 
Reliant Bank’s deposits are insured up to prescribed statutory limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. The standard deposit insurance coverage limit is $250,000 per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, per ownership category. 
The Bank is subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. In this regard, the Bank is required to remit quarterly deposit insurance premiums to the FDIC. Insurance premiums for each insured depository institution are determined based upon the institution’s capital level and supervisory rating provided to the FDIC by the institution’s primary federal regulator and other information the FDIC determines to be relevant to the risk posed to the Deposit Insurance Fund by the institution. The assessment rate determined by considering such information is then applied to the amount of the insured depository institution’s average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity during the assessment period to determine the insured depository institution’s insurance premiums. An increase in the Bank’s assessment rate could have a material and adverse effect on our earnings, depending on the amount of the increase. The FDIC may also impose special assessments in emergency situations.
The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if the FDIC finds that the institution has engaged in or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC or any other regulatory agency. The termination of the Bank’s deposit insurance would have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Community Reinvestment Act
The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended (the “CRA”), requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas consistent with safe and sound banking practices. Under the CRA, each depository institution is required to help meet the credit needs of its market areas by, among other things, providing credit or other financial assistance to low-income and moderate-income individuals and communities. Depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance with the CRA and are assigned ratings, which ratings are made publicly available by the federal banking agencies. A bank’s CRA performance is also considered by federal banking agencies in evaluating applications seeking approval for things such as mergers, acquisitions, and new branch facilities. Reliant Bank’s CRA performance is evaluated by the Federal Reserve. The Bank’s most recent CRA performance evaluation was in October 2016, and Reliant Bank received an overall rating of “Satisfactory.” Reliant Bank’s failure to fulfill its obligations under the CRA could prohibit or delay us from engaging in expansionary activities or result in regulatory restrictions or conditions being imposed in connection with those activities. 
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”), enacted in 1999, expanded the universe of activities in which bank holding companies and affiliates of banks are permitted to engage. GLBA eliminated many historical barriers to affiliations among banks and securities firms, insurance companies, and other financial service providers. Under GLBA, a bank holding company which has elected to become a financial holding company, like Reliant Bancorp has done, is able to engage in an expanded range of activities that are financial in nature, incidental to a financial activity, or complementary to a financial activity, subject in certain instances to prior Federal Reserve approval.
Additionally, pursuant to GLBA, federal banking regulators have adopted regulations limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic consumer information to non-affiliated third parties. The regulations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. Under GLBA and its implementing regulations, banks and other financial institutions are required to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information. Pursuant to GLBA and certain state laws, financial institutions are required to notify customers of security breaches resulting in unauthorized access to their personal information.

Bank Secrecy Act and USA PATRIOT Act
The Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970, better known as the Bank Secrecy Act (the “BSA”), requires all United States financial institutions to assist United States government agencies to detect and prevent money laundering. Specifically, the BSA requires financial institutions to (i) keep records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments; (ii) file reports of cash transactions exceeding a daily aggregate amount of $10,000; (iii) report suspicious activity that might signify money laundering, tax evasion, or other criminal activities; and (iv) obtain and retain information regarding the identify and verification of the beneficial owners of business customers.
The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the “USA PATRIOT Act”) substantially broadened existing anti-money laundering legislation and the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the United States, imposed new compliance and due diligence obligations, defined new crimes and penalties, compelled the production of documents located both inside and outside the United States, including those of foreign institutions that have a correspondent relationship in the United States, and clarified the safe harbor from civil liability to customers. The United States Treasury Department has issued a number of regulations implementing the USA PATRIOT Act that apply certain of its requirements to financial institutions such as Reliant Bank. The regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing.
Under the USA PATRIOT Act, all “financial institutions” (as therein defined) must establish anti-money laundering compliance and due diligence programs. Such programs must include, among other things, adequate policies, the designation of a compliance officer, employee and director training programs, an independent audit function to review and test the program, and the ongoing due diligence and monitoring of customer relationships including the beneficial owners of business customers.
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010
In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law bringing about numerous financial institution regulatory reforms. Many of these reforms were implemented between 2011 and 2014 through regulations promulgated by banking and securities regulators. The following discussion describes certain material elements of the regulatory framework. Many of the Dodd-Frank Act provisions are stated to only apply to larger financial institutions and do not directly impact community-based institutions like Reliant Bank. For instance, provisions that regulate derivative transactions and limit derivatives trading activity of federally-insured institutions, enhance supervision of “systemically significant” institutions, impose new regulatory authority over hedge funds, limit proprietary trading by banks, and phase-out the eligibility of trust preferred securities for Tier 1 capital are among the provisions that do not directly impact Reliant Bank either because of exemptions for institutions below a certain asset size or because of the nature of the bank’s operations. Other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that impact Reliant Bank include provisions that:
•Changed the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible capital, eliminated the ceiling for and increased the floor of the Deposit Insurance Fund, and offset the impact of the increase in the floor on institutions with less than $10 billion in assets.
•Made permanent the $250,000 limit for federal deposit insurance.
•Repealed the federal prohibition on payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts.
•Centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, also known as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), responsible for implementing federal consumer protection laws, although banks below $10 billion in assets continue to be examined and supervised for compliance with these laws by their primary federal bank regulator.
•Restricted the preemption of state law by federal law and disallowed national bank subsidiaries from availing themselves of such preemption.
•Imposed new requirements for mortgage lending, including new minimum underwriting standards, prohibitions on certain yield-spread compensation to mortgage originators, special consumer protections for mortgage loans that do not meet certain qualifications, prohibitions, and limitations on certain mortgage terms, and various new mandated disclosures to mortgage borrowers.
13

•Made applicable to certain bank and financial holding companies (currently, generally, those with $3 billion or more in total consolidated assets) the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions.
•Permit national and state banks to establish de novo interstate branches at any location where a bank based in that state could establish a branch and require that bank and financial holding companies and banks be well-capitalized and well managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state.
•Imposed new limits on affiliated transactions and cause derivative transactions to be subject to lending limits.
•Implemented corporate governance revisions, including with regard to executive compensation and proxy access to shareholders, that apply to all public companies, not just financial institutions.
The Dodd-Frank Act has increased the regulatory burden, compliance costs, and non-interest expense for community banks. Of particular concern to many community banks is the breadth of the powers of the CFPB, which may have significant impacts on consumer compliance regulation resulting in increased regulatory compliance costs, particularly for smaller depository institutions.
Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act
The Regulatory Relief Act was enacted in 2018 to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations, including some of those implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act. While it maintained the majority of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Regulatory Relief Act amended certain aspects for smaller depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, such as Reliant Bank. Portions of the Regulatory Relief Act address access to mortgage credit; consumer access to credit; protections for veterans, consumers, and homeowners; rules for certain bank or financial holding companies; capital access; and protections for student borrowers. Reliant Bancorp and Reliant Bank have focused and will continue to focus on the implementing rules and guidance for the various provisions in each section of the Regulatory Relief Act that impact their operations and activities.
As discussed above, the Regulatory Relief Act provided for the simplification of the regulatory capital rules for most financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion by establishing the community bank leverage ratio (CBLR) framework. 
The Regulatory Relief Act also expanded the universe of bank holding companies that are permitted to rely on the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement by increasing the size of qualifying bank holding companies that can rely on the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement from $1 billion in total consolidated assets to $3 billion in total consolidated assets. Bank holding companies that qualify for the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement are exempt from consolidated capital requirements, even though their subsidiary depository institutions continue to be subject to capital adequacy guidelines.
Further, the Regulatory Relief Act decreased the burden for community banks in regard to call reports, the Volcker Rule (which generally restricts banks from engaging in certain investment activities and limits involvement with hedge funds and private equity firms), mortgage disclosures, and risk weights for some high-risk commercial real estate loans. On December 28, 2018, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule increasing the asset threshold to qualify for an 18-month examination cycle from $1 billion to $3 billion for qualifying institutions that are well-capitalized, well-managed and meet certain other requirements.
Any number of the provisions of the Regulatory Relief Act may have the effect of increasing our expenses, decreasing our revenues, or changing the activities in which we choose to engage. The environment in which financial institutions operate, including legislative and regulatory changes affecting capital, liquidity, supervision, permissible activities, corporate governance and compensation, changes in fiscal policy and steps to eliminate government support for financial institutions, may have long-term effects on the profitability of financial institutions that cannot now be foreseen.
Current Expected Credit Loss
In June 2016, a new accounting standard changing the method for providing for allowances for loan and lease losses was introduced by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. This new standard is commonly referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss standard, or “CECL”. In December 2018, federal banking agencies issued a joint final rule to revise the regulatory capital rules to, among other things, address the upcoming implementation of CECL and provide an optional three-year phase-in period for the day-one adverse regulatory capital effects that banking organizations are expected to experience upon adopting CECL. 
14

CECL is currently scheduled to become effective for Reliant Bank in 2023. The use of this standard will increase the types of data required to determine the appropriate level of Reliant Bank’s allowance for loan and lease losses. The use of this standard may potentially increase Reliant Bank’s allowance for loan and lease losses. Any increase in Reliant Bank’s allowance for loan and lease losses or expenses incurred in order to make the determination for such allowance could have a material and adverse effect on Reliant Bank’s financial condition and results of operations. The direct effects of CECL on Reliant Bank are not yet known.
Other Laws and Regulations
Loan interest and other charges that Reliant Bank collects or contracts for are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Reliant Bank’s loan operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as:
•The federal Truth-In-Lending Act, which governs disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
•The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, which requires financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligations to help meet the housing needs of the communities it serves;
•The Equal Credit Opportunity Act, which prohibits discrimination in extending credit on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or other prohibited factors;
•The Fair Credit Reporting Act, which governs the use of consumer credit information and the provision of information to credit reporting agencies;
•The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which governs debt collection practices; and
•The rules and regulations of the various governmental agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these federal laws.
In addition, Reliant Bank’s deposit operations are subject to the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E issued by the Federal Reserve to implement that act, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services.
Effects of Governmental Policies
Reliant Bank’s earnings are affected by the difference between the interest earned by Reliant Bank on its loans and investments and the interest paid by Reliant Bank on its deposits or other borrowings. The yields on its assets and the rates paid on its liabilities are sensitive to changes in prevailing market rates of interest. Thus, the earnings and growth of Reliant Bank are influenced by general economic conditions, fiscal policies of the federal government, and the policies of regulatory agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve, which establishes national monetary policy. The nature and impact of any future changes in fiscal or monetary policies cannot be predicted.
Commercial banks such as Reliant Bank are affected by the credit policy of various regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve to implement its objectives are open market operations in United States Government securities, changes in reserve requirements on bank deposits, changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings and limitations on interest rates that banks may pay on time and savings deposits. The Federal Reserve uses these instruments in varying combinations to influence the overall growth of bank loans, investments and deposits, and also to affect interest rates charged on loans, received on investments or paid for deposits.
The monetary and fiscal policies of regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve, also affect the banking industry. Through changes in the reserve requirements against bank deposits, open market operations in United States Government securities and changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings, the Federal Reserve influences the cost and availability of funds obtained for lending and investing. No prediction can be made with respect to possible future changes in interest rates, deposit levels or loan demand or with respect to the impact of such changes on the business and earnings of Reliant Bank.

Future Legislation and Regulation 
Various and significant legislation affecting financial institutions and the financial industry is from time to time introduced in the United States Congress, as evidenced by the sweeping reforms in the Dodd-Frank Act, and the subsequent rollback of portions of the Dodd-Frank Act that began in 2018. Many of the regulations mentioned above were adopted or amended pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. Additional legislation may create new, or continue to change existing, banking statutes and regulations, and may alter the operating environment of Reliant and its subsidiaries, particularly Reliant Bank, in significant and unpredictable ways, and such legislation could significantly increase or decrease our cost of doing business, limit or expand the permissible activities in which we can engage, and/or affect the competitive balance among financial institutions. Current and future political and economic conditions and uncertainty makes the nature and extent of future legislative and regulatory changes affecting financial institutions unpredictable.
