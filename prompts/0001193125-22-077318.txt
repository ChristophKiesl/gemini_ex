Introductory Note 
 The following describes the business of Austerlitz Acquisition Corporation I. Except where otherwise noted, all references to “we,” “us,” “our,” “Austerlitz I,” or the “Company,” are to Austerlitz Acquisition Corporation I. 
Company History and Description of Business 
 The Company was incorporated as a Cayman Island exempted company on December 21, 2020. The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses that the Company has not yet identified (the “Business Combination” or an initial business combination). The Company’s sponsor is Austerlitz Acquisition Sponsor, LP I (the “Sponsor”). 
 On March 2, 2021, the Company consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO” or “Initial Public Offering”) of 69,000,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units, the “Public Shares” and with respect to the warrants included in the Units sold the “Public Warrants”), including 9,000,000 Units sold pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional Units to cover over- allotments. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $690,000,000. 
 Substantially concurrently with the closing of the IPO, the Company completed a private sale of an aggregate 10,533,333 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”, and together with the Public Warrants, the “Warrants”) at a purchase price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant (the “Private Placement”) to the Sponsor, generating aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $15,800,000. 
 Following the closing of the IPO and Private Placement on March 2, 2021, an amount of $690,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit) of the proceeds from the IPO were placed in a U.S.-based, non-interest-bearing trust account at JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, acting as trustee (the “Trust Account”). Except with respect to interest earned on the funds in the Trust Account, if any, that may be released to the Company to pay its franchise and income taxes and expenses relating to the administration of the trust account, the proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement held in the Trust Account will not be released until the earliest of (a) the completion of a Business Combination, (b) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of its obligation to redeem 100% of its public shares if the Company does not complete its initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO or (ii) with respect to any other provisions relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, and (c) the redemption of all of the Company’s public shares if it is unable to complete its business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO, subject to applicable law. 
 The Company’s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. The Company must complete its initial Business Combination with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (excluding any deferred underwriting commissions held in the Trust Account) at the time the Company signs a definitive agreement in connection with a Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 
 The forgoing is a summary of the Company’s history and general business purpose. For a complete discussion of the development of the Company’s business refer to the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-252932) filed with the SEC on February 22, 2021 (the “IPO Prospectus”), which is incorporated by reference herein. The following is a discussion of the updates to our development of business subsequent to the date of our IPO Prospectus.

  WIL Business Combination 
 On May 10, 2021, the Company entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”) with Wave Merger Sub Limited, an exempted company limited by shares incorporated in Bermuda and a direct and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), and Wynn Interactive Ltd., an exempted company limited by shares incorporated in Bermuda (“WIL”). 
 The Business Combination Agreement provided for, among other things, the consummation of the following transactions (the “WIL Business Combination”): (i) the Company would transfer by way of continuation from the Cayman Islands to Bermuda and register as an exempted company limited by shares, at which time the Company would change its name to “Wynn Interactive Limited”; and (ii) Merger Sub would merge with and into WIL (the “Merger”), with WIL being the surviving company of the Merger. 
 In connection with the signing of the Business Combination Agreement, the Company and Cannae Holdings, Inc. (“Cannae”), an affiliate of the Sponsor, entered into a Backstop Facility Agreement (the “Backstop Agreement”) whereby Cannae agreed, subject to the other terms and conditions included therein, at the BPS Closing (as defined in the Backstop Agreement), to subscribe for the Company’s Class A ordinary shares in order to fund redemptions by shareholders of the Company in connection with the Pending Business Combination, in an amount of up to $690,000,000 (the “Cannae Subscription”), in consideration for a placement fee of $3,450,000 (the “Backstop Placement Fee”). The Backstop Agreement was contingent on the closing of the WIL Business Combination. 
 In connection with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement and the Backstop Agreement, the Company amended and restated (a) that certain letter agreement (the “Sponsor Agreement”), dated March 2, 2021, between the Company and Austerlitz Capital AU, LP I (the “Sponsor”) and (b) that certain letter agreement, dated as of March 2, 2021, by and between the Company and each of the Sponsor and the directors and officers of the Company (the “Insiders”) and entered into that certain amended and restated sponsor agreement (the “Amended and Restated Sponsor Agreement”) with the Sponsor, Cannae and the Insiders. 
 In connection with the signing of the Business Combination Agreement, the Company and Cannae entered into a mutual termination agreement to terminate that certain forward purchase agreement dated as of February 25, 2021, pursuant to which Cannae had agreed to purchase 5,000,000 Class A ordinary shares of the Company and 1,250,000 warrants. 
 On November 11, 2021, the Company entered into a mutual termination agreement (the “Mutual Termination Agreement”) to terminate the Business Combination Agreement. In conjunction with the Mutual Termination Agreement, the Company received $5,000,000 as reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses (the “WIL Expense Reimbursement”). As a result of the termination of the Business Combination Agreement, the Backstop Agreement and the Amended and Restated Sponsor Agreement were automatically terminated.
