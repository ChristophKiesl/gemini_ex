Overview
PagerDuty is a digital operations management platform that empowers the right action, when seconds matter. 
Our platform, which includes our auto remediation software, is the best way to manage urgent, mission-critical work—and keep digital services always on. It sits at the center of a company’s digital ecosystem ingesting signals and using machine learning and automation to prevent and automate real time work, predict and avoid downtime. We enable teams to reduce outages, improve productivity and accelerate digital transformations. 
We collect data from virtually any software-enabled system or device and combine it with human response data correlating and processing it to understand digital opportunities and issues that need to be addressed in real-time. Using the world’s broadest integrations, event management, automated remediation and diagnostics, and human driven runbook automation, we bring together the right people with the right information so they can resolve issues and act on opportunities in minutes and seconds, not hours, days or even weeks like legacy solutions.
Companies across nearly every industry are undergoing digital transformation in response to their customers’ shift to digital channels. This drives strategic imperatives for our customers: digital acceleration, cloud migration, and DevOps transformation. Our digital operations platform empowers customers across verticals and geographies as they tackle these imperatives by cutting through complexity, redundant work, and providing new ways of delivering differentiated digital services. As companies’ digital operations become more complex, growing to comprise hundreds or thousands of interrelated services—both in the cloud and on-premise—executing on the promise of digital transformation is becoming increasingly challenging. Consumers have become used to bespoke experiences in real-time. They want to have food delivered to their home from the restaurant of their choice within an hour; stream a movie of their choice on an iPhone while waiting in line at the airport; or do their holiday shopping from the couch with a few clicks. Delivering a great digital experience, free from slowdowns and outages, is an imperative because anything less than a perfect experience can result in lost revenue, customer churn, reduced productivity, and reputational damage. PagerDuty’s platform empowers our customers to handle this critical real time work as they embrace the necessities of digital acceleration, cloud migration and DevOps transformation to meet their customers where they are.
PagerDuty was founded to support the DevOps movement by breaking down silos between technical teams, like developers and operators, enabling a culture of accountability and collaboration. Our platform’s initial focus was on the software developers who are the owners and architects of the customers’ digital experience and enterprises’ digital transformation. To drive trials and earn trust within the developer community, PagerDuty’s platform is designed to find, adopt, and scale with a rapid return on investment for the user and the company. We embrace agile methodology and the DevOps culture of empathy, autonomy, trust, and continuous innovation. Through this mindset, we seek to improve the lives of our users by designing our product from the ground up for real-time, business critical work. We do this by providing smarter workflows, improved automation, collaboration tools, and continuous learning through advanced analytics. 
Since our founding in 2009, we have expanded our capabilities from a single product focused on on-call management for technical teams to one that serves many roles across the company, delivering a real time source of truth to security, customer service, and executive stakeholders alike. Growing from an on-call tool into a full digital operations management platform, spanning incident response, on-call management, business visibility, advanced analytics, and AI Ops capabilities across automation and event management to reduce the noise, interruptions and redundant tasks from our customer’s lives. We have invested in developing the scalability, reliability, and security of our platform, allowing us to address the needs of even the largest and most demanding customers. We have spent years building deep product integrations to our platform, and our ecosystem now includes over 500 direct integrations to enable our customers to gather and correlate digital signals from virtually any software-enabled system or device. Those same integrations allow PagerDuty to connect with popular collaboration tools and business applications as well as all types of technology stacks to drive automation of work.
We generate revenue primarily from cloud-hosted subscription fees with the majority of our revenue from such arrangements. We offer a three-tiered range of pricing plans aligned with our customers’ needs and the sophistication of their digital operations. In addition, our Rundeck automation offering is available on a subscription basis. We also offer a “freemium” plan for less than five users to introduce new users to the platform. We have a land-and-expand business model that leads to viral adoption of our products and subsequent expansion. Our online self-service model is the primary mechanism for landing new customers and enabling teams to get started without assistance. We complement our self-service model with high-velocity inside sales focused on small and medium businesses, a commercial team focused on mid-market customers, and a field sales team focused on enterprise customers. Our mid-market and enterprise customers account for the majority of our revenue today. These teams drive expansion to additional users, additional teams, and new use cases, as well as upsell premium functionality.
Our business has experienced rapid growth since our inception. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020, our revenue was $213.6 million and $166.4 million, respectively. We continue to invest in our business and had a net loss of $68.9 million and $50.3 million, for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
How Our Platform Works
Our platform sits at the heart of a company’s technology ecosystem, combining the power of machine automation with human action to mobilize teams of experts, particularly across DevOps, ITOps and customer service representatives, who work together in real-time to deliver, maintain, optimize, and fix problems with critical digital services in minutes and seconds. Our platform incorporates AI and machine learning capabilities that help predict and automate prevention of issues, while also offloading any menial, repetitive tasks, to direct the more time sensitive mission critical work to the right people for the job. Thanks to our secure, reliable platform, the teams who use PagerDuty spend less time on frustrating tasks and toil—and more time focused on creating new and better digital experiences. The graphic below illustrates how our platform works. 
PagerDuty ingests signals in real time across our customers digital ecosystem and instantaneously correlates across them and decides which signals require action. We then assess three possible paths for remediation.
•Machine Automation. For incidents that do not require human intervention, PagerDuty uses auto-remediation to eliminate the manual toil of incident response so teams can spend less time reacting and more time on valuable tasks that improve customer experience. We run diagnostics and trigger remediation sequences in order to avoid the need to interrupt skilled workers if possible. These diagnostics include steps normally managed by humans, such as restarting servers and ramping CPU capacity, among other diagnostics. 
•Team Mobilization. Once an incident or potential incident is identified, if required, we manage the process of bringing together the responsible team members across DevOps, ITOps, Customer Support 
and Service, and other business functions, to inform on and resolve the incident before it can impact customers. We provide teams with pre-gathered rich contextual information about the incident so they can take the right action in real time. We provide our capabilities natively, or within the tools that teams work in, promoting a “work where you are” environment whether that is in common applications such as Slack, Teams or Zoom, or more technical environments. We engage teams using their preferred communication channels, with notifications via email, SMS, voice, and push notifications to ensure the most rapid acknowledgement of issues and reducing critical time to resolve. 
•Combine Machine Automation and Team Mobilization. PagerDuty combines machine automation technology with team mobilization to serve up a proposed automation routine to the right responder, with the option to initiate it with the click of a button. PagerDuty is the only company to combine machine automation and team mobilization, in response to real-time, mission critical workflow. This enables tier one responders with easy press-button automation of powerful remediation steps to cut critical minutes out of outages and incidents.
The center of our customers digital ecosystems
PagerDuty ingests and contextualizes signals to filter out noise and then mobilizes the appropriate response, whether it is automated or a human response. Our approach helps us aggregate related signals into an incident that teams can act on. When these digital signals require teams to respond, it’s supported where your responders live, in tools like Slack, Teams and Zoom, and via bi-directional integrations to your ITSM tools. We also provide technology leaders, technical responders, and business owners a shared, real-time view into the business impact of an incident.
PagerDuty empowers the full ROI of our customers’ tool stack, using machine learning, automation, auto-remediation, and self-healing to bring together the right people with the right information to generate the appropriate action, in real time, when seconds matter.
Technology Differentiators of Our Platform
We have invested aggressively in research and development to build innovative products that deliver value to our customers. Our cloud-native platform is differentiated based on a broad range of attributes:
•Built for real time. Our platform manages today’s complex and contemporary digital services. These are microservice based environments that are constantly changing state. That requires managing the 
entire service lifecycle from collecting data, interpreting digital signals, orchestrating a response when needed, and providing insights—all in real time. There is no concept of queued tickets or queued work in our platform because we are built to understand these situations and solve incidents within seconds or minutes, not hours or days. 
•Nearly 12 years’ of data from over 13,500 customers. As pioneers in digital operations management, we have a rich repository of machine-generated data and human response data. We utilize our data from every incident and leverage it across our platform, allowing us to build advanced machine-learning capabilities, provide richer contextual insights to teams, and share in-depth analytics, benchmarking, and best practices with our customers. We combine machine and human response data with business metrics to provide users visibility into the real-time business impact of incidents.
•Over 500 integrations across the technology ecosystem. We have invested extensively in an ecosystem that includes over 500 integrations, allowing us to harness data from software-enabled systems and devices. We have deep integrations to a range of widely-used technologies, such as AWS, Datadog, HashiCorp, New Relic, and Splunk, and bi-directional integrations into Atlassian, Microsoft VSTS, Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Slack. Our integrations support a broad range of use cases including developers, IT, security, support, and other business functions. We provide capabilities through which our users can easily build integrations themselves and connect our products with other third-party technologies.
•Breadth of functionality. We provide our customers with a complete platform that spans end-to-end digital operations management needs: harness digital data, make sense of data, respond and engage teams, and analyze and learn from a team’s actions. We have continued to extend our core capabilities around on-call management and modern incident response to include event intelligence and business visibility. We have embedded machine learning, automation, insights, and best practices across our products to help our customers realize value quickly.
•Proactive. We are leading a shift from efficient response to proactive and predictive action to help teams prevent incidents from occurring.
•Secure, resilient, and scalable. Our customers depend on us for their digital operations needs. When their systems fail, we need to be operational. We have built multiple redundancies into our infrastructure including multiple cloud regions, communications network, and a single DNS provider from a leading cloud provider. We run entirely in production, with no maintenance windows, so our customers can rely on always-on delivery. We have delivered 99.99% uptime to our customers over the past 24 months. Security is a critical customer requirement, and we have adopted governance, access control, and vulnerability testing to support the needs of our most sophisticated customers.
•Designed for the user. Our software is easy to adopt and use. We provide a simple, self-service onboarding experience so teams can be up and running in minutes. Our products are mobile-first and include intuitive navigation. Customers can easily extend our platform across teams and multiple use cases within an organization.
•Technology agnostic. We are agnostic to our customer’s technology stack and provide them the choice to use best-of-breed technologies that meet their needs. We are flexible, modular, and open in our approach to building our platform and a powerful and broad featured API to enable rapid integrations into even the most complex environments. Our open technology and broad range of integrations ensures that we can effectively co-exist with our customer’s technology.
Our Growth Strategies
•Land new customers across enterprises of all sizes. We will continue to target new customers by leveraging our trusted brand and highly efficient go-to-market strategy that combines self-serve viral adoption with a focused direct sales effort. We will continue to build on our partner ecosystem to drive 
awareness and adoption of our products. We will continue to target our potential customers with community building and marketing programs that include digital campaigns, our annual user conference, broader industry events, customer marketing activities, and user meet-ups.
•Expand usage within our existing customer base across development, IT operations and security operations user groups, as well as with new user groups such as customer service and support. Development and IT professionals often make an initial purchase of our platform for a small number of users and then expand users over time. We will continue to work with customers to demonstrate how additional users can help accelerate organizational benefits. We see significant growth opportunities within the development and IT operations, security operations, and customer service and support communities and estimate that we have penetrated less than 1% within this group of professionals. We intend to increase our inside and field sales and customer success efforts as well as leverage partners to continue to drive adoption across our existing customers.
•Introduce new products and functionality. Our ability to develop innovative capabilities and introduce new products has been integral to our success and we will continue to invest in our platform to deliver greater value to our customers. We will continue to make investments in research and development to bolster our existing products, increase the reach of our integrations, and innovate on our platform, particularly around event intelligence and AIOps, automation, business visibility, analytics, and the application ecosystem. Our expanding portfolio of products provides us additional opportunities to upsell and cross-sell into our customer base. In addition to internal development, we can expand our product portfolio and offerings through acquisitions.
•Grow our international presence. We have a large and global customer base that is passionate about our product. We intend to build on our success to date and grow our sales outside North America. The self-service, low friction nature of our offering allows us to easily expand our reach into other regions where we see significant opportunity. We intend to grow our presence in international markets in order to accelerate new customer acquisition and existing customer expansion, particularly throughout EMEA and Asia Pacific and Japan. Our international operations generated 24% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.
•Expand use cases across all teams and business stakeholders. We believe that there is a large opportunity for organizations to expand adoption beyond development and IT operations to additional use cases such as customer service and support, security operations, business operations, and industrial operations. We intend to enable and encourage our customer base to further promote the extensibility of our products to address additional use cases. We will continue to invest in our product and ecosystem to build rich capabilities to support expansion of use cases. 
Our Market Opportunity
Every business across every industry is undergoing digital transformation. We believe our platform addresses any team member who is associated with the development, delivery, and operations of the digital experience. Our platform has demonstrated core use cases across development, IT operations, customer service and support and security operations. We estimate that in 2021, there are approximately 72 million potential users worldwide in the development, IT operations, customer service and support, and security operations segments, comprised of: 
•22.0 million development personnel
•20.8 million IT operations personnel
•27.4 million customer service and support personnel
•1.6 million security operations personnel
We estimate our total addressable market is over $25 billion. To calculate our total addressable market, we multiply our estimate of 72 million potential users by our average revenue per user, including our new products such 
as Digital Operations and Rundeck. We currently have less than 1% penetration within these markets. In addition to our core use cases, we are seeing our customers use our platform across their business operations and industrial operations. We cannot assure you that the average revenue per user can be realized across our total addressable market of potential users.
Delivering on our promise of digital transformation is a top priority for companies as they fight to stay relevant to their customers. We believe spending on development, IT operations, customer service and support, and security operations will increasingly shift toward processes that enable digital transformation, including digital operations management.
PagerDuty Platform for Digital Operations Management
The PagerDuty platform empowers teams to take action in real time by combining machine-generated data with human response data. Our platform provides comprehensive capabilities across on-call management, event intelligence, incident response, business visibility, and advanced analytics to address broader digital operations management requirements.
PagerDuty On-Call Management
PagerDuty On-Call Management provides teams with the ability to effectively automate the process of identifying, triaging, managing incidents, and orchestrating the response. Key capabilities include self-service scheduling, incident management, dynamic notifications across channels, and automated escalations.

Recommendations drives quick and confident decisions to improve operational maturity. Operational report cards lets organizations review the impact of incidents and align leaders to drive improvements at every level. Analytics can also be embedded into Slack, right where you work to help avoid context switching, making analytics part of daily routines.
Our Technology
Our platform is built on a modern modular technology stack that is scalable, resilient and secure. The key characteristics of our platform include:
Open and Extensible Technology Platform
Our cloud-native products are built on a common core platform that allows us to both rapidly develop new features and to expose APIs for our customers to use. We strive to make these APIs as full-featured as possible. This allows us to build native integrations with other software products to make our offering more comprehensive out-of-the-box. For needs that go beyond our core offering and native extensions, we also offer a broad set of APIs that allow our customers the ability to build their own applications on top of our extensible platform.
Scalable and Reliable Infrastructure
Our platform was designed from the ground up for scalability and reliability to address the requirements for the most demanding and innovative organizations. Scalability can take multiple forms—growth from new customers signing up to use the platform and existing customers expanding their use of PagerDuty, as well as spikes in traffic from large-scale incidents.
Since our infrastructure is cloud-native, we are able to provision new capacity rapidly in order to accommodate growth. We are built to be an “always on” service with redundancy and security designed into our platform. We update software without downtime, with gates to validate expected behavior and quickly roll back if those expectations are not met. We rely on multiple third-party providers for critical infrastructure functionality; if one service is not responsive, we can automatically reroute to another.
Enterprise-grade Security
Security is a mission-critical requirement and concern for every organization. Our customers frequently use our platform to store and manage highly sensitive or proprietary information. Our approach to security includes data governance as well as ongoing testing for potential security issues. We have robust access controls in our production environment with access to data strictly assigned, monitored, and audited. To ensure our controls remain up to date, we undergo continuous third-party testing for vulnerabilities within our software architecture.
Our Customers
Our platform and go-to-market strategy are designed to enable organizations of all sizes and maturity levels to benefit from our platform. We provide our products through a highly modular approach that gives customers the flexibility to adopt products that fit the needs of their teams and organizations at any stage of operations maturity or size. 
As of January 31, 2021, we had a global customer base of over 13,500 customers of all sizes across a broad variety of industries, including more than one-third of the Fortune 500. No single customer represented 10% or more of our revenue for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.
Customer Success
We are committed to the success of our customers. This means delivering performance improvements that enable our customers to drive their cloud migration, DevOps Transformation, and Digital Acceleration. The key to delivering recurring value is rapid implementation with a focus on continuous improvement throughout our relationship. We assist our customers by expanding their ability to operate in real-time via cross functional workflows in engineering, IT, security, customer support, executive leadership, and across their entire employee base.
The Customer Success team is structured to provide expertise through the entire customer lifecycle from onboarding, adoption of our platform, business value realization and renewal. We provide in-depth instructor-led courses to certify our customers and partners on products, technology, and best practices. The support teams respond to our customers’ queries related to our products via a multi-channel environment from no-fee to paid 24/7 support with service level agreements. Technical industry experts, architects, and consultants assist customers with rapid deployment with workflow optimization and PagerDuty best practices. The renewals team works proactively to reduce churn/downgrade and provide customers with a positive on-time renewal experience.
In addition, we provide a range of self-service capabilities including a comprehensive online repository for information around technical documentation, integration guides, training videos, an online forum for our customers to ask questions and get answers from the broader community, and best practices around key topics such as incident response and APIs for application integration are open sourced and accessible to everyone.
Research and Development
Our research and development team consists of our user experience, product management, and engineering teams and technical operations. These groups are responsible for the design, development, testing, and delivery of new technologies and features for our platform. They are also responsible for scaling our platform and maintaining our cloud infrastructure. We invest substantial resources in research and development to drive core technology innovation and bring new products to market. We are early adopters and thought leaders in agile development, DevOps culture, and site reliability engineering, empowering our engineers with full-service ownership of their code in production, leading to high-quality software. Our distributed research and development efforts enable us to attract the best talent across our multiple locations, including San Francisco, Atlanta, Seattle, Toronto, London, and Sydney.
Sales
We employ a highly efficient go-to-market strategy that combines viral adoption through word of mouth, user-centric content marketing, and grass roots brand development with a high-velocity inside sales model that drives both the initial land of new customers and the subsequent expansion into broader use cases, increased users, 
and premium functionality. We also target senior IT and business operations management at companies from mid-market to the largest enterprises through inside and field sales strategies to pursue larger-scale deployments.
Our global sales teams focus on both new customer acquisition and up-selling and cross-selling additional products to our existing customers. Our sales teams are organized by geography, consisting of the Americas, EMEA, Asia Pacific, and Japan, as well as by target organization size.
Marketing
We focus our marketing efforts on the strength of our product innovation, the value we provide and our domain expertise. Our model is driven by a land and expand approach. We employ a highly efficient digital marketing strategy that drives the majority of our new customer acquisition. We use a combination of digital and field marketing tactics to drive expansion by increasing users, new product adoption, and broader or new use cases. 
Our marketing team focuses on brand building, awareness, and demand generation through campaigns that leverage our content, technical resources, thought leadership, and customer stories. We rely on multiple marketing and sales automation tools to efficiently market to, and automatically identify qualified individuals using product and industry specific criteria.
We use diverse marketing tactics to engage with prospective customers including email marketing, event marketing, digital advertising, social media, public relations, and community initiatives. We also host and present at regional, national, and global events, including our PagerDuty Summit, to engage both customers and prospects, deliver product training, share best practices, and foster community. Our technical leaders and evangelists frequently speak as subject matter experts at market-leading developer events like DevOps Days.
Competition
The market for digital operations management is nascent, fragmented, and constantly evolving. We primarily compete against manual processes, in-house solutions, and software providers that may compete against certain components of our offering. Our primary competitors include Atlassian OpsGenie and Splunk On-Call (formerly VictorOps).
We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including:
•platform functionality and breadth of offering;
•integrations;
•performance, security, scalability, and reliability;
•real-time response, workflow, and automation capabilities;
•focus on modern, contemporary digital services and operations
•brand recognition, reputation, and customer satisfaction;
•ease of implementation and ease of use, and;
•time-to-value, total cost of ownership, and return on investment.
We believe that we compete favorably with respect to all of these factors and that we are well positioned as a leader in the category of digital operations management.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights, and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. While we had 11 issued patents and six patent applications pending examination in the United States as of January 31, 2021 that with respect to the issued patents 
are expected to have terms ending between 2033 and 2040, and we actively seek patent protection covering inventions originating from our company, we do not believe that we are materially dependent on any one or more of our patents. We pursue the registration of domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the United States and in various jurisdictions outside the United States.
We control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international intellectual property laws. We require our employees, consultants, and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and control access to software, documentation, and other proprietary information. Our policy is to require employees and independent contractors to sign agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments, and other processes generated by them on our behalf and agreeing to protect our confidential information. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our vendors and customers.
Although we rely on intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights, and trademarks, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new modules, features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our platform are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.
Regulatory
We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations may involve privacy, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection, export taxation, or other subjects. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate. Because global laws and regulations have continued to develop and evolve rapidly, it is possible that we may not be, or may not have been, compliant with each such applicable law or regulation. For a discussion of risks related to these various areas of government regulation, see “Risk Factors- We are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations, particularly those related to privacy, data protection and information security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business, by resulting in litigation, fines, penalties or adverse publicity and reputational damage that may negatively affect the value of our business and decrease the price of our common stock. Compliance with such laws could also result in additional costs and liabilities to us or inhibit sales of our solutions.”
Geographic Information
For a description of our revenue and long-lived assets by geographic location, see Note 14, “Geographic Information” of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Human Capital
Our corporate culture is a critical component of our success and we will continue taking steps to help foster innovation, teamwork, diversity, and inclusion. We promote an environment that values the democratization of ideas and the adoption of a DevOps culture internally, resulting in a mindset that is empowering our team to be more innovative, productive, and collaborative. We are continually investing in our global workforce to further drive diversity and inclusion, provide fair and market-competitive pay and benefits to support our employees’ well-being, and foster their growth and development. As of January 31, 2021, we had 783 employees, of which approximately 70% were in the United States and 30% were in our international locations. None of our employees are represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity
At PagerDuty, we seek to enable employees of all backgrounds to be champions, facilitators, and practitioners of Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity (“ID&E”) everywhere. Regardless of identity, it is important that all our employees feel welcome, safe, and heard. Our ID&E mission is to activate the potential of all employees through systemic and programmatic equity, sustainable community development, and life-altering learning experiences. Our ID&E vision is a people-first, data-driven organization where power is equitably distributed across the mosaic of our employees’ identities. 
As we work to meet our diversity goals, it is important that every employee feels accepted, supported, and able to be their authentic self. We do this by creating initiatives to invest in equitable and sustainable communities, which help employees mobilize and take action. Our goal is for PagerDuty to be a people-first organization where opportunity is equitably distributed among all employees. Our Employee Resource Groups (“ERG”)—networks of employees with shared characteristics, interests, and experiences—are a critical element in how we achieve this goal and engage with employees. The ERGs are the cultural backbone of our vibrant community and support our ID&E efforts through education, awareness, and celebration.
Additional information on our diversity and inclusion strategy, diversity metrics and programs can be found on our website at pagerduty.com/careers/diversity/. Nothing on our website shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Compensation, Benefits, and Well Being
We offer fair, competitive compensation and benefits that support our employees’ overall well-being. To ensure alignment with our short- and long-term objectives, our compensation programs employees include base pay, short-term incentives, and opportunities for long-term incentives. We offer a wide array of benefits including comprehensive health and welfare insurance, generous time-off and leave, and retirement support. We provide emotional well-being services through our Employee Assistance Program and a variety of interactive applications.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have temporarily closed all of our offices, transitioned our employees to work remotely, and implemented travel restrictions on all business-related travel. We have extended our paid time off and sick leave benefits for employees directly impacted by COVID-19 or caring for children or a member of their household impacted by COVID-19. In addition, we are providing allowances to our employees to cover expenses related to transitioning to a work from home environment. We also continue to offer local employee assistance programs to employees if needed. In addition, we have added several company-wide paid days off to help employees balance their work and life responsibilities.
Employee Engagement and Development
We invest significant resources to develop our in-house talent and deepen our employees’ skill sets, both to strengthen our company and help further our employees’ personal career goals. We empower our employees to drive their career development and set personal development objectives in partnership with their managers. To strengthen these conversations, we train managers to partner with employees through career conversations so that they can successfully leverage the many tools in place to support them.
In order to ensure we are listening to our employees, we regularly survey our employees to obtain their views and assess employee satisfaction. We use the views expressed in the surveys to influence our people strategy and policies. We also use employee survey information to gain insights into how and where we work.
Social Responsibility and Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Initiatives
We launched PagerDuty.org in 2017 to ensure a sustainable contribution to the communities in which we live, work, and service by integrating social impact and sustainability into our business. PagerDuty.org exists to empower those working to make a difference in the world, and to use our technology to help solve difficult challenges. We do so by mobilizing core company assets—our people and product—to help impact organizations deliver on their mission when every moment matters.
We commit 1% of equity, 1% of product, and 1% of employee time to advance positive community impact through the Pledge 1% movement. In June 2018, we fulfilled our equity pledge by issuing a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock to the Tides Foundation to fund our philanthropic giving. The PagerDuty.org Fund seeks to help save lives by reaching people faster through integrated investments of grants, donated product, and employee expertise in the area of Time-Critical Health. We granted more than $500,000 in 2020 in rapid response funding to support COVID-19 relief (including to the CDC Foundation and World Health Organization COVID Relief Fund) and forward-looking investments to help organizations respond to urgent needs faster to advance health (International Medical Corps, NexLeaf Analytics, and Trek Medics). In 2020, we launched a supporting Just and Equity Communities portfolio with initial investments in voter access and engagement. Our Impact Pricing program provides discounted pricing to nonprofits and social enterprises globally to ensure they can access PagerDuty’s platform for digital operations. We also expanded our volunteer time off policy to support our employees in voting, nonpartisan get out the vote efforts, and peaceful demonstration, and launched new rewards and recognition programs to reward and celebrate our employees for contributing their time and talents.
We made initial investments in ESG in 2020 to ensure that how we operate as a business produces positive impact, conducting an internal assessment with input from a cross-functional ESG Steering Committee and executive support. While many ESG elements are already in place, we identified areas for further development as we build an integrated cross-company ESG strategy in 2021 and complete our first assessment.
Our effort continues through our support for inclusion across the company and the wider technology industry. We have partnered with some of the most promising organizations like Hackbright Academy, Upwardly Global, Path Forward, and Code2020 to improve diversity in our industry and beyond by creating access, offering sponsorship, program advocacy, career coaching, and recruitment opportunities.
To articulate our progress against social impact, equity, and ESG goals and commitments, PagerDuty.org published an inaugural Impact Report. We will track and report annually on our progress against social impact, equity and ESG commitments as we formalize new areas of investment and impact.
