Our Strategy
Growth
As an organization, we are committed to "Total Growth", meaning we strive towards delivering value through organic initiatives, innovations and acquisitions, as well as financial performance. With an emphasis on increasing recurring revenues and expanding our margins, we believe our Total Growth strategy will ultimately drive overall cash flow generation, thus helping to fuel our disciplined capital allocation approach and further our ability to deepen our account coverage and identify and execute strategic acquisitions. With strategic acquisitions, we are well positioned to expand our product portfolio and improve our ability to innovate and grow organically, which helps us to meet our long-term growth targets. We believe this Total Growth strategy is a durable model that will create shareholder value over both the near and long-term.
We are committed to continuous innovation. Our investments in R&D push product innovation, increasing the value of our offerings to our installed customer base, which includes Global 10,000 companies (G10K), SMB and consumers. The G10K are the world's largest companies, typically those with greater than two billion in revenues, as well as the world's largest governments and organizations. More valuable products, coupled with our established global partner program, lead to greater distribution and cross-selling opportunities which further help us to achieve organic growth. Over the last three fiscal years, we have invested a cumulative total of $1.1 billion in R&D or 11.9% of cumulative revenue for that three year period. We target to spend 12% to 14% of revenues for R&D each fiscal year.
The cloud is a business imperative. What used to be discussed as a potential option for managing budgets, is now a strategic direction that drives competitive positioning, product innovation, business agility, operational efficiency and cost management. We are committed to continue our investment in the OpenText Cloud to best suit the needs of our customers. Supported by a global, scalable, and secure infrastructure, the OpenText Cloud includes a foundational platform of technology services, and packaged business applications for industry and business processes. The OpenText Cloud enables organizations to protect and manage information in public, private or hybrid deployments at scale.
We remain a value oriented and disciplined acquirer, having efficiently deployed $6.5 billion on acquisitions over the last 10 fiscal years. Mergers and acquisitions are one of our leading growth drivers. We believe in creating value by focusing on acquiring strategic businesses, integrating them into our business model and using our acquired assets to further innovate. We have developed a philosophy, the OpenText Business System, that is designed to create value by leveraging a clear set of operational mandates for integrating newly acquired companies and assets. We see our ability to successfully integrate acquired companies and assets into our business as a strength and pursuing strategic acquisitions is an important aspect to our Total Growth strategy. We expect to continue to acquire strategically, to integrate and innovate, and to deepen and strengthen our intelligent information platform for customers.
We regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities and at any time may be at various stages of discussion with respect to such opportunities. For additional details on our acquisitions, please see "Acquisitions During the Last Five Fiscal Years", elsewhere in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In March 2020, COVID-19 was characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The spread of COVID-19 has significantly impacted the global economy and has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our operational and financial performance. The extent of the adverse impact of the pandemic on the global economy and markets will continue to depend, in part, on the length and severity of the measures taken to limit the spread of the virus, the availability, effectiveness and use of treatments and vaccines and, in part, on the size and effectiveness of the compensating measures taken by governments and on actual and potential resurgences. We are closely monitoring the potential effects and impact on our operations, businesses and financial performance, including liquidity and capital usage, though the extent is difficult to fully predict at this time due to the rapid evolution of this uncertain situation. 
We continue to conduct business with substantial modifications to employee travel and work locations and also virtualization of sales and marketing events, which we expect to remain in place throughout calendar year 2021, along with substantially modified interactions with customers and suppliers, among other modifications. We will continue to actively monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and geographies, including customer purchasing decisions, and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by governments, or that we determine are in the best interest of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and shareholders. It is uncertain and difficult to predict what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business including the effects on our customers and prospects, or our financial results and our ability to successfully execute our business strategies and initiatives. 
As previously disclosed, in order to further mitigate the operational impacts of COVID-19, our Compensation Committee and Board approved certain compensation adjustments, effective for the period May 15, 2020 through June 30, 2021, subject to review and modification as the situation warranted. As a precaution, we also temporarily and significantly reduced all hiring and discretionary spending, while taking note of some savings to be achieved through travel restrictions and the cancellation of certain events. These cost reduction measures were in addition to other previously disclosed facilities and workforce related actions as part of our COVID-19 Restructuring Plan. Please see note 18 "Special Charges (Recoveries)" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
After careful consideration and review, the Compensation Committee and Board approved the restoration, effective December 1, 2020 and ahead of the initially contemplated May 15, 2020 through June 30, 2021 duration described above, of all previously announced compensation adjustments. We continue to closely monitor discretionary spending, and remain active in our hiring across the organization.
The ongoing and ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control. For more information, please see Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors" included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
OpenText Revenues
Our business consists of four revenue streams: cloud services and subscriptions, customer support, license, and professional service and other. For information regarding our revenues by significant geographic area for Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, please see note 20 “Segment Information” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Cloud Services and Subscriptions
Cloud services and subscription revenues consist of (i) SaaS offerings, (ii) hosted services and (iii) managed service arrangements. These offerings allow customers to transmit a variety of content between various mediums and to securely manage enterprise information without the commitment of investing in related hardware infrastructure.
We offer B2B integration solutions such as messaging and managed services. Messaging services allow for the automated and reliable exchange of electronic transaction information, such as purchase orders, invoices, shipment notices and other business documents, among businesses worldwide. Managed services provide an end-to-end fully outsourced B2B integration solution to our customers, including program implementation, operational management, and customer support. Our cloud-based Business Network enables customers to effectively manage the flow of electronic transaction information with their trading partners and reduces the complexity of disparate standards and communication protocols.
Customer Support
The first year of our customer support offering is usually purchased by customers together with the license of our Information Management software products. Customer support is typically renewed on an annual basis and historically customer support revenues have been a significant portion of our total revenue. Through our OpenText customer support programs, customers receive access to software and security upgrades, a knowledge base, discussions, product information, and an online mechanism to post and review “trouble tickets”. Additionally, our customer support teams handle questions on the 

use, configuration, and functionality of OpenText products and can help identify software issues, develop solutions, and document enhancement requests for consideration in future product releases.
License
License revenues consist of fees earned from the licensing of software products to our customers. Our license revenues are impacted by the strength of general economic and industry conditions, the competitive strength of our software products, and our acquisitions. The decision by a customer to license our software products often involves a comprehensive implementation process across the customer’s network or networks and the licensing and implementation of our software products may entail a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers.
Professional Service and Other
We provide consulting and learning services to customers. Generally, these services relate to the implementation, training and integration of our licensed product offerings into the customer's systems.
Our consulting services help customers build solutions that enable them to leverage their investments in our technology and in existing enterprise systems. The implementation of these services can range from simple modifications to meet specific departmental needs to enterprise applications that integrate with multiple existing systems.
Our learning services consultants analyze our customers' education and training needs, focusing on key learning outcomes and timelines, with a view to creating an appropriate education plan for the employees of our customers who work with our products. Education plans are designed to be flexible and can be applied to any phase of implementation: pilot, roll-out, upgrade or refresher. OpenText learning services employ a blended approach by combining mentoring, instructor-led courses, webinars, eLearning and focused workshops.
Marketing and Sales
Customers
Our customer base consists of G10K organizations, enterprise companies, public sector agencies, mid-market companies, SMB and direct consumers. 
Partners and Alliances
We are committed to establishing relationships with the best resellers and technology and service providers to ensure customer success. Together as partners, we fulfill key market objectives to drive new business, establish a competitive advantage, and create demonstrable business value.
We have a number of strategic partnerships that are essential to our success. These include the most prominent organizations in enterprise software, hardware and public cloud, with whom we work to enhance the value of customer investments. They include:
•SAP SE (SAP): We are SAP’s partner for content services. The OpenText Suite for SAP solutions provides key business content within the context of SAP business processes providing enhanced efficiencies, reduced risk and better experiences for customers, employees and partners - accessible anywhere and anytime and available on and off-cloud.
•Google Cloud: We work together with Google Cloud to deploy our Information Management solutions on the Google Cloud Platform as fully managed services. This includes a containerized application architecture for flexible cloud or hybrid deployment models. Deploying our solutions on the Google Cloud Platform allows our customers to scale their deployments as their businesses demand. We also work with the Google Cloud engineering team to explore integrations with Google AI/ML, Analytics, G-Suite and other functions.
•Amazon Web Services (AWS): Our collaboration offers businesses the opportunity to consume our Information Management solutions as fully managed services on AWS for cost savings, increased performance, scalability and security.
•Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft): Together with Microsoft, we enable customers to connect all aspects of their content infrastructure, integrating these into business processes and enable collaboration, management and governance on the most valuable asset - information.
•Oracle Corporation (Oracle): We develop innovative solutions for Oracle applications that enhance the experience and productivity of users working with these tools.

•Salesforce.com Corporation (Salesforce): The company-to-company partnership between OpenText and Salesforce is focused on growing a full portfolio of Information Management solutions to complement the Salesforce ecosystem by uniting the structured and unstructured information experience.
Our Global Partner Program offers five distinct programs: Referral, Reseller, Services, Technology, and Support. This creates an extended organization to develop technologies, repeatable service offerings, and solutions that enhance the way our customers maximize their investment in our products and services. Through the Global Partner Program, we are extending market coverage, building stronger relationships, and providing customers with a more complete local ecosystem of partners to meet their needs. Each distinct program is focused to provide valuable business benefits to the joint relationship.
Global Systems Integrators (GSIs) provide customers with digital transformational services around OpenText technologies. They are trained and certified on OpenText solutions and enhance the value of our offerings by providing technical credibility and complementary services to customers. Our GSIs include, Accenture plc, ATOS International S.A.S., Capgemini Technology Services SAS, Cognizant Technology Solutions U.S. Corp., Deloitte Consulting LLP, and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS).
Our partner programs also enable managed service providers (MSPs), resellers, distributors, and network and security vendors to grow through cloud-based cybersecurity, threat intelligence, and backup and recovery solutions aimed at the SMB and consumer markets. We provide the industry-specific tools, services, training, integrations, certifications, and platforms our partners need to ensure trust and reliability with their customer base.
International Markets
We provide our product offerings worldwide. Our geographic coverage allows us to draw on business and technical expertise from a geographically diverse workforce, providing greater stability to our operations and revenue streams by diversifying our portfolio to better mitigate against the risks of a single geographically focused business.
There are inherent risks to conducting operations internationally. For more information about these risks, see “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competition
The market for our products and services is highly competitive, subject to rapid technological change and shifting customer needs and economic pressures. We compete with multiple companies, some that have single or narrow solutions and some that have a range of information management solutions, like us. Our primary competitor is International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), with numerous other software vendors competing with us in the Information Management sector, such as Veeva Systems Inc., Quadient Inc., Pegasystems Inc., Hyland Software Inc., SPS Commerce Inc., Box Inc. and Adobe Systems Inc. In certain markets, OpenText competes with Oracle and Microsoft, who are also our partners. In addition, we also face competition from systems integrators that configure hardware and software into customized systems. Additionally, new competitors or alliances among existing competitors may emerge and could rapidly acquire additional market share. We also expect that competition will increase as a result of ongoing software industry consolidation.
We believe that certain competitive factors affect the market for our software products and services, which may include: (i) vendor and product reputation; (ii) product quality, performance and price; (iii) the availability of software products on multiple platforms; (iv) product scalability; (v) product integration with other enterprise applications; (vi) software functionality and features; (vii) software ease of use; (viii) the quality of professional services, customer support services and training; and (ix) the ability to address specific customer business problems. We believe the relative importance of each of these factors depends upon the concerns and needs of each specific customer.
Research and Development
The industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements and competitive new products and features. As a result, our success, in part, depends on our ability to continue to enhance our existing products in a timely and efficient manner and to develop and introduce new products that meet customer needs while reducing total cost of ownership. To achieve these objectives, we have made and expect to continue to make investments in research and development, through internal and third-party development activities, third-party licensing agreements and potentially through technology acquisitions. Our R&D expenses were $421.4 million for Fiscal 2021, $370.4 million for Fiscal 2020 and $321.8 million for Fiscal 2019. We believe our spending on research and development is an appropriate balance between managing our organic growth and results of operations. We expect to continue to invest in R&D to maintain and improve our products and services offerings.
Acquisitions During the Last Five Fiscal Years
We regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities within the Information Management market and at any time may be in various stages of discussions with respect to such opportunities.
Below is a summary of the more material acquisitions we have made over the last five fiscal years.
•On March 9, 2020, we acquired XMedius, a provider of secure information exchange and unified communication solutions, for $73.5 million.
•On December 24, 2019, we acquired Carbonite Inc. (Carbonite), a leading provider of cloud-based subscription backup, disaster recovery and endpoint security to SMB, consumers, and a wide variety of partners, for $1.4 billion.
•On December 2, 2019, we acquired certain assets and certain liabilities of Dynamic Solutions Group (The Fax Guys) for $5.1 million.
•On January 31, 2019, we acquired Catalyst, a leading provider of eDiscovery that designs, develops and supports market-leading cloud eDiscovery software, for $71.4 million.
•On December 17, 2018, we acquired Liaison, a leading provider of cloud-based business to business integration, for $310.6 million.
•On February 14, 2018, we acquired Hightail, a leading cloud service for file sharing and creative collaboration, for $20.5 million.

•On January 23, 2017, we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of the enterprise content division of EMC Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation, and certain of its subsidiaries (ECD Business) for $1.62 billion.
•On July 31, 2016, we acquired certain customer communications management software services assets and liabilities from HP Inc. (CCM Business) for $315.0 million.
•On July 20, 2016, we acquired Recommind, a leading provider of eDiscovery and information analytics, based in San Francisco, California, United States, for $170.1 million.
We believe our acquisitions support our long-term strategy for growth, strengthen our competitive position, expand our customer base and provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, grow our earnings and provide superior shareholder value. We expect to continue to strategically acquire companies, products, services and technologies to augment our existing business.
Intellectual Property Rights
Our success and ability to compete depends in part on our ability to develop, protect and maintain our intellectual property and proprietary technology and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. Our software products are generally licensed to our customers on a non-exclusive basis for internal use in a customer's organization. We also grant rights to our intellectual property to third parties that allow them to market certain of our products on a non-exclusive or limited-scope exclusive basis for a particular application of the product(s) or to a particular geographic area.
We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws, non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and maintain our proprietary rights. We have obtained or applied for trademark registration for corporate and strategic product names in selected major markets. We have a number of U.S. and foreign patents and pending applications, including patents and rights to patent applications acquired through strategic transactions, which relate to various aspects of our products and technology. The duration of our patents is determined by the laws of the country of issuance and is typically 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application resulting in the patent. From time to time, we may enforce our intellectual property rights through litigation in line with our strategic and business objectives. While we believe our intellectual property is valuable and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our success, we also believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent, trademark, license, or other intellectual property right.
For more information on the risks related to our intellectual property rights, see "Risk Factors" included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Looking Towards the Future 
In Fiscal 2022 we intend to continue to implement strategies that are designed to: 

Broaden Our Reach into Information Management through the G10K. As technologies and customers become more sophisticated, we intend to be a leader in expanding the definition of traditional market sectors. We continue to expand our direct sales coverage of the G10K as we focus on connecting this marquee customer base to our information platform.
Invest in the Cloud. Today, the destination for innovation is indisputably the cloud. Businesses of all sizes rely on a combination of public and private clouds, managed services and off-cloud solutions. As a result, we are committed to continue to modernize technology infrastructure and leverage our existing investments in the OpenText Cloud. The combination of OpenText cloud-native applications and managed services, together with the scalability and performance of our partner public cloud providers, offer more secure, reliable and compliant solutions to customers wanting to deploy cloud-based Information Management applications. The OpenText Cloud is designed to build additional flexibility and scalability for our customers: becoming cloud-native, connecting anything, and extending capabilities quickly with multi-tenant SaaS applications and services.
Deepen Existing Customer Footprint. We believe one of our greatest opportunities is to sell newly developed or acquired technologies to our existing customer base, and cross-sell historical OpenText products to newly acquired customers. We have significant expertise in a number of industry sectors and aim to increase our customer penetration based on our strong credentials. We are particularly focused on circumstances where the customer is looking to consolidate multiple vendors with solutions from a single source while addressing a broader spectrum of business problems or equally new or existing customers looking to take a more holistic approach to digital transformation.
Invest in Technology Leadership. We believe we are well-positioned to develop additional innovative solutions to address the evolving market. We plan to continue investing in technology “innovation” by funding internal development as well as collaborating with third-parties.
Deepen Strategic Partnerships. OpenText is committed culturally, programmatically and strategically to be a partner-embracing company. Our partnerships with companies such as SAP SE, Google Cloud, Amazon AWS, Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, Salesforce.com Corporation and others serve as examples of how we are working together with our partners to create next-generation Information Management solutions and deliver them to market. We will continue to look for ways to create more customer value from our strategic partnerships.
Broaden Global Presence. As customers become increasingly multi-national and as international markets continue to adopt Information Management, we plan to further grow our brand, presence, and partner networks in these new markets. We are focused on using our direct sales for targeting existing G10K customers and plan to address new geographies and SMB customers, jointly with our partners.
Selectively Pursue Acquisitions. We expect to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions to strengthen our service offerings in the Information Management market. In light of the continually evolving marketplace in which we operate, we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities within the Information Management market and at any time may be in various stages of discussions with respect to such opportunities. We plan to continue to pursue acquisitions that complement our existing business, represent a strong strategic fit and are consistent with our overall growth strategy and disciplined financial management. We may also target future acquisitions to expand or add functionality and capabilities to our existing portfolio of solutions, as well as add new solutions to our portfolio.
Human Capital
Our Global Footprint
Our ability to attract, retain and engage a diverse workforce committed to innovation, operational excellence and the OpenText mission and values across our global footprint is a cornerstone to our success.
As of June 30, 2021, we employed a total of approximately 14,300 individuals, of which 6,800 or 48% are in the Americas, 2,600 or 18% are in EMEA and 4,900 or 34% are in Asia Pacific. Currently, we have employees in 34 countries enabling strong access to multiple talent pools while ensuring reach and proximity to our customers. Please see "Results of Operations" included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for our definitions of geographic regions.
The approximate composition of our employee base is as follows: (i) 2,400 employees in sales and marketing, (ii) 4,200 employees in product development, (iii) 3,300 employees in cloud services, (iv) 1,400 employees in professional services, (v) 1,100 employees in customer support, and (vi) 1,900 employees in general and administrative roles. 
We believe that relations with our employees are strong. None of our employees are represented by a labour union, nor do we have collective bargaining arrangements with any of our employees. However, in certain international jurisdictions in which we operate, a “Workers' Council” represents our employees.
Employee Safety / COVID-19 Response
In response to the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented Project Shield as a business continuity plan to address employee, customer, facility and technology-related challenges associated with the pandemic. Project Shield maintains the overarching principle of providing safe environments for our employees, customers, partners, as well as the communities where we work.
Project Shield takes a strong human capital focus, including enabling well-researched global awareness, post-pandemic support for our employees and managing a safe return to our workplace. We focus on analyzing key COVID-19 related data to support executive decisions, ensuring regular executive and employee communications and making strong connections with leaders around the world to respond swiftly to local changes.
Through effective use of collaboration tools and technology, a significant majority of employees are working entirely remotely without a disruption to productivity. Over the course of the pandemic, we have ensured our benefit programs support employees, and we established the OpenText Relief Fund to provide financial assistance for employees requiring additional support for medical costs related to contracting COVID-19. A daily case management protocol is in place to ensure a deep understanding of any impacts.
Changes to governmental orders are monitored and used in planning the phased re-opening of our offices. While it is our intention to return to the office, it will be gradual, flexible in workplace, rooted in an understanding of local circumstances and guided by safety-first principles. Our new flexible workplace approach will combine the benefits of in-person collaboration with increased flexibility to drive both innovation and productivity. Our past experiences will be used to inform our future workplace standards.
Employee Engagement
We regularly conduct employee research to understand perceptions in the areas of engagement, company strategy, personal impact, manager effectiveness, recognition, career development and equity, diversity and inclusion. Participation level and engagement remain high. Throughout the pandemic employee communication and listening strategies increased, including supplemental surveys ranging from perceptions of safety and well-being, to feedback and office re-opening plans.
Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (ED&I)
We are passionate about creating an inclusive environment where skilled and diverse employees thrive, deliver compelling innovations to our customers and provide shareholder value. We are committed to increasing equity in opportunity for all employees regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion or other differences. 
At OpenText, we have established a global Equity, Diversity and Inclusion steering committee to guide ED&I programs. We bring our ambition to life through impact teams made of employees who come together to recommend policies, programs and initiatives across a range of topics.
Our impact teams are leading global initiatives with local impact which include: 
•Awareness and Training: For employees and managers on matters such as inclusive leadership practices and diversity awareness;
•Recruiting: Platforms that are inclusive, diverse slates for key leadership roles, an increased focus on virtual work opportunities to widen recruiting talent and diversity;
•Advancement: Internal career building opportunities, mentoring and networks;
•Advocacy: Employee affinity groups, including "Black Employee Engagement" and "Women in Technology", fostering sponsorship, community and career conversations; and
•Civic Action: Focusing an ED&I lens on community outreach and engagement.
Compensation and Benefits
Our compensation philosophy is based on a set of principles that align with business strategy, reflect business and individual performance levels, consider market conditions to ensure competitiveness, demonstrate internal pay equity for similar roles and reflect the impact that economic conditions have on pay programs.
Our compensation and benefit programs are regularly reviewed through an executive-sponsored governance process. Across the Company, we offer a wide variety of retirement and group benefits including medical, life and disability, which are designed to protect employees and their dependents against financial hardship due to illness or injury. We also have regional Employee Assistance Programs in many countries that provide 24/7 confidential counselling, support and access to resources for employees and their families. The OpenText Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) is a global benefit program that allows 

all eligible employees to purchase OpenText shares at a 15% discount and provides the opportunity for employees to strengthen their ownership in the Company while enjoying the benefits of potential share price appreciation. 
Internal equity is a cornerstone of our goals. Our pay programs are carefully designed and governed, from hiring practices to consistency in progression rates for common roles. In designing variable pay for performance awards, we focus only on measurable outcomes rather than subjective measures. This ensures true equity in opportunity and awards tied to business results.
Employee Education, Training and Compliance
We know that employees join OpenText for continuous learning, experience and credentials to shape their careers. Our strategies focus on ensuring strong technical credentials, building capabilities, new skills sets and a high duty of care in ensuring ethical, secure and compliant practices.
Internal applications to job postings are highly encouraged. Employees have internal access to certification on OpenText and partner products. Our annual Career Day focuses on career development planning and honing manager skills in developing teams. We offer an annual education reimbursement program to all employees globally. This program aligns with our commitment to support internal development, equal opportunity and mobility across all of our geographies, regardless of an employee’s role, function or location. We have designed the education reimbursement program to meet the needs of all personalized development goals through programs that range from technical to business skills. 
As part of our commitment to the highest standards of conduct, all employees and contractors participate in an annual formal Compliance and Data Security Training, including Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Responsible Business Practices, Data Protection, Global Data Privacy Practices, Protecting Information and Preventing Sexual Harassment Training. These compliance programs ensure that we operate our business with integrity, following standard business ethics across the globe.
Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG)
We support many global and local employee-led initiatives. Our charitable giving program supports activities focused on education, innovation and disaster relief while also providing employees three paid days off to volunteer and make an impact in their community. In addition, we recently launched the OpenText Voyager Fund to identify and address key needs in our communities. To operate long-term, we need to ensure that our local communities and the natural environment are thriving. We are committed to mitigating the adverse environmental impacts of our business activities, which at a minimum means abiding by all environmental laws, regulations and standards that apply to us. Our Environmental Policy articulates our commitment to measuring and managing our environmental impact. We have established short-term environmental goals on energy consumption, waste diversion and greenhouse gas emissions.
