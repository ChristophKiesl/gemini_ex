Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and advancement of immunology-based therapies for prevalent inflammatory conditions. 
Ampion, our lead product candidate, is in the process of advancing through clinical trials in the United States. Ampion is currently in development as an intra-articular injection treatment for severe Osteoarthritis of the Knee (“OAK”); an intravenous (“IV”) treatment for COVID-19 patients; and an inhaled treatment for COVID-19 induced respiratory distress. 
In June 2019, we commenced our AP-013 study titled, “A Randomized, Controlled, Double-Blind Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of an Intra-Articular Injection of Ampion in Adults with Pain Due to Severe Osteoarthritis of the Knee”. In January 2020, the United States Department of Health and Human Services declared COVID-19 a public health emergency in the United States and in March 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. In April 2020, due to the impact of COVID-19, we paused the ongoing conduct of the AP-013 study. As COVID-19 cases across the United States continue to be reported, we have determined that the AP-013 study will remain paused, but we continue to actively explore viable options to enable us to complete the study. Recently, the FDA has provided guidance specifically designed to assist the pharmaceutical industry with viable options for evaluating data from clinical trials which were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We are reviewing the FDA guidance as it relates to the AP-013 study data and are working with the FDA to come to agreement on a proposal to finalize the AP-013 study. However, it is possible that the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic may prevent completion of the AP-013 study at this time or at all. Finally, due to the current uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the future contractual commitment amount related to the AP-013 study may significantly change. 
In June 2020, we received FDA agreement to proceed with human trials utilizing an IV Ampion treatment for COVID-19 patients, and we commenced a Phase I study (the “AP-016 study”) for such treatment, in July 2020. In September 2020, we announced the results of the AP-016 study, which met its primary endpoint and found Ampion to be safe and well-tolerated with no remarkable difference in the incidence, frequency, and severity of adverse events between IV Ampion and standard of care (“SOC”). In December 2020, we initiated an expanded Phase I / II global study of IV Ampion treatment in Israel and the United States with the focus on patient safety and efficacy, as measured by improvement in the clinical course of the disease and related outcomes for patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. 
In September 2020, we received FDA agreement to proceed with human trials utilizing Ampion by inhalation as a treatment for COVID-19 patients who have respiratory distress. In October 2020, we commenced a Phase I study (the “AP-014 study”) for such treatment. We plan to enroll 40 patients in the AP-014 study and randomize 1:1, Ampion in addition to the SOC versus SOC alone. Each patient in the study will inhale 8 mL doses of Ampion four times a day for five days. Safety is the primary end-point and various measurements indicative of efficacy are secondary endpoints. 
We believe the immunomodulatory action and anti-inflammatory effects of Ampion may provide a treatment for individuals with inflammatory conditions including severe OAK and the widespread inflammation associated with COVID-19 infection.
Our therapeutic product pipeline is the result of more than two decades of research at leading hospital-based research centers. Significant discoveries in both scientific and clinical research have been published in peer-reviewed journals, highlighting the depth of research supporting Ampion’s therapeutic capabilities. Ampion is backed by an extensive patent portfolio and eligible for 12-year FDA market exclusivity upon approval as a novel biologic under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (“BPCIA”).

AMPION 
We have developed a novel biologic drug, Ampion, which contains a blood-derived cyclized peptide and small molecules that target multiple pathways in the innate immune response characteristic of inflammatory disease. In vitro studies have shown that Ampion represses the transcription of proteins responsible for inflammation, while activating anti-inflammatory proteins responsible for signaling tissue growth and healing. Ampion achieves its biological effect by targeting the over production of inflammatory cytokines, which is common in multiple inflammatory diseases like osteoarthritis and respiratory disease, and other inflammatory conditions. Ampion has been shown to uniquely reduce inflammation along multiple pathways, unlike other anti-inflammatory therapies that target only one mechanism.

Ampion has been developed for use, and has been cleared by the FDA for investigation, by multiple routes of administration.


● | Injection places Ampion right where it is needed to locally treat inflammation. The osteoarthritis trials are evaluating the safety and efficacy of injection into the joint.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Inhalation provides direct application of Ampion to locally treat inflammation in the lungs. The COVID-19 clinical trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of Ampion inhalation in the lungs of COVID-19 patients with respiratory illness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Intravenous provides systemic application of Ampion to broadly treat inflammation throughout the body. The COVID-19 clinical trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of Ampion IV treatment in COVID-19 patients with respiratory illness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
We believe that the Ampion mechanism of action provides a therapeutic effect by interrupting the dysregulated immune system responsible for the disease, damage, and pain attributed to many inflammatory and degenerative conditions. Ampion is considered a platform drug which is potentially useful for several inflammatory diseases throughout the body. 
​
Ampion for Osteoarthritis 
Ampion targets the cellular pathways in the innate immune response correlated with pain, inflammation, and joint damage in osteoarthritis. As described above, in vitro studies have shown that Ampion represses the transcription of inflammatory cytokines responsible for inflammation, while activating anti-inflammatory proteins responsible for tissue growth and healing. We believe that this mechanism of action interrupts the disease process responsible for the pain and disability associated with OAK while providing a market expansion potential as a disease modifying biologic drug.

We are currently developing Ampion as an intra-articular injection to treat the signs and symptoms of severe OAK, which continues to be a growing epidemic in the United States and other countries worldwide. OAK is a progressive disease characterized by gradual degradation and loss of cartilage due to inflammation of the soft tissue and bony structures of the knee joint. Progression of the most severe form of OAK leaves patients with little or no treatment options other than a total knee arthroplasty. The FDA has asserted that severe OAK is an “unmet medical need” with no existing licensed therapy available. While we believe that Ampion could successfully treat this “unmet medical need”, our ability to market this product is subject to FDA approval.
Osteoarthritis Market Opportunity
Osteoarthritis (“OA”) is the most common form of arthritis, and according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the “CDC”), OA affects over 32.5 million people in the United States. It is a progressive and incurable disease of the joints involving degradation of the intra-articular cartilage, joint lining, ligaments, and bone. Certain risk factors in conjunction with natural wear and tear lead to the breakdown of cartilage. Osteoarthritis is caused by inflammation of the soft tissue and bony structures of the joint, which worsens over time and leads to progressive thinning of intra-articular cartilage. Other progressive effects include narrowing of the joint space, synovial membrane thickening, osteophyte formation and increased density of the subchondral bone. Based on Market Insights Report’s most recently published study on Global Osteoarthritis Therapeutics Market by Anatomy (Knee, Hand), Drug Type (NSAIDs, Analgesics, Corticosteroids), Route of Administration (Parenteral), Distribution Channel (Hospital Pharmacies), Purchasing Pattern (Prescription Drugs) - Global Forecast to 2026, the OA therapeutics market is projected to reach $12.4 billion by 2026 from $7.3 billion in 2020, at a compound annual growth rate of 8.7% from 2021 to 2026. The global demand for OAK treatment is expected to be fueled by aging demographics and increased awareness of treatment options. Despite the size and growth of the OAK market, only a few treatment options currently exist, with none labeled specifically for the severely diseased patient population. 
Ampion Development for Osteoarthritis 
Since our inception, we have conducted multiple clinical trials and have advanced through late-stage clinical trials in the United States, initially under the guidance of the FDA’s Office of Blood Research and Review and most recently under the guidance of the FDA’s Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies.
Study AP-003-A was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind Phase III trial of 329 patients who were randomized 1:1 to receive Ampion or saline control via intra-articular injection. The study showed a statistically significant reduction in pain compared to the control, with an average of greater than 40% reduction in pain from baseline at 12 weeks with Ampion treatment. Patients who received Ampion also showed a significant improvement in function and quality of life compared to patients who received the saline control at 12 weeks. Quality of life was assessed using Patient Global Assessment. Furthermore, the trial included severely diseased patients, defined radiographically as Kellgren Lawrence Grade 4 (“KL 4”). From this patient population, those patients who received Ampion had a significantly greater 

7




reduction in pain than those who received the saline control. Ampion was well tolerated with minimal adverse events reported in either the Ampion or saline treated groups. There were no drug-related serious adverse events in either group.
In 2018, the FDA reiterated and confirmed that our successful pivotal Phase III clinical trial, AP-003-A, was adequate and well-controlled, provided evidence of the effectiveness of Ampion and can contribute to the substantial evidence of effectiveness necessary for the approval of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”). The FDA provided guidance that we should complete an additional Phase III trial of KL 4 severe OAK patients with concurrent controls that would be carried out under a Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”) to obtain FDA concurrence on the trial design prior to initiation of the trial.
We received an SPA agreement in June 2019 from the FDA for a Phase III clinical protocol in reference to the AP-013 study. The SPA agreement for the AP-013 study finalized patient enrollment at 1,034 patients, with a sample size assessment at an interim analysis of 724 patients to allow an adjustment up to 1,551 patients if deemed necessary. In the SPA agreement, the FDA agreed that the design and planned analysis of the AP-013 study adequately addressed the objectives necessary to support a regulatory submission. According to the FDA’s guidance regarding SPAs (published in April 2018), an SPA documents the FDA’s agreement that the design and planned analysis of a study can address objectives in support of a regulatory submission; however, the final determinations for marketing application approval are made after a complete review of the marketing application and are based on the entire data in the application. Following the receipt of the SPA agreement, we initiated the AP-013 study, identified and engaged clinical sites for the clinical trial, and initiated dosing of patients at those sites. 
In January 2020, the United States Department of Health and Human Services declared COVID-19 a public health emergency in the United States and the CDC indicated that older adults, age 65 years and older, are at higher risk for severe illness as a result of COVID-19. The AP-013 study focuses on individuals with the most severely diseased OAK, which represents an underserved patient population typically excluded from clinical studies because of the intractable nature of their condition. The AP-013 study population is comprised of elderly patients with an average age of 65 years old and a maximum age of 87 years. Therefore, guidance from the CDC indicates the AP-013 study population is the highest risk demographic for developing severe illness during the current COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2020, and updated on January 27, 2021, the FDA acknowledged the impact of COVID-19 on clinical trials in published guidance, “FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during the COVID-19 Pandemic”, which outlines the Agency’s recommendations for ensuring clinical trial participant safety and adherence to good clinical practice guidelines and protocol requirements for clinical trials during the outbreak. In concurrence with the FDA guidance, the Safety Monitoring Committee (“SMC”) for the AP-013 study recognized the impact of COVID-19 on the clinical trial. In April 2020, we paused ongoing conduct of the AP-013 study, and we continue to monitor the COVID-19 health situation and updated FDA guidance on conducting clinical trials in a pandemic. COVID-19 cases across the United States continue to be reported, therefore, we have determined that the AP-013 study will remain paused as we continue to explore options to enable us to complete the study. Currently, the Company is evaluating options for the AP-013 study using scientific publications and the FDA guidance including, “Statistical Considerations for Clinical Trials During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency”, which is specifically designed to assist the pharmaceutical industry with viable options for evaluating data from clinical trials which were adversely impacted by the pandemic. In order to remain in compliance with such guidance, we are working with the FDA on a proposal for the AP-013 study. However, it is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic may prevent completion of the AP-013 study at this time or at all.
​
Ampion for COVID-19
Nonclinical in vitro studies show Ampion decreases the production of inflammatory cytokines associated with the hyperactive inflammatory response present during COVID-19 infection. Elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines are correlated with COVID-19 severity and may also trigger additional complications including pneumonia, acute lung injury (“ALI”) and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome (“ARDS”), which is a leading cause of mortality in COVID-19. By targeting and reducing the production of these inflammatory cytokines, Ampion may improve the clinical outcome for patients with COVID-19.
Due to its mode of action, Ampion may be a viable treatment option for those infected with COVID-19 to improve clinical outcomes and decrease the progression and severity of associated COVID-19 inflammatory conditions (i.e., COVID-19 pneumonia, ALI, ARDS, and ultimately mortality). Accordingly, Ampion may provide an early intervention option for COVID-19 patients.

COVID-19 Market Opportunity
​
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in millions of cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide with figures continuing to reflect significant expansion of the pandemic. The COVID-19 infection is an acute respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2). Once infected, the COVID-19 virus moves into a patient’s respiratory tract where the lungs may become inflamed, making breathing difficult and requiring treatment with oxygen. The CDC has estimated that approximately 20% of patients with COVID-19 will progress to a severe disease condition, requiring hospitalization and clinical care. Complications of severe COVID-19 infection include ARDS, ALI, pneumonia, sepsis and septic shock, cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia, acute kidney injury and prolonged hospitalization for other complications (i.e., secondary bacterial infection). The COVID-19 pandemic continues to transform the growth of various industries and the immediate impact varies. At the time of this filing, the ability to provide a reliable estimate of the potential global market size for COVID-19 therapeutics is in the preliminary stages and widely unknown at this time. We believe that it is imperative that effective treatments are identified and developed to address the full spectrum of clinical features of COVID-19 infection, from the need for oxygen to the progression to ARDS. 
​
As an immunomodulatory agent, we believe that Ampion may be effective in improving the clinical course and outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Ampion Development for Treating COVID-19 Induced Inflammation 
Ampion is in development as a novel biologic drug that regulates multiple therapeutic targets in the innate immune system responsible for the inflammation, tissue damage and pathogenesis associated with dysregulated immune disorders. Due to its mode of action, Ampion may be a viable treatment option for those infected with COVID-19 to improve clinical outcomes and slow the progression and severity with associated critical COVID-19 inflammatory conditions (i.e., progression to respiratory failure, the need for assisted breathing and ultimately mortality).
In May 2020, we submitted an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application for the IV treatment of adults with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen. In June 2020, we received FDA agreement to proceed with human trials utilizing an IV Ampion treatment for COVID-19 patients who require supplemental oxygen, and we commenced the Phase I AP-016 study in July 2020. In September 2020, we announced the results of the AP-016 study, which met its primary endpoint and found Ampion to be safe and well-tolerated with no remarkable difference in the incidence, frequency, and severity of adverse events between IV Ampion and SOC. These patients were followed for 90-days following treatment to complete their safety assessments and the SMC found the IV treatment of Ampion to be safe and well-tolerated. Secondary efficacy endpoints from the study suggest Ampion may improve the clinical outcome for patients with COVID-19 as measured by the ordinal scale of clinical improvement as recommended by the WHO, and by the National Early Warning Score, as recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in its guidelines for the management of COVID-19 patients in critical care. Following these results, in December 2020, the Company initiated an expanded global Phase I / II clinical trial for IV Ampion treatment in COVID-19 patients.
In August 2020, we submitted preclinical safety data to support the IND application for inhalation treatment of adults with respiratory distress due to COVID-19 infection. In September 2020, we received FDA agreement to proceed with human trials utilizing inhalation Ampion as a treatment for COVID-19 patients who have respiratory distress, and we commenced the AP-014 study during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.
We continue to communicate on a regular basis with the FDA to advance the development of these programs. As an immunomodulatory agent, with anti-inflammatory effects, we believe Ampion may be effective in interrupting the inflammatory cascade associated with COVID-19 and improving the clinical course and outcome for patients.
Due to the global pandemic, the number of COVID-19 cases, and the need for new treatments, regulatory authorities are applying emergency approval programs. These programs include the Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) program in the United States. We may seek an EUA from the FDA for the use of Ampion in respiratory distress due to COVID-19 infection. If we decide to apply for an EUA and it is granted, a separate regulatory process will be needed in order to obtain a full marketing authorization (i.e., non-emergency authorization) for the use of Ampion in COVID-19 patients.

Ampion Manufacturing Facility
In May 2014, we commenced a 125-month lease of a multi-purpose facility containing approximately 19,000 square feet. This facility includes quality control and research laboratories, our corporate offices and approximately 3,000 square feet of modular clean rooms to manufacture Ampion.
Since the manufacturing site has been operational, we have implemented a quality system for both U.S. and European Union (“EU”) regulatory compliance, validated the facility for human-use products, produced Ampion and placebo for use in the inception-to-date clinical trials, and produced approximately 200,000 5mL vials of Ampion without a sterility failure. In addition, over 1,000 IV bags have been filled for use in clinical trials with 125 mL of Ampion each without a sterility failure. 
The manufacturing facility utilizes automated equipment with single use line sets and modular clean rooms designed to maximize flexibility and scalability while meeting international quality standards to fulfill potential future global demand. We believe that the Ampion manufacturing process delivers a competitive cost of goods that is significantly lower than the industry benchmark. Additionally, we estimate that the maximum capacity for this turnkey facility is approximately 8 million 5 mL vials per year. An independent third-party has conducted a quality audit of the Ampion manufacturing facility, which confirmed that our facility is expected to meet the requirements of an FDA pre-approval inspection for the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls section of a BLA filing.
Competition 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid technological change as researchers learn more about diseases and develop new technologies and treatments. Significant competitive factors in our industry include product efficacy and safety; quality and breadth of an organization’s technology; skill of an organization’s employees and its ability to recruit and retain key employees; timing and scope of regulatory approvals; government and third party reimbursement rates for, and the average selling price of products; the availability of raw materials and qualified manufacturing capacity; manufacturing costs; intellectual property and patent rights and their protection; and sales and marketing capabilities.
Market acceptance of Ampion will depend on a number of factors, including: (i) its potential advantages over existing or alternative therapies; (ii) the actual or perceived safety of similar classes of products; (iii) the effectiveness of our sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities; and (iv) the scope of any approval provided by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities.
Although we believe Ampion possesses attractive attributes, we cannot assure that it will achieve regulatory approval or market acceptance, or that we will be able to compete effectively in the pharmaceutical drug markets. If Ampion fails to gain regulatory approvals and acceptance in its intended markets, we may not generate meaningful revenues or achieve profitability.

Government Regulation
FDA Approval Process 
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, record keeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve a pending BLA, adverse facility inspection reports (Form 483), untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
Pharmaceutical and biologic product development in the United States typically involves: 

● | the performance of satisfactory preclinical laboratory and animal studies under the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”), regulation;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the development and demonstration of manufacturing processes, which conform to the FDA mandated current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”), including a quality system regulating manufacturing;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the submission and acceptance of an IND application which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | obtaining the approval of Institutional Review Boards (“IRBs”) at each clinical trial site to protect the welfare and rights of human subjects in clinical trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the biologic for each indication for which FDA approval is sought; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the submission to the FDA for review and approval of a BLA, depending on the product’s components, intended effect, and claims.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease. Preclinical tests generally include laboratory evaluation of a product candidate, its chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as certain animal studies to assess its safety. Results of these preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information (in compliance with GLP and cGMP), analytical data and the clinical trial protocol (detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated), must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials can begin.
An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the intended conduct of the trial and imposes what is referred to as a clinical hold. Preclinical studies generally take several years to complete, and there is no guarantee that an IND based on those studies will become effective, allowing clinical testing to begin. In addition to the FDA review of an IND, each medical site that desires to participate in a proposed clinical trial must have the protocol reviewed and approved by an independent IRB or Ethics Committee (“EC”) for sites located outside of the United States. The IRB considers, among other things, ethical factors, and the selection and safety of human subjects. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”) requirements. The FDA and/or IRB/EC may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial or a specific clinical trial site to be halted at any time, or impose other sanctions for failure to comply with requirements under the appropriate entity jurisdiction.
Clinical trials to support BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. Ampio is seeking a BLA for Ampion’s treatment of severe OAK. In Phase I clinical trials, a product candidate is typically introduced either into healthy human subjects or patients with the medical condition for which the new drug is intended to be used. The main purpose of the trial is to assess a product candidate’s safety and the ability of 

11




the human body to tolerate the product candidate. Phase I clinical trials generally include less than 50 subjects or patients. During Phase II trials, a product candidate is studied in an exploratory trial or trials in a limited number of patients with the disease or medical condition for which it is intended to be used in order to: (i) further identify any possible adverse side effects and safety risks, (ii) assess the preliminary or potential efficacy of the product candidate for specific target diseases or medical conditions, and (iii) assess dosage tolerance and determine the optimal dose for Phase III trials. Phase III trials are generally undertaken to demonstrate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population with the goal of evaluating the overall risk-benefit relationship of the product candidate. Phase III trials will generally be designed to reach a specific goal or endpoint, the achievement of which is intended to demonstrate the product candidate’s clinical efficacy and provide adequate information for labeling of the biologic.
After completion of clinical testing under an IND, a BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The application must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. Under federal law, the submission of most of these applications are subject to an application user fee, currently $2.9 million. However, the FDA will waive the application user fee for the first human drug application that a small business or its affiliate submits for review. Small businesses are defined as businesses with less than 500 employees, therefore Ampio believes that it will be considered a small business and intends to submit a small business waiver for waiver of the BLA application user fee. The manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved BLA are also subject to an annual program fee, currently $325,000. The annual program fee replaced the product and establishment user fees that the FDA charged in prior years. These fees typically increase annually.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the FDA’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of BLAs. Applications for standard biologic products are typically reviewed within ten months; most applications for priority or accelerated biologics are reviewed in six months. There are accelerated review processes at the FDA, including Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval, none of which Ampio is currently seeking.
The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel biologic products, or biologic products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, which is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities where the biologic is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMP is satisfactory and the BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the biologic is safe and effective in the indication studied.
After the FDA evaluates the BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it will issue either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of the BLA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) to help ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.

We have advanced through late-stage clinical trials on Ampion for the treatment of OAK in the United States. Nevertheless, our current regulatory strategy may not secure the final regulatory approval of Ampion for the chosen product indications. In addition, the approval(s) if obtained, may take longer than anticipated. We can provide no assurance that Ampion will prove to be safe or effective, will receive required regulatory approvals, or, if approved, will be successfully commercialized.
Foreign Regulatory Approval
Outside of the United States, our ability to market Ampion will be contingent upon receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate foreign regulatory authorities, whether or not FDA approval has been obtained. The Common Technical Document used to assemble the Quality, Safety, and Efficacy information for submission of an Ampion BLA in the United States is currently recognized throughout Europe, Canada and Japan. The foreign regulatory approval process in most industrialized countries generally encompasses risks similar to those we will encounter in the FDA approval process. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and marketing authorizations, and the time required to obtain the requisite approvals, may vary widely from country to country and may differ from those required for FDA approval. 
Under EU regulatory systems, marketing authorizations may be submitted either under a centralized or decentralized procedure.
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and officially designated orphan medicines. For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the European Commission following a favorable opinion by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) as long as the medicine concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health.
The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval. The mutual recognition process results in separate national marketing authorizations in the reference member state and each concerned member state. 
We will seek to choose the appropriate route of European regulatory filing in an attempt to accomplish the most rapid regulatory approvals for Ampion when ready for review. However, the chosen regulatory strategy may not secure regulatory approval of Ampion for the chosen product indications. In addition, these approvals, if obtained, may take longer than anticipated. We can provide no assurance that Ampion will prove to be safe or effective, will receive required regulatory approvals, or, if approved, will be successfully commercialized.
BPCIA and Exclusivity
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively referred to as the “Affordable Care Act”), which was signed into law in 2010, included a subtitle known as the BPCIA. The BPCIA grants a novel biologic, or reference product, 12 years of market exclusivity. 
We believe that Ampion is a novel biologic product and, as such, we expect it will be granted 12 years of market exclusivity as measured from the FDA approval date.
Post-Approval Regulation
If a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval is typically limited to specific clinical indications. Furthermore, after regulatory approval is obtained, subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on its use or complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Any FDA-approved products manufactured or distributed by us will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse events or experiences. Further, biologic manufacturers and their 

13




subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose rigorous procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our contract manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future contract manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in, among other things, total or partial suspension of production activities, failure of the FDA to grant approval for marketing, and withdrawal, suspension, or revocation of marketing approvals.
If the FDA approves our BLA for Ampion’s treatment of severe OAK, we and the manufacturers of clinical supplies and commercial supplies must provide certain updated safety and efficacy information. Product changes, as well as certain changes in the manufacturing process or facilities where the manufacturing occurs, or other post-approval changes may necessitate additional FDA review and approval. The labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing, and distribution of a biologic product must also be in compliance with FDA and Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) requirements which include, among others, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. In addition, we are prohibited from promoting our products off-label. The FDA and FTC have very broad enforcement authority, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties, including the issuance of a warning letter or untitled letter directing us to correct deviations from regulatory requirements and enforcement actions that can include seizures, fines, injunctions, and criminal prosecution.
Other Regulatory Requirements
We are also subject to regulation by other regional, national, state and local agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and other regulatory bodies. Our current and future partners are subject to many of the same requirements.
In addition, we are subject to other regulations, including regulations under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, regulations promulgated by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the Toxic Substance Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and regulations under other federal, state, and local laws.
Violations of any of the foregoing requirements could result in penalties being assessed against us.
Privacy
Most health care providers, including research institutions from whom we or our partners obtain patient information, are subject to privacy and security rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (“HIPAA”). Additionally, strict personal privacy laws in other countries affect pharmaceutical companies’ activities in those countries. Such laws include the EU Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data, as well as individual EU Member States implementing additional laws. Although our clinical development efforts are not barred by these privacy regulations, we could face substantial criminal penalties if we knowingly receive individually identifiable health information from a health care provider that has not satisfied HIPAA’s or the EU’s disclosure standards. Failure by EU clinical trial partners to obey requirements of national laws on private personal data, including laws implementing the EU Data Protection Directive, might result in liability and/or adverse publicity.
Information Systems
We believe that our Information Systems (“IS”) capabilities are adequate to manage our core business. In addition, we believe our internal controls related to IS are operating effectively.
Intellectual Property Summary 
Ampion
We made the decision to focus available resources by limiting the maintenance of patent protection for Ampion based on the relative importance of technologies covered by patents, the geographic jurisdiction of patents and remaining patent

term. This allowed us to reduce the overall number of patents while maintaining our strategic coverage. The portfolio primarily consists of nine families filed in the United States and throughout the world. 
​
The first family includes U.S. patents and a European patent, validated and being maintained in Germany, Great Britain and France with claims relating to methods of treating inflammatory disease and compositions of matter that include an active component of Ampion (aspartyl-alanyl-diketopiperazine, or “DA-DKP”). This family also includes issued patents in China, Hong Kong, and Japan. The standard 20-year expiration for patents in this family will be on August 2, 2021.
​
The second family includes U.S. patents with claims directed to methods of treating inflammatory diseases with compositions of matter, including Ampion, and claims directed to such compositions of matter. This family also includes issued patents in Australia, China, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, South Africa, and Europe (validated in Germany, Great Britain, and France) and pending applications in the United States and Canada. The standard 20-year expiration for patents in this family will be in 2024.

The third family includes issued patents and pending applications world-wide, including issued patents in Australia, Canada, China, Russia, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, South Africa and Europe (validated in Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Spain, France, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, and Sweden), and pending applications in Brazil, Singapore, and the United States. The claims in this family are directed to the treatment of degenerative joint diseases. The standard 20-year expiration for patents in this family will be in 2032. 

The fourth family includes a U.S. patent, a pending U.S. application, issued patents in Australia, Japan and Europe (validated in Germany, Great Britain, France, Italy, and Switzerland), and pending applications in Canada, China, Hong Kong, and New Zealand with claims directed to the use of Ampion to mobilize, attract, expand and differentiate stem cells in the treatment of subjects. The standard 20-year expiration for patents in this family will be in 2034. 

The fifth family includes two U.S. patents, a pending U.S. application, issued patents in Australia and Japan, and pending applications in Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Korea, and Russia with claims directed to the use of Ampion for the treatment of degenerative joint diseases in a multi-dose treatment regimen. The standard 20-year expiration for patents in this family will be in 2035. 

The sixth family includes a pending U.S. application and pending applications in Europe and Hong Kong with claims directed to the use of Ampion in the absence of a cyclooxygenase-2 (“COX-2”) antagonist. The standard 20-year expiration for patents in this family will be in 2036. 

The seventh family includes a pending U.S. application with claims directed to the use of N-acetyl-kynurenine for treatment of T-cell mediated diseases, degenerative joint disease and diseases mediated by platelet activating factor and composition of matter. The standard 20-year expiration for patents in this family will be in 2037.
​
The eighth family includes a pending U.S. application and issued patents in China, Japan and Europe (validated in Germany, Great Britain, and France) with claims directed to the use of DA-DKP to treat conditions, including respiratory conditions, mediated by vascular hyperpermeability. The standard 20-year expiration for patents in this family will be in 2031.
​
The ninth family includes a pending U.S. provisional application with claims directed to the use of DA-DKP to treat conditions, including respiratory conditions, mediated by vascular hyperpermeability. The standard 20-year expiration for patents in this family will be in 2031. 
​
Barriers to Entry – General
We also maintain trade secrets and proprietary know-how that we seek to protect through confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements and other controls over confidential information. We have sought U.S. and foreign patent protection for our therapeutic product for multiple indications. These patents may not provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential and proprietary information. If we do 

15




not adequately protect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, our competitive position and business prospects could be materially harmed.
The patent positions of companies such as ours involve complex legal and factual questions and, therefore, their enforceability cannot be predicted with any certainty. Our issued patents, and those that may be issued to us in the future, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under the patents may not provide us with meaningful protection or competitive advantages. Our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us, which could offset any advantages we might otherwise realize from our intellectual property. Furthermore, even if Ampion receives regulatory approval, the time required for development, testing, and regulatory review could mean that protection afforded to us by our patents may only remain in effect for a short period after commercialization. The expiration of patents we hold could adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize our biologic, thus harming our operating results and financial position.
We will be able to protect our proprietary intellectual property rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that such rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. If we must litigate to protect our intellectual property from infringement, we may incur substantial costs and our officers may be forced to devote significant time to litigation-related matters. The laws of certain foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
Our pending patent applications, or those we may file or license from third parties in the future, may not result in patents being issued. Until a patent is issued, the claims covered by an application for patent may be narrowed or removed entirely, thus depriving us of adequate protection. As a result, we may face unanticipated competition, or conclude that without patent rights the risk of bringing Ampion to market exceeds the returns we are likely to obtain. We are generally aware of the scientific research being conducted in the areas in which we focus our research and development efforts, but patent applications filed by others are maintained in secrecy for at least 18 months after filing and, in some cases in the U.S., until the patent is issued. The publication of discoveries in scientific literature often occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made. As a result, it is possible that patent applications for products similar to our biologic candidate may have already been filed by others without our knowledge. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights, and it is possible that development of Ampion could be challenged by other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies. If we become involved in litigation concerning the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others, we may incur significant litigation or licensing expenses, be prevented from further developing or commercializing Ampion, be required to seek licenses that may not be available from third parties on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, or subject us to compensatory or punitive damage awards. Any of these consequences could materially harm our business.
Compliance with Environmental Laws
We believe we are in compliance with current environmental protection requirements that apply to us or our business. Costs attributable to environmental compliance are not currently material.
Raw Materials and Principal Suppliers 
We currently source the key components/raw materials needed to produce Ampion for our clinical trials from the following major suppliers in the industry:

​ | ​ 
--------------------+----------------------------------
Human Serum Albumin | Nova Biologics/Octapharma 
Line Sets | Sartorius Stedim and ThermoFisher
Caps/vials/stoppers | Afton Scientific 

​
We have identified some secondary suppliers and are actively seeking additional suppliers to ensure that we can source our key components/raw materials as we acknowledge that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a shortage of medical supplies (particularly 5mL vials). Due to our forecasted 12-month supply of key components/raw material, we do not currently have availability concerns.

Product Liability and Insurance
The development, manufacture, and sale of pharmaceutical products involve inherent risks of adverse side effects or reactions that can cause bodily injury or even death. Ampion, if we succeed in commercializing, could adversely affect consumers even after obtaining regulatory approval and, if so, we could be required to withdraw our product from the market or be subject to administrative or other proceedings. We obtain clinical trial liability coverage for human clinical trials, and, if we obtain regulatory approval of Ampion, we will obtain appropriate product liability insurance coverage for Ampion that we manufacture and sell for human use. The amount, nature, and pricing of such insurance coverage will likely vary due to a number of factors such as Ampion’s clinical profile, efficacy, and safety record, and other characteristics. We may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage to address our exposure to product recall or liability actions, or the cost of that coverage may be such that we will be limited in the types or amount of coverage we can obtain. Any uninsured loss we suffer could materially and adversely affect our business and financial position.
Human Capital Resources
In order to achieve the goals and expectations of our Company, it is crucial that we continue to attract and retain top talent. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to make Ampio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. a safe and rewarding workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation and benefits. For example, we pay 100% of our employees medical benefits. In addition, we have implemented a flexible paid time off (“PTO”) policy, which we believe is helpful and essential for achieving work-life balance. 
As of February 16, 2021, we had 18 full-time employees and utilized the services of a number of consultants on a temporary basis. We believe that we have a good relationship with our employees and company morale is considered high. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the pause of the AP-013 study, we eliminated two positions. However, as of December 31, 2020, our voluntary turnover was less than 15%.
Corporate History
Our predecessor, DMI Life Sciences, Inc. (“Life Sciences”), was incorporated in Delaware in December 2008. In March 2010, Life Sciences was merged with a subsidiary of Chay Enterprises, Inc. As a result of this merger, Life Sciences stockholders became the controlling stockholders of Chay Enterprises, Inc. Following the merger, we reincorporated in Delaware as Ampio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in March 2010.
