Item 1. Business 
Overview
 Ooma creates powerful connected experiences for businesses and consumers. Our smart software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) and unified-communications-as-a-service (“UCaaS”) platforms offer cloud-based communications solutions, smart security and other connected services. Our business and residential solutions deliver PureVoice high-definition voice quality, advanced functionality and integration with mobile devices, at competitive pricing and value. Our platforms help create smart workplaces and homes by providing communications, monitoring, security, automation, productivity and networking infrastructure applications.
 We drive the adoption of our platforms by providing communications solutions to the large and growing markets for business, residential and mobile users, and then facilitate growth by offering new and innovative connected services to our user base. Our customers typically adopt our platforms by making a purchase or rental of our on-premise appliances, connecting to the internet and activating services, for which they primarily pay on a monthly basis. We believe we have achieved high levels of customer satisfaction, retention and loyalty. Our business and residential phone service solutions are each ranked #1 by our customers according to surveys by PC Mag and Consumer Reports, respectively. 
 Our services rely upon the following main elements: our multi-tenant cloud service, on-premise appliances, desktop and mobile applications, end-point devices and calling platform. Ooma’s cloud provides a high-quality, secure, managed, and reliable connection integrating every element of our platforms. Our on-premise appliances incorporate both a custom-designed, Linux-based computer and a high-speed network router, with several key features, including wireless connectivity to end-point devices and custom firmware and software applications that are remotely upgradable and extensible to new services. Our desktop and mobile applications enable customers to access our product features from anywhere, and our end-point devices enable additional functionality and services. Our calling platform provides a high-volume, low-cost infrastructure for all our calling applications. Our platforms power all aspects of our business, providing the infrastructure for the communications portion of our business and enabling a number of other current and future productivity, automation, monitoring, safety, security and networking infrastructure applications and services. 
 We generate revenues primarily from the sale of subscriptions and other services for our business and residential communications solutions. We primarily offer our solutions in the U.S. and Canada. We believe that our differentiated platforms and our long-term customer relationships uniquely position us to add new connected services and exploit adjacent markets, all without significant capital investment or high customer acquisition costs to drive their adoption. We believe that our platforms are particularly well-suited to enable the delivery of connected services because it is always on, monitored and interactive. 
 We have experienced strong revenue and user growth in recent periods, growing our combined Ooma Business and Ooma Residential core users from approximately 976,000 as of January 31, 2019 to approximately 1,074,000 as of January 31, 2021. Our total revenue was $168.9 million, $151.6 million and $129.2 million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” below for additional information, including non-GAAP reconciliations. 
 We were incorporated in 2003 as a Delaware corporation and our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “OOMA.” Our corporate headquarters is located in Sunnyvale, California.

 Home Security 
 Ooma Smart Security is an innovative security and monitoring platform that utilizes the Ooma Telo device to provide do-it-yourself home security and awareness through a range of sensors including door and window, motion, garage door, water, siren, smoke, and a keypad that acts as a physical control panel for the security system.

Sales and Marketing
 Our sales and marketing objective is to grow our customer base and sell to our existing customers additional services using an integrated and multi-channel marketing approach. We continually test and refine our marketing and sales tactics to drive sales at a low customer acquisition cost. 
Marketing and Advertising
 Online. We use online marketing including search engine marketing, search engine optimization, online video, digital display advertising and social media to attract customers as they do online research for the products and services we offer. We continue to reach out to our prospect leads over time using e-mail and telemarketing until they purchase or the lead is retired. 
 Traditional. We use radio advertising to build awareness and interest for our products and services, which benefits both Ooma Business and Ooma Residential. We believe that radio advertising provides an opportunity to build the Ooma brand cost-effectively, educate prospects on Ooma’s unique combination of quality and value, and capture prospects’ attention. Businesses and consumers who hear our ads are directed to our web site, our inbound sales personnel, and/or to key retail partners. 
 Word-of-mouth. We actively mobilize our customers and brand advocates to spread word-of-mouth marketing by sharing Ooma news and information through social media and e-mail. We sell additional services to our existing customer base by offering free trials and promotional offers, as well as sending e-mail communications and leaving messages on their Ooma voicemail service. 
Sales, Customers and Backlog 
 Our business and residential products are sold through direct channels, retail, value-added resellers and other resellers. The direct channel and value-added resellers are our primary distribution channels for business customers and the direct and retail channel is our primary distribution channel for residential customers. Our direct sales force is focused on business sales and includes highly trained sales representatives located in the U.S. and Canada responding to inbound telephone calls and sales leads generated through marketing activity and our website and third-party web sites. 
 Our retail distribution includes national and regional consumer electronics, big box retailers and leading online retailers, including Amazon, Best Buy, Costco.com, Walmart.com and others. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019.
 Our service plans are generally sold as monthly subscriptions; however, certain plans are also offered as annual and multi-year subscriptions. Products are generally shipped and billed shortly after receipt of an order. We do not believe that our product backlog at any particular time is meaningful because it is not necessarily indicative of future revenue in any given period as such orders may be rescheduled or cancelled without penalty prior to shipment. The majority of our product revenue comes from orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter. 

Ooma | FY2021 Form 10-K | 5


Customer Support 
 Our primary customer support objective is to satisfy our customers and educate them on the features and benefits of our products to optimize the overall user experience. We employ an active customer management strategy in which we drive incremental revenue through cross-selling of products and services. Our customer support teams also manage the porting process for our customers as well as billing and payment activities. 
 We maintain two customer contact centers: one operated by us in Newark, California, which primarily supports our business customers, and the other operated by a third-party provider in Manila, Philippines, which primarily supports our residential customers. In addition, our offices located in Vancouver, British Columbia and Boca Raton, Florida support our enterprise customers. We utilize a variety of communication media to serve the needs of our customers including telephone, online chat, online tutorials and e-mail. 
 Engineering, Research and Development 
 We take an integrated approach to the development of our technology. Our extensive engineering resources span both hardware and software, and our business scope encompasses the entire platform from user devices such as handsets to cloud infrastructure, giving us the ability to create unique features and services for our customers. We believe our integrated engineering and business strategy is a significant competitive advantage and makes it feasible for us to leverage our platforms to deliver a broad range of productivity, automation and infrastructure connected services. 
 We have invested significant time and resources into developing our engineering, research and development team, resulting in a group with diverse skills, ranging from digital and radio frequency hardware design to embedded software, network software, telecommunications, database architecture, operations support systems, billing, security, web design and mobile app development. Because our team develops and integrates our solutions, we are able to offer a solution that works seamlessly between software and hardware and respond to customer feedback to add in additional features and services that work across our platforms. Our team consists of a core set of engineers located primarily in the San Francisco Bay Area, augmented by development teams in a number of international locations. 
 Operations and Manufacturing 
 We currently serve the majority of our customers from three separate data center facilities located in Northern California, Texas and Virginia, where we lease space from Equinix, Inc. While our service operations are partially redundant, account provisioning and billing are operated out of the San Jose facility for most of our customers. Our network operations and carrier operations teams are responsible for designing our core routing and switching infrastructure, managing growth and maintenance (including the introduction of new services) and orchestrating vendor relationships for hosted services, IP transit and carrier services and daily operation of our cloud and other services. The design of these services, and the tools for monitoring and managing them, are developed in combination with our engineering team. 
 We primarily contract with manufacturers in China and other Asian countries to produce our on-premise appliances and end-point devices. We configure and ship to our channel partners and end users through our internal manufacturing and logistics team based in Newark, California. Our internal logistics team also manages reverse logistics for channel and warranty returns and works closely with our engineering team to develop tooling and processes that bring new products into production.

Competition
 The market for communications solutions and other connected services for business, home and mobile users is very large, complex, fragmented and defined by changing technology and customer demands. We expect competition to continue to increase in the future. We believe that the defining factors driving competition in our market include: 

• | Quality and consistency of communications services;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | Lifetime value of initial investment and ongoing cost of services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Breadth of features and capabilities;
--+--------------------------------------


• | System reliability, availability and performance;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | Speed and ease of activation, setup, and configuration;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | Ownership and control of the proprietary technology;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | Integration with multiple end-point devices and mobile solutions;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Customer satisfaction and brand loyalty; and
--+---------------------------------------------


• | Ability to effectively access reseller channels
--+------------------------------------------------

 We believe that we generally compete favorably on the basis of the factors listed above. We face competition from a broad range of providers of communications solutions and other connected services for business, home and mobile users. Some of these competitors include: 
  
• | Established communications providers, such as AT&T Inc., Comcast Corporation, Verizon Communications Inc. and Rogers Communications Inc;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other cloud-based communications companies such as RingCentral Inc., Vonage Holdings Corp, 8x8 Inc., Coredial LLC, Evolve IP LLC, Intermedia.net Inc., Dialpad Inc., Microsoft Corporation, Zoom Video Communications, Inc., and Alphabet Inc. (Google Voice); and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Traditional on-premise hardware business communications providers such as Avaya Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc. and Mitel, Inc.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 All of these companies currently or may in the future host their solutions through the cloud. We also face competition in the home security market from several established providers.

Human Capital 
 People and Culture.  We view our people and our company culture as key to our success. We aim to attract and retain talented people representing diverse perspectives and skills, who are driven by our common Ooma values: 
 We care that everyone loves their Ooma experience.
 We think big to innovate and revolutionize markets.
 We create smarter solutions that uniquely deliver both superior experiences and superior value.
 We embrace diversity of thought to make the best decisions.
 We respect that problems are best solved by fact-based discussions and positive intent.
 We choose to be a force for good in the world.
 From time-to-time, we conduct confidential company-wide surveys to capture our employees’ views of the organization, company goals and job satisfaction, which our senior leadership team reviews and acts upon, as appropriate. Our employees are encouraged to engage with company leadership and openly raise concerns and questions, including via our quarterly employee communications meeting with the CEO and senior management team.  Our management team also regularly hosts “Ask and Answer” sessions across the organization to create more opportunities for employees to communicate, share ideas and learn about Ooma.  In calendar year 2020, we were named one of the Bay Area’s “Best Places to Work” by the Silicon Valley Business Journal and the San Francisco Business Times.  
 Diversity, Equity, Inclusion (“DEI”) and Racial Justice.  Our commitment to DEI and racial justice is more than the policies and practices we develop and adhere to – it is an integral part of who we are and how we operate. We believe it is our responsibility to embrace a diverse employee workforce, build a strong and caring culture of inclusion and lead with both passion and compassion. During fiscal 2021, we formed an internal committee led by our Chief Financial Officer, as well as joined the Silicon Valley Leadership Group’s DEI committee, to continue to support and enhance our practice of DEI and racial justice values. For example, we increased gender and ethnic diversity on our Board of Directors in January 2021. We believe a diverse and inclusive workforce serves to enrich our employee experience. 
 Compensation and Benefits.  We aim to provide our employees competitive salaries and benefit programs that help meet the varying needs of our workforce. These programs include an employee stock purchase plan, equity awards and bonuses, a 401(k) retirement plan with a company match, healthcare benefits, paid time off and family leave, and flexible work arrangements. We conduct annual benchmarking to assess our compensation and benefit programs against those of our peers.  
 Workplace Health and Safety. We are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace for our workforce. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes in compliance with local regulations. This includes currently requiring most of our employees to work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for personnel continuing critical on-site work.
 Community Support.  We believe in giving back and promoting community outreach through corporate giving and employee volunteerism. Through our “Ooma Giving Back” program, we partner with certain non-profit organizations to help support several local communities. 
Ooma | FY2021 Form 10-K | 8


Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties, as well as other contractual protections to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We control access to our software, documentation and other proprietary information, and our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright laws. 
 As of January 31, 2021, we had 34 issued patents and 14 patent applications pending in the U.S. and 7 patent applications pending in foreign jurisdictions, all of which are associated with U.S. applications. Our issued patents will expire approximately between 2031 and 2038.  We cannot assure you whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Any issued patents may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalidated, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them. We are also a party to various license agreements with third parties who typically grant us the right to use certain third-party technology in conjunction with our products and services, or to integrate software into our products, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms. Despite the foregoing protections, unauthorized parties may attempt to misappropriate our rights or to copy or obtain and use our proprietary technology to develop products and services with the same functionality as ours. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult and enforcing our intellectual property rights is expensive and uncertain. 
 Although our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights, we believe the technological and creative skills of our personnel, the development of new features and functionality and frequent enhancements to our products and services are the primary methods of establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position. 
 Employees and Contractors 
 As of January 31, 2021, we had a total of 357 full-time employees, the majority of whom are located in the U.S. and Canada. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Additionally, we utilize third party contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. 
Regulatory Matters 
 Traditional telephone service historically has been subject to extensive federal and state regulation, while Internet services generally have been subject to less regulation. Because some elements of VoIP resemble the services provided by traditional telephone companies and others resemble the services provided by internet service providers. The Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), the U.S. Congress, and various regulatory bodies in the states and in foreign countries have imposed regulations on VoIP providers and are continuing to consider new regulatory requirements on VoIP services. 
Federal Regulation
 As a provider of internet communications services, we are subject to a number of FCC regulations. Among others, these regulatory obligations include: contributing to the Federal Universal Service Fund (“USF”), the Telecommunications Relay Service Fund and federal programs related to phone number administration; providing access to E-911 services; protecting customer information; and porting phone numbers upon a valid customer request. If we do not comply with any current or future rules or regulations that apply to our business, we could be subject to substantial fines and penalties, may have to restructure our service offerings, exit certain markets or raise the price of our services, any of which could ultimately harm our business and results of operations. 
State Regulation
 The FCC has preempted much regulation of internet voice communications services. However, a number of states have ruled that non-nomadic internet voice communications services may or do fall within the definition of “telecommunications services” or are otherwise within state telecommunications regulatory jurisdiction and therefore those states assert that they have authority to regulate the service. Although no states currently require certification for nomadic internet voice communications service providers, a number of states have imposed certain traditional telecommunications requirements on such services. For example, a number of states require us to contribute to state USF and E-911 and pay other surcharges, which are passed through to our customers, while others are actively considering extending their public policy programs to include the services we provide. We expect that state public utility commissions will continue their attempts to apply state telecommunications regulations to internet voice communications services like ours. 
 Ooma | FY2021 Form 10-K | 9

International Regulation
 As we expand internationally, we are subject to laws and regulations in the countries in which we offer our services. Regulatory treatment of internet communications services outside the U.S. varies from country to country, is often unclear, and may be more onerous than imposed on our services in the U.S. In Canada, our service is regulated by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (“CRTC”) which, among other things, imposes requirements similar to the U.S. related to the provision of E-911 services in all areas of Canada where the traditional telephone carrier offers such 911 services. Our regulatory obligations in foreign jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on our ability to expand internationally, and on the use of our services in international locations. 
 See “Risks Related to Regulatory and Tax Matters” in Item 1A. Risk Factors below for more information.
