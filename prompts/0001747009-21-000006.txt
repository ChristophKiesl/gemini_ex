Item 1.        Business
Overview of the Company
Equitrans Midstream is one of the largest natural gas gatherers in the U.S. and holds a significant transmission footprint in the Appalachian Basin. Equitrans Midstream, a Pennsylvania corporation, became an independent, publicly traded company on November 12, 2018, as a result of the Separation (defined below).
The Separation. On November 12, 2018, Equitrans Midstream, EQT and, for certain limited purposes, EQT Production Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of EQT, entered into a separation and distribution agreement (the Separation and Distribution Agreement), pursuant to which, among other things, EQT effected the separation of its midstream business, which was composed of the assets and liabilities of the separately-operated natural gas gathering, transmission and storage and water services operations of EQT (the Midstream Business), from EQT's upstream business, which was composed of the natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids development, production and sales and commercial operations of EQT (the Separation), to Equitrans Midstream, and distributed 80.1% of the then-outstanding shares of common stock, no par value, of Equitrans Midstream (Equitrans Midstream common stock) to EQT shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 1, 2018 (the Distribution). As part of the Separation, EQT retained the remaining 19.9% of the then-outstanding shares in Equitrans Midstream. 
In connection with the Separation, the Company acquired control of the entities conducting the Midstream Business. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the entities conducting the Midstream Business.
The Company's Post-Separation Relationship with EQT. The Company and EQT are separate companies with separate management teams and separate boards of directors. Although they operate separately, due to the approximately 5.8% of Equitrans Midstream's outstanding shares of common stock held by EQT as of December 31, 2020, the Company and EQT are characterized for certain purposes as related parties. In connection with the Separation and Distribution, the Company and EQT executed the Separation and Distribution Agreement and various other agreements to effect the Separation. See Notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the relationship between the Company and EQT subsequent to the Separation.
EQGP Unit Purchases and Limited Call Right. On November 29, 2018, the Company entered into written agreements (the Unit Purchase Agreements) with certain investors owning an aggregate of 15,364,421 common units representing limited partner interests in EQGP (EQGP common units) for $20.00 per EQGP common unit that closed through a series of transactions ending on January 3, 2019 for an aggregate purchase price of $307.3 million (collectively, the EQGP Unit Purchases). 
On December 31, 2018, the Company exercised a limited call right (the Limited Call Right) under EQGP's partnership agreement, pursuant to which, on January 10, 2019, the Company closed on the acquisition of the remaining 11,097,287 outstanding EQGP common units not owned by the Company or its affiliates for an aggregate purchase price of $221.9 million (such acquisition, together with the EQGP Unit Purchases, the EQGP Buyout), and EQGP became an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the EQGP Buyout.
EQM IDR Transaction. On February 22, 2019, Equitrans Midstream completed a simplification transaction pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 13, 2019 (the IDR Merger Agreement), by and among Equitrans Midstream and certain related parties, pursuant to which, among other things, (i) Equitrans Merger Sub, LP merged with and into EQGP (the Merger) with EQGP continuing as the surviving limited partnership and a wholly owned subsidiary of EQM, and (ii) each of (a) the IDRs in EQM, (b) the economic portion of the general partner interest in EQM and (c) the issued and outstanding EQGP common units were canceled, and, as consideration for such cancellation, certain affiliates of the Company received on a pro rata basis 80,000,000 newly-issued common units representing limited partner interests in EQM (EQM common units) and 7,000,000 newly-issued Class B units representing limited partner interests in EQM (Class B units), and EQGP Services, LLC (the EQM General Partner) retained the non-economic general partner interest in EQM (such transactions, collectively, the EQM IDR Transaction). Additionally, as part of the EQM IDR Transaction, the 21,811,643 EQM common units held by EQGP were canceled and 21,811,643 EQM common units were issued pro rata to certain subsidiaries of the Company. As a result of the EQM IDR Transaction, the EQM General Partner replaced EQM Midstream Services, LLC as the general partner of EQM. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the EQM IDR Transaction.
EQM Series A Preferred Units. On March 13, 2019, EQM entered into a Convertible Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement, together with Joinder Agreements entered into on March 18, 2019, with certain investors (such investors, collectively, the Investors) to issue and sell in a private placement (the Private Placement) an aggregate of 24,605,291 Series A Perpetual 
Convertible Preferred Units (EQM Series A Preferred Units) representing limited partner interests in EQM for a cash purchase price of $48.77 per EQM Series A Preferred Unit, resulting in total gross proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion. The net proceeds from the Private Placement were used in part to fund the purchase price in the Bolt-on Acquisition (defined in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements) and to pay certain fees and expenses related to the Bolt-on Acquisition, and the remainder was used for general partnership purposes. The Private Placement closed concurrently with the closing of the Bolt-on Acquisition on April 10, 2019. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the EQM Series A Preferred Units, none of which remain outstanding and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statement for further information on the Bolt-on Acquisition.
EQM Merger. On June 17, 2020, pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 26, 2020 (the EQM Merger Agreement), by and among the Company, EQM LP Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (EQM LP), LS Merger Sub, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of EQM LP (Merger Sub), EQM and the EQM General Partner, Merger Sub merged with and into EQM (the EQM Merger), with EQM continuing and surviving as an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Upon consummation of the EQM Merger, the Company acquired all of the outstanding EQM common units that the Company and its subsidiaries did not already own. Following the closing of the EQM Merger, EQM was no longer a publicly traded entity. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the EQM Merger.
Preferred Restructuring Agreement. On February 26, 2020, the Company and EQM entered into a Preferred Restructuring Agreement (the Restructuring Agreement) with all of the Investors pursuant to which, at the effective time of the EQM Merger (the Effective Time): (i) EQM redeemed $600 million aggregate principal amount of the Investors' EQM Series A Preferred Units issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Restructuring Closing (defined below), which occurred substantially concurrent with the closing of the EQM Merger, for cash at 101% of the EQM Series A Preferred Unit purchase price of $48.77 per such unit (the EQM Series A Preferred Unit Purchase Price) plus any accrued and unpaid distribution amounts and partial period distribution amounts, and (ii) immediately following such redemption, each remaining issued and outstanding EQM Series A Preferred Unit was exchanged for 2.44 shares of a newly authorized and created series of preferred stock, without par value, of Equitrans Midstream, convertible into Equitrans Midstream common stock (the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares) on a one for one basis, in each case, in connection with the occurrence of the “Series A Change of Control” (as defined in the Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of EQM (as amended, the Former EQM Partnership Agreement)) that occurred upon the closing of the EQM Merger (collectively, the Restructuring and, the closing of the Restructuring, the Restructuring Closing). See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the Restructuring Agreement and the Restructuring.
The EQT Global GGA. On February 26, 2020 (the EQT Global GGA Effective Date), the Company entered into a Gas Gathering and Compression Agreement (the EQT Global GGA) with EQT for the provision by the Company of certain gas gathering services to EQT in the Marcellus and Utica Shales of Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Pursuant to the EQT Global GGA, EQT is subject to an initial annual MVC of 3.0 Bcf per day that gradually steps up to 4.0 Bcf per day for several years following the full in-service date of the MVP. The EQT Global GGA runs from the EQT Global GGA Effective Date through December 31, 2035, and will renew annually thereafter unless terminated by EQT or the Company pursuant to its terms. Pursuant to the EQT Global GGA, the Company has certain obligations to build connections to connect EQT wells to its gathering system, which are subject to geographical limitations in relation to the dedicated area in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, as well as the distance of such connections to the Company's then-existing gathering system. In addition to the fees related to gathering services, the EQT Global GGA provides for potential cash bonus payments payable by EQT to the Company during the period beginning on the first day of the calendar quarter in which the MVP in-service date occurs through the earlier of the twelfth calendar quarter from that point or the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2024 (the Henry Hub cash bonus payment provision). The potential cash bonus payments are conditioned upon the quarterly average of certain Henry Hub natural gas prices exceeding certain price thresholds.
The gathering MVC fees payable by EQT to the Company set forth in the EQT Global GGA are subject to potential reductions for certain contract years as set forth in the EQT Global GGA, conditioned upon the in-service date of the MVP, which provide for estimated aggregate fee relief of approximately $270 million in the first year after the in-service date of the MVP, approximately $230 million in the second year after the in-service date of the MVP and approximately $35 million in the third year after the in-service date of the MVP. In addition, if the MVP in-service date has not occurred by January 1, 2022, EQT has an option, exercisable for a period of twelve months (or such shorter period if the in-service date of the MVP occurs), to forgo approximately $145 million of the gathering fee relief in the first year after the MVP in-service date and approximately $90 million of the gathering fee relief in the second year after the MVP in-service date in exchange for a cash payment from the Company to EQT in the amount of approximately $196 million (the EQT Cash Option). See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the EQT Global GGA.
Credit Letter Agreement. On February 26, 2020, in connection with the execution of the EQT Global GGA, the Company and EQT entered into a letter agreement (the Credit Letter Agreement) pursuant to which, among other things, (a) the Company agreed to relieve certain credit posting requirements for EQT, in an amount up to approximately $250 million, under its commercial agreements with the Company, subject to EQT maintaining a minimum credit rating from two of three rating agencies of (i) Ba3 with Moody’s Investors Service (Moody's), (ii) BB- with S&P Global Ratings (S&P) and (iii) BB- with Fitch Investor Services (Fitch) and (b) the Company agreed to use commercially reasonable good faith efforts to negotiate similar credit support arrangements for EQT in respect of its commitments to the MVP Joint Venture.
Water Services Letter Agreement. On February 26, 2020, the Company entered into a letter agreement with EQT, pursuant to which EQT agreed to utilize the Company for the provision of water services in Pennsylvania under existing water services agreements and new water services agreements if negotiated between the parties (such letter agreement, the Water Services Letter Agreement). The Water Services Letter Agreement is effective as of the first day of the first month following the MVP in-service date and will expire on the fifth anniversary of such date. During each year of the Water Services Letter Agreement, EQT agreed that fixed MVC fees payable to the Company for water services in Pennsylvania incurred on a volumetric basis, provided in accordance with existing agreements and new agreements entered into between the parties pursuant to the Water Services Letter Agreement (or the related agreements), will be equal to or greater than $60 million per year.
Share Purchase Agreements. On February 26, 2020, the Company entered into two share purchase agreements (the Share Purchase Agreements) with EQT, pursuant to which the Company agreed to (i) purchase 4,769,496 shares of Equitrans Midstream common stock (the Cash Shares) from EQT in exchange for approximately $46 million in cash, (ii) purchase 20,530,256 shares of Equitrans Midstream common stock (the Rate Relief Shares and, together with the Cash Shares, the Share Purchases) from EQT in exchange for a promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $196 million (which EQT subsequently assigned to EQM as consideration for certain commercial terms under the EQT Global GGA), and (iii) pay EQT cash in the amount of approximately $7 million (the Cash Amount). On March 5, 2020, the Company completed the Share Purchases and paid the Cash Amount. The Company used proceeds from the EQM Credit Facility (defined in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements) to fund the purchase of the Cash Shares and to pay the Cash Amount in addition to other uses of proceeds. After the closing of the Share Purchases, the Company retired the Cash Shares and the Rate Relief Shares. On September 29, 2020, the Company made a prepayment to EQM of all principal, interest, fees and other obligations outstanding under the promissory note EQT assigned to EQM and the promissory note was terminated. 
The following diagram depicts the Company's organizational and ownership structure as of December 31, 2020: 
Overview of Operations
The Company provides midstream services to its customers through its three primary assets: the gathering system, which includes predominantly dry gas gathering systems of high-pressure gathering lines; the transmission system, which includes FERC-regulated interstate pipelines and storage systems; and the water service system, which consists of water pipelines, impoundment facilities, pumping stations, take point facilities and measurement facilities that support well completion activities and collect flowback and produced water for recycling or disposal. 
As of December 31, 2020, the Company provided a majority of its natural gas gathering, transmission and storage services under long-term contracts that generally include fixed monthly reservation fees or MVCs. The Company maintains a stable cash flow profile, with approximately 66% of the Company's revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 generated from firm reservation fees. The percentage of the Company's revenues that are generated by firm reservation fees is expected to increase in future years as a result of the 15-year term EQT Global GGA, which includes an MVC that became effective on April 1, 2020 of 3.0 Bcf per day and gradually steps up to 4.0 Bcf per day for several years following the full in-service date of the MVP project, and the Hammerhead gathering agreement (which is subject to a pending dispute with EQT), which includes a 1.2 Bcf per day firm capacity commitment. These contract structures enhance the stability of the Company's cash flows and limits its direct exposure to commodity price risk. 
The Company's operations are focused primarily in southwestern Pennsylvania, northern West Virginia and southeastern Ohio, which are prolific resource development areas in the natural gas shale plays known as the Marcellus and Utica Shales. These regions are also the primary operating areas of EQT, the Company's largest customer as of December 31, 2020. EQT accounted for approximately 64% of the Company's revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The following is a map of the Company's gathering, transmission and storage and water services operations as of December 31, 2020.

Business Segments
The Company reports its operations in three segments that reflect its three lines of business: Gathering, Transmission and Water. These segments include all of the Company's operations. For discussion of the composition of the three segments, see Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
The Company's three business segments correspond to the Company's three primary assets: the gathering system, transmission and storage system and water service system. The following table summarizes the composition of the Company's operating revenues by business segment.

 | Years Ended December 31,
 | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018
Gathering operating revenues | 67 | % | | 71 | % | 67 | %
Transmission operating revenues | 26 | % | | 24 | % | 26 | %
Water operating revenues | 7 | % | | 5 | % | 7 | %

The Company's largest customer is EQT, which was the largest natural gas producer in the United States based on average daily sales volumes as of December 31, 2020. EQT accounted for approximately 64%, 69% and 74% of the Company's total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
Gathering Customers. For the year ended December 31, 2020, EQT accounted for approximately 65% of Gathering's revenues. Subject to certain exceptions and limitations, as of December 31, 2020, Gathering had acreage dedications (inclusive of acreage dedications to Eureka Midstream Holdings, LLC (Eureka Midstream), a joint venture in which the Company has a 60% interest and that owns a 190-mile gathering header pipeline system in Ohio and West Virginia that services both dry Utica and wet Marcellus Shale production) through which the Company has the right to elect to gather all natural gas produced from wells under an area covering (i) approximately 475,000 gross acres in Pennsylvania pursuant to agreements with EQT, including the EQT Global GGA, and agreements with certain other third parties, (ii) approximately 344,000 gross acres in Ohio pursuant to agreements with EQT and other third parties and (iii) approximately 370,000 gross acres in West Virginia pursuant to the EQT Global GGA and agreements with certain other third parties. 
The Company provides gathering services in two manners: firm service and interruptible service. Firm service contracts are typically long-term and can include firm reservation fees, which are fixed, monthly charges for the guaranteed reservation of pipeline access. Revenues under firm reservation fees also include fixed volumetric charges under MVCs. As of December 31, 2020, the gathering system had total contracted firm reservation capacity (including contracted MVCs) of approximately 7.0 Bcf per day (inclusive of Eureka Midstream contracted capacity), which included contracted firm reservation capacity of approximately 1.8 Bcf per day associated with the Company's high-pressure header pipelines (including 1.2 Bcf per day under the Hammerhead gathering agreement, which is currently subject to a dispute with EQT). Including future capacity expected from expansion projects that are not yet fully constructed for which the Company has executed firm contracts, the gathering system had total contracted firm reservation capacity (including contracted MVCs) of approximately 8.0 Bcf per day (inclusive of Eureka Midstream contracted capacity) as of December 31, 2020, which included contracted firm reservation capacity of approximately 1.8 Bcf per day associated with the Company's high-pressure header pipelines (including 1.2 Bcf per day under the Hammerhead gathering agreement, which is currently subject to a dispute with EQT). Volumetric-based fees can also be charged under firm contracts for each firm volume gathered as well as for volumes gathered in excess of the firm contracted volume, if system capacity exists. Based on total projected contractual revenues, including projected contractual revenues from future capacity expected from expansion projects that are not yet fully constructed for which the Company has executed firm contracts, the Company's firm gathering contracts had a weighted average remaining term of approximately 15 years as of December 31, 2020. 
Interruptible service contracts include volumetric-based fees, which are charges for the volume of natural gas gathered and generally do not guarantee access to the pipeline. These contracts can be short- or long-term.
The Company generally does not take title to the natural gas gathered for its customers but retains a percentage of wellhead gas receipts to recover natural gas used to power its compressor stations and meet other requirements on the Company's gathering systems.
See “Gulfport Bankruptcy” under the caption “Outlook” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a discussion of the Gulfport Energy Corporation (Gulfport) bankruptcy proceedings. 
Transmission Customers. For the year ended December 31, 2020, EQT accounted for approximately 58% of Transmission's throughput and approximately 53% of Transmission's revenues. As of December 31, 2020, Transmission had an acreage dedication from EQT through which the Company had the right to elect to transport all gas produced from wells drilled by EQT under an area covering approximately 60,000 acres in Allegheny, Washington and Greene Counties in Pennsylvania and Wetzel, Marion, Taylor, Tyler, Doddridge, Harrison and Lewis Counties in West Virginia. The Company's other customers include LDCs, marketers, producers and commercial and industrial users. The Company's transmission and storage system provides customers with access to adjacent markets in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio and to the Mid-Atlantic, Northeastern, Midwestern and Gulf Coast markets through interconnect points with major interstate pipelines.
The Company provides transmission and storage services in two manners: firm service and interruptible service. Firm service contracts are typically long-term and can include firm reservation fees, which are fixed, monthly charges for the guaranteed reservation of pipeline and storage capacity. Volumetric-based fees can also be charged under firm contracts for firm volume transported or stored as well as for volumes transported or stored in excess of the firm contracted volume, if there is system capacity. Customers are not assured capacity or service for volumes in excess of the firm contracted volume as such volumes have the same priority as interruptible service. Including future capacity expected from expansion projects that are not yet fully constructed for which the Company has executed firm transmission contracts, approximately 4.4 Bcf per day of transmission capacity, excluding, in the aggregate, 2.3 Bcf per day of firm capacity commitments associated with the MVP and MVP Southgate projects, and 30.5 Bcf of storage capacity were subscribed under firm transmission and firm storage contracts, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. Based on total projected contractual revenues, including projected contractual revenues from future capacity expected from expansion projects that are not yet fully constructed for which the Company has executed firm contracts, the Company's firm transmission and storage contracts had a weighted average remaining term of approximately 14 years as of December 31, 2020.
Interruptible service contracts include volumetric-based fees, which are charges for the volume of natural gas transported and generally do not guarantee access to the pipeline or storage facility. These contracts can be short- or long-term. Customers with interruptible service contracts are not assured capacity or service on the transmission and storage systems. To the extent that capacity reserved by customers with firm service contracts is not fully used or excess capacity exists, the transmission and storage systems can allocate capacity to interruptible services. The Company generally does not take title to the natural gas transported or stored for its customers.
As of December 31, 2020, approximately 97% of Transmission's contracted firm transmission capacity was subscribed by customers under negotiated rate agreements under its tariff, while the remainder was subscribed at discounted rates under its tariff, which are rates below the recourse rates and above a minimum level. As of December 31, 2020, Transmission did not have any contracted firm transmission capacity subscribed at recourse rates under its tariff, which are the maximum rates an interstate pipeline may charge for its services under its tariff. See also “FERC Regulation” under “Regulatory Environment” below and “Our natural gas gathering, transmission and storage services are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local regulatory authorities. Changes or additional regulatory measures adopted by such authorities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends.” included in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" for additional information.
Water Customers. For the year ended December 31, 2020, EQT accounted for approximately 90% of Water's revenues. The Company has the exclusive right to provide fluid handling services to certain EQT-operated wells through 2029 (and thereafter such right continues on a month-to-month basis) within areas of dedication in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania and Belmont County, Ohio, including the delivery of fresh water for well completion operations and the collection and recycling or disposal of flowback and produced water. The Company also provides water services to other customers operating in the Marcellus and Utica Shales. The Company's water service revenues are primarily generated under variable price per volume contracts. The fees charged by the Company are generally tiered and, thus, are lower on a per gallon basis once certain thresholds are met. 
See also “Water Services Letter Agreement” above for additional information on the Company's Water customers.
The Company's Assets
Gathering Assets. As of December 31, 2020, the gathering system, inclusive of Eureka Midstream's gathering system, included approximately 1,130 miles of high-pressure gathering lines and 132 compressor units with compression of approximately 485,000 horsepower and multiple interconnect points with the Company's transmission and storage system and to other interstate pipelines. The gathering system also included approximately 910 miles of FERC-regulated, low-pressure gathering lines. 
Transmission and Storage Assets. As of December 31, 2020, the transmission and storage system included approximately 950 miles of FERC-regulated, interstate pipelines that have interconnect points to seven interstate pipelines and multiple LDCs. As 
of December 31, 2020, the transmission and storage system was supported by 42 compressor units, with total throughput capacity of approximately 4.4 Bcf per day and compression of approximately 136,000 horsepower, and 18 associated natural gas storage reservoirs, which had a peak withdrawal capacity of approximately 900 MMcf per day and a working gas capacity of approximately 43 Bcf.
Water Assets. As of December 31, 2020, the water system included approximately 200 miles of pipeline that deliver fresh water from the Monongahela River, the Ohio River, local reservoirs and several regional waterways. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, the water system assets included 24 fresh water impoundment facilities. 
Developments, Market Trends and Competitive Conditions
Strategy. The Company's strategically-located assets overlay core acreage in the Appalachian Basin. The location of the Company's assets allows its producer customers to access major demand markets in the U.S. The Company is one of the largest natural gas gatherers in the U.S., and its largest customer, EQT, was the largest natural gas producer in the U.S. based on average daily sales volumes as of December 31, 2020. The Company maintains a stable cash flow profile, with approximately 66% of its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 generated from firm reservation fees. Further, as discussed above, the percentage of the Company's revenues that are generated by firm reservation fees is expected to increase in future years as a result of the 15-year term EQT Global GGA, which includes an MVC that became effective on April 1, 2020 of 3.0 Bcf per day and gradually steps up to 4.0 Bcf per day for several years following the full in-service date of the MVP project. This contract structure enhances the stability of the Company's cash flows and limits its direct exposure to commodity price risk.
The Company's principal strategy is to achieve greater scale and scope and enhance the durability of its financial strength, which the Company expects will drive future growth and investment. The Company is implementing its strategy by leveraging its existing assets, executing on its growth projects (including through potential expansion and extension opportunities), focusing on ESG initiatives, and, where appropriate, seeking and executing on strategically-aligned acquisition and joint venture opportunities and other strategic transactions, while strengthening its balance sheet through:
•highly predictable cash flows backed by firm reservation fees;
•actions to de-lever its balance sheet;
•disciplined capital spending; 
•operating cost control; and 
•an appropriate dividend policy. 
As part of its approach to organic growth, the Company is focused on its projects and assets outlined below, many of which are supported by contracts with firm capacity or MVC commitments. The Company believes that this approach will enable the Company to achieve its strategic goals.
The Company expects that the MVP project, together with the Hammerhead pipeline and Equitrans, L.P. Expansion Project (EEP), will primarily drive the Company's organic growth and that its future growth also will be supported by the MVP Southgate project and the water services business, as discussed in further detail below.
•Mountain Valley Pipeline. The MVP is being constructed by a joint venture among the Company and affiliates of each of NextEra Energy, Inc., Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison), AltaGas Ltd. and RGC Resources, Inc. As of December 31, 2020, the Company owned an approximate 46.2% interest in the MVP project and will operate the MVP. The MVP is an estimated 300-mile, 42-inch diameter natural gas interstate pipeline with a targeted capacity of 2.0 Bcf per day that will span from the Company's existing transmission and storage system in Wetzel County, West Virginia to Pittsylvania County, Virginia, providing access to the growing southeast demand markets. The MVP Joint Venture has secured a total of 2.0 Bcf per day of firm capacity commitments at 20-year terms. Additional shippers have expressed interest in the MVP project and the MVP Joint Venture is evaluating an expansion opportunity that could add approximately 0.5 Bcf per day of capacity through the installation of incremental compression. The MVP Joint Venture is also evaluating other future pipeline extension projects.
In October 2017, the FERC issued the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (the Certificate) for the MVP. In the first quarter of 2018, the MVP Joint Venture received limited notice to proceed with certain construction activities from the FERC and commenced construction. Following a comprehensive review of all outstanding stream and wetland crossings across the approximately 300-mile MVP project route, on February 19, 2021, the MVP Joint Venture submitted (i) a joint application package to each of the Huntington, Pittsburgh and Norfolk Districts of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Army Corps) that requests an individual permit from the Army Corps to cross certain 
streams and wetlands utilizing open cut techniques (the Army Corps Individual Permit) and (ii) an application to amend the Certificate that seeks FERC authority to cross certain streams and wetlands utilizing alternative trenchless construction methods. 
The Company believes this modified approach to seeking authorization to cross all remaining streams and wetlands on the project route, in lieu of continuing to pursue authority under Nationwide Permit 12 and the formerly pending FERC request to amend the Certificate to utilize trenchless construction methods to cross all streams and wetlands for the first 77 miles of the project route, presents the most efficient and effective path to project completion. The Company continues to target a full in-service date for the MVP project in late 2021 at a total project cost of $5.8 billion to $6.0 billion (excluding AFUDC).
As discussed under "The regulatory approval process for the construction of new midstream assets is very challenging, and decisions by regulatory and judicial authorities in pending or potential proceedings could impact our or the MVP Joint Venture's ability to obtain or maintain in effect all approvals and authorizations necessary to complete certain projects on the targeted time frame or at all or our ability to achieve the expected investment returns on the projects." included in "Item 1A. Risk Factors", there are pending legal and regulatory challenges to or otherwise affecting certain aspects of the MVP project that must be resolved before the project can be completed, and the MVP Joint Venture is working to resolve these challenges. In order to complete the project in accordance with the targeted full in-service date and cost, the MVP Joint Venture must, among other things: (i) timely receive the Army Corps Individual Permit, which will require Section 401 water quality certification approvals or waivers from each of the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality and certain other state-level approvals; (ii) maintain and, as applicable, timely receive required authorizations, including authorization to proceed with construction, related to the Jefferson National Forest from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) and the FERC; (iii) timely receive authorization from the FERC to utilize alternative trenchless construction methods for certain stream and wetland crossings; (iv) continue to have available the orders previously issued by the FERC modifying its prior stop work orders and extending the MVP Joint Venture’s prescribed time to complete the MVP project; (v) timely receive authorization from the FERC to complete construction work in the portion of the project route currently remaining subject to the FERC’s previous stop work order; and (vi) continue to be authorized to work under the Biological Opinion and Incidental Take Statement issued by the United States Department of the Interior’s Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) for the MVP project, in each case including the continued effectiveness of any such foregoing or other authorizations notwithstanding any pending or future challenge thereto. See the discussion of litigation and regulatory related delays affecting the completion of the MVP project set forth in "Item 3. Legal Proceedings". 
On November 4, 2019, Con Edison exercised an option to cap its investment in the MVP project at approximately $530 million (excluding AFUDC). The Company and NextEra Energy, Inc. are obligated, and RGC Resources, Inc., another member of the MVP Joint Venture owning an interest in the MVP project, has opted, to fund the shortfall in Con Edison's capital contributions on a pro rata basis. Such funding by the Company and funding by other members has and will correspondingly increase the Company's and such other members' respective interests in the MVP project and decrease Con Edison's interest in the MVP project. As a result, based on the midpoint of the project's $5.8 billion to $6.0 billion (excluding AFUDC) targeted cost, the Company's ownership interest in the MVP project will progressively increase from approximately 46.2% to approximately 47.6%. 
Through December 31, 2020, based on the midpoint of the MVP project's targeted cost, the Company had funded approximately $2.2 billion of its estimated total capital contributions of approximately $2.9 billion (inclusive of additional contributions required due to the Con Edison cap described above), including approximately $140 million to $150 million in excess of the Company's ownership interest. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company made approximately $268 million of capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture for the MVP project. For 2021, the Company expects to make total capital contributions of $670 million to $720 million to the MVP Joint Venture for purposes of the MVP project, depending on the timing of construction of the project.
•Wellhead Gathering Expansion Projects and Hammerhead Pipeline. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company invested approximately $345 million in gathering projects (inclusive of capital expenditures related to the noncontrolling interest in Eureka Midstream). For 2021, the Company expects to invest approximately $325 million to $355 million in gathering projects (inclusive of expected capital expenditures related to the noncontrolling interest in Eureka Midstream). The primary projects include infrastructure expansion of core development areas in the Marcellus and Utica Shales in southwestern Pennsylvania, southeastern Ohio and northern West Virginia for EQT, Range Resources Corporation (Range Resources) and other producers.
The Hammerhead pipeline is a 1.6 Bcf per day gathering header pipeline that is primarily designed to connect natural gas produced in Pennsylvania and West Virginia to the MVP, Texas Eastern Transmission and Dominion Transmission, is supported by a 20-year term, 1.2 Bcf per day, firm capacity commitment from EQT, and cost approximately $540 million. The Company believes the Hammerhead pipeline was placed in-service effective August 1, 2020. See "Outlook" in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for more information on the Hammerhead pipeline.
•Transmission Projects and Equitrans Expansion Project. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company invested approximately $45 million in transmission projects, including the EEP. For 2021, the Company expects to invest approximately $25 million to $45 million in transmission projects.
The EEP is designed to provide north-to-south capacity on the mainline Equitrans, L.P. transmission system, including primarily for deliveries to the MVP. A portion of the EEP commenced operations with interruptible service in the third quarter of 2019. The EEP provides capacity of approximately 600 MMcf per day and offers access to several markets through interconnects with Texas Eastern Transmission, Dominion Transmission and Columbia Gas Transmission. Once the MVP is fully placed in service, firm transportation agreements for 550 MMcf per day of capacity will commence under 20-year terms.
•MVP Southgate Project. In April 2018, the MVP Joint Venture announced the MVP Southgate project, a proposed 75-mile interstate pipeline that will extend from the MVP at Pittsylvania County, Virginia to new delivery points in Rockingham and Alamance Counties, North Carolina. The MVP Southgate project is backed by a 300 MMcf per day firm capacity commitment from Dominion Energy North Carolina. As designed, the MVP Southgate project has expansion capabilities that could provide up to 900 MMcf per day of total capacity. The MVP Southgate project is estimated to cost a total of approximately $450 million to $500 million, which is expected to be spent primarily in 2022. The Company expects to fund approximately $225 million of the overall project cost. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company made approximately $5 million of capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture for the MVP Southgate project. For 2021, the Company expects to make capital contributions of approximately $20 million to the MVP Joint Venture for the MVP Southgate project. The Company will operate the MVP Southgate and, as of December 31, 2020, owned a 47.2% interest in the MVP Southgate project. The MVP Joint Venture submitted the MVP Southgate certificate application to the FERC in November 2018. The Final Environmental Impact Statement for the MVP Southgate project was issued on February 14, 2020. In June 2020, the FERC issued the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for the MVP Southgate; however, the FERC, while authorizing the project, directed the Office of Energy Projects not to issue a notice to proceed with construction until necessary federal permits are received for the MVP project and the Director of the Office of Energy Projects lifts the stop work order and authorizes the MVP Joint Venture to continue constructing the MVP project. On August 11, 2020, North Carolina regulators denied the MVP Southgate project's application for a Clean Water Act Section 401 Individual Water Quality Certification and Jordan Lake Riparian Buffer Authorization due to uncertainty surrounding the completion of the MVP project, which denial was appealed by the MVP Joint Venture on September 10, 2020. The MVP Southgate project is targeted to be placed in-service in 2022, which such targeted in-service date is based on, among other things, favorable and timely resolution of this and other regulatory and legal decisions and processes. See the discussion of litigation and regulatory related delays affecting the completion of the MVP Southgate project set forth in "Item 3. Legal Proceedings".
•Water Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company invested approximately $12 million in its fresh water delivery infrastructure. For 2021, the Company expects to invest approximately $20 million in the operations of its fresh water delivery infrastructure in Pennsylvania and Ohio.
Competitive Condition. Key competitors for new natural gas gathering systems include companies that own major natural gas pipelines, independent gas gatherers and integrated energy companies. When compared to the Company or its customers, some of the Company's competitors have greater capital resources and access to, or control of, larger natural gas supplies.
Competition for natural gas transmission and storage is primarily based on rates, customer commitment levels, timing, performance, commercial terms, reliability, service levels, location, reputation and fuel efficiencies. The Company's principal competitors in its transmission and storage market include companies that own major natural gas pipelines in the Marcellus and Utica Shales. In addition, the Company competes with companies that are building high-pressure gathering facilities that are able to transport natural gas to interstate pipelines without being subject to FERC jurisdiction. Major natural gas transmission companies that compete with the Company also have storage facilities connected to their transmission systems that compete with certain of the Company's storage facilities.
Key competition for water services include natural gas producers that develop their own water distribution systems in lieu of employing the Company's water services assets and other natural gas midstream companies that offer water services. The Company's ability to attract customers to its water service business depends on its ability to evaluate and select suitable projects and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment.
Further, natural gas as a fuel competes with other forms of energy available to end-users, including coal, liquid fuels and, increasingly, renewable and alternative energy. Demand for renewable and alternative energy is increasing generally with changes in consumer preferences and as renewable and alternative energy becomes more cost competitive with traditional fuels and more widely available. Continued increases in the demand for renewable and alternative energy at the expense of natural gas (or increases in the demand for other sources of energy, particularly if prices for natural gas significantly increase relative to other forms of energy as fuel) could lead to a reduction in demand for natural gas gathering, transmission and storage, and water services.
Regulatory Environment
FERC Regulation. The Company's interstate natural gas transmission and storage operations are regulated by the FERC under the Natural Gas Act (NGA), the Natural Gas Policy Act (NGPA) and the regulations, rules and policies promulgated under those and other statutes. Certain portions of the Company's gathering operations are also currently rate-regulated by the FERC in connection with its interstate transmission operations. The Company's FERC-regulated operations are pursuant to tariffs approved by the FERC that establish rates (other than market-based rate authority), cost recovery mechanisms and terms and conditions of service to its customers. Generally, the FERC's authority extends to:
•rates and charges for the Company's natural gas transmission and storage services and FERC-regulated gathering services;
•certification and construction of new interstate transmission and storage facilities;
•abandonment of interstate transmission and storage services and facilities and certificated gathering facilities;
•maintenance of accounts and records;
•relationships between pipelines and certain affiliates;
•terms and conditions of services and service contracts with customers;
•depreciation and amortization policies;
•acquisitions and dispositions of interstate transmission and storage facilities; and
•initiation and discontinuation of interstate transmission and storage services.
The FERC regulates the rates and charges for transmission and storage in interstate commerce. Unless market-based rates have been approved by the FERC, the maximum applicable recourse rates and terms and conditions for service are set forth in the pipeline's FERC-approved tariff. Generally, the maximum filed recourse rates for interstate pipelines are based on the cost of providing service, including the recovery of a return on the pipeline's actual and prudent historical investment costs. Key determinants in the ratemaking process include the depreciated capital costs of the facilities, the costs of providing service, the allowed rate of return and income tax allowance, as well as volume throughput and contractual capacity commitment assumptions.
Interstate pipelines may not charge rates or impose terms and conditions of service that, upon review by the FERC, are found to be unjust or unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential. Rate design and the allocation of costs also can affect a pipeline's profitability. While the ratemaking process establishes the maximum rate that can be charged, interstate pipelines such as the Company's transmission and storage system are permitted to discount their firm and interruptible rates without further FERC authorization down to a specified minimum level, provided they do not unduly discriminate. In addition, pipelines are allowed to negotiate different rates with their customers, under certain circumstances. Changes to rates or terms and conditions of service, and contracts can be proposed by a pipeline company under Section 4 of the NGA, or the existing interstate transmission and storage rates or terms and conditions of service, and contracts may be challenged by a complaint filed by interested persons including customers, state agencies or the FERC under Section 5 of the NGA. Rate increases proposed by a pipeline may be allowed to become effective subject to refund and/or a period of suspension, while rates or terms and conditions of service that are the subject of a complaint under Section 5 of the NGA are subject to prospective change by the FERC. Rate increases proposed by a regulated interstate pipeline may be challenged and such increases may ultimately be rejected by the FERC. 
The Company's interstate pipeline may also use negotiated rates that could involve rates above or below the recourse rate or rates that are subject to a different rate structure than the rates specified in the Company's interstate pipeline tariffs, provided that the affected customers are willing to agree to such rates and that the FERC has approved the negotiated rate agreement. A prerequisite for allowing the negotiated rates is that negotiated rate customers must have had the option to take service under the pipeline's recourse rates. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 97% of the system's contracted firm transmission capacity was subscribed by customers under negotiated rate agreements under its tariff. Some negotiated rate transactions are designed to fix the negotiated rate for the term of the firm transportation agreement and the fixed rate is generally not subject to adjustment for increased or decreased costs occurring during the contract term.
The FERC’s regulations also extend to the terms and conditions set forth in agreements for transmission and storage services executed between interstate pipelines and their customers. These service agreements are required to conform, in all material respects, with the form of service agreements set forth in the pipeline's FERC-approved tariff. Non-conforming agreements must be filed with and accepted by the FERC. In the event that the FERC finds that an agreement is materially non-conforming, in whole or in part, it could reject, or require the Company to seek modification of, the agreement, or alternatively require the Company to modify its tariff so that the non-conforming provisions are generally available to all customers or class of customers.
The FERC’s jurisdiction also extends to the certification and construction of new interstate transmission and storage facilities, including, but not limited to, acquisitions, facility replacements and upgrades, expansions, and abandonment of facilities and services. While the FERC currently exercises jurisdiction over the rates and terms of service for the Company’s FERC-regulated gathering services, these gathering facilities may not be subject to the FERC’s certification and construction authority. Prior to commencing construction of new or existing interstate transmission and storage facilities, an interstate pipeline must obtain (except in certain circumstances, such as where the activity is permitted under the FERC’s regulations or is authorized under the operator’s existing blanket certificate issued by the FERC) a certificate authorizing the construction, or file to amend its existing certificate, from the FERC. 
On April 19, 2018, the FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry (Certificate Policy Statement NOI) seeking information regarding whether, and if so how, it should revise its approach under its currently effective policy statement on the certification of new natural gas transportation facilities (Certificate Policy Statement). The formal comment period in this proceeding closed on June 25, 2018 and there has been no further action. The Company cannot currently predict when the FERC will issue an order in the Certificate Policy Statement NOI proceeding, or what action the FERC may take in any such order. 
The change of party control in Congress in 2021 raises the possibility of legislation revising the NGA or other statutes that may impact the Company’s existing facilities and operations or the ability to construct new facilities. Potential areas of revision include, but are not limited to, (i) amending Section 5 of the NGA to allow the FERC to require a pipeline to make refunds from the date that a NGA Section 5 complaint was filed with the FERC if rates are later found to be unjust and unreasonable; (ii) amending Section 7 of the NGA to require that condemnation authority not be exercised and construction may not begin until a FERC certificate order has been reviewed on rehearing; and (iii) amending Section 19(b) of the NGA to provide the FERC additional time to act on requests for rehearing. 
The change of party control at the FERC in 2021 may also lead to regulation or policy changes (in response to court orders or the aforementioned potential statutory changes or for other reasons) including, but not limited to, (i) requiring additional review of greenhouse gas emissions attributable to a proposed pipeline project; (ii) requiring applications for new pipeline construction to contain more stringent climate change analysis; and (iii) revising the Certificate Policy Statement to require additional showing of the need for a project beyond the traditional precedent agreement analysis.
FERC Regulation of Gathering Rates and Terms of Service. Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the FERC under the NGA. While the FERC does not generally regulate the rates and terms of service over facilities determined to be performing a natural gas gathering function, it has traditionally regulated rates charged by interstate pipelines for gathering services performed on the pipeline's own gathering facilities when those gathering services are performed in connection with jurisdictional interstate transmission services. The Company currently maintains rates and terms of service in its tariff for unbundled gathering services performed on its gathering facilities in connection with the transmission service. Just as with rates and terms of service for transmission and storage services, the Company's rates and terms of service for its FERC-regulated low-pressure gathering system may be challenged by complaint and are subject to prospective change by the FERC. The Company has submitted an application to the FERC requesting authorization to abandon these low-pressure gathering facilities and services. As of December 31, 2020, the application remained pending before the FERC.
The Company believes that its high-pressure gathering systems meet the traditional tests the FERC has used to establish a pipeline's status as an exempt gatherer not subject to regulation as a jurisdictional natural gas company. However, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is often the subject of 
litigation in the industry, so the classification and regulation of these systems are subject to change based on future determinations by the FERC, the courts or the U.S. Congress.
Pipeline Safety and Maintenance. The Company's interstate natural gas pipeline system is subject to regulation by PHMSA. PHMSA has established safety requirements pertaining to the design, installation, testing, construction, operation and maintenance of gas pipeline facilities, including requirements that pipeline operators develop a written qualification program for individuals performing covered tasks on pipeline facilities and implement pipeline integrity management programs. These integrity management plans require more frequent inspections and other preventive measures to ensure safe operation of oil and natural gas transportation pipelines in high population areas or facilities that are hard to evacuate and areas of daily concentrations of people.
Notwithstanding the investigatory and preventative maintenance costs incurred in the Company's performance of customary pipeline management activities, the Company may incur significant additional expenses if anomalous pipeline conditions are discovered or more stringent pipeline safety requirements are implemented. For example, in April 2016, PHMSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking addressing several integrity management topics and proposing new requirements to address safety issues for natural gas transmission and gathering lines (the Mega Rule). The proposed Mega Rule would strengthen existing integrity management requirements, expand assessment and repair requirements to pipelines in areas with medium population densities and extend regulatory requirements to onshore gas gathering lines that are currently exempt. Part one of the Mega Rule was finalized on July 1, 2020. Two remaining parts of the Mega Rule are awaiting finalization. Dates for finalization have not been updated or released by PHMSA due to COVID-19.
Further, in June 2016, then-President Obama signed the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 (the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act), extending PHMSA's statutory mandate under prior legislation through 2019. Although a reauthorization bill extending PHMSA’s statutory mandate until 2023 was introduced in 2019, Congress did not pass the bill in 2019 or 2020 and PHMSA is operating under a continuing resolution until a new bill is passed. In addition, the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act empowered PHMSA to address imminent hazards by imposing emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures on owners and operators of gas or hazardous liquid pipeline facilities without prior notice or an opportunity for a hearing and also required PHMSA to develop new safety standards for natural gas storage facilities by June 2018. Pursuant to those provisions of the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act, PHMSA issued two separate Interim Final Rules in October 2016 and December 2016 that expanded the agency's authority to impose emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures and strengthened the rules related to underground natural gas storage facilities, including well integrity, wellbore tubing and casing integrity. The December 2016 Interim Final Rule, relating to underground gas storage facilities, went into effect in January 2017. PHMSA determined, however, that it would not issue enforcement citations to any operators for violations of provisions of the December 2016 Interim Final Rule that had previously been non-mandatory provisions of American Petroleum Institute Recommended Practices 1170 and 1171 until one year after PHMSA issued a final rule. The final rule related to underground gas storage facilities became effective as of March 13, 2020.
Following the October 2016 Interim Final Rule, PHMSA also published two final rules on pipeline safety applicable to the Company: "Enhanced Emergency Order Procedures;" and "Safety of Gas Transmission Pipelines: Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure Reconfirmation, Expansion of Assessment Requirements." The Enhanced Emergency Order Procedures rule, which became effective on December 2, 2019, implements an existing statutory authorization for PHMSA to issue emergency orders related to pipeline safety if an unsafe condition or practice, or a combination of unsafe conditions and practices, constitutes, or is causing an imminent hazard. The Safety of Gas Transmissions Pipelines rule, which went into effect on July 1, 2020, requires operators of certain gas transmission pipelines that have been tested or that have inadequate records to determine the material strength of their lines by reconfirming the Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure, and establishes a new Moderate Consequence Area for determining regulatory requirements for gas transmission pipeline segments outside of high consequence areas. The rule also establishes new requirements for conducting baseline assessments, incorporates into the regulations industry standards and guidelines regarding design, construction and in-line inspections, and new requirements for data integration and risk analysis in integrity management programs, including seismicity, manufacturing and construction defects, and crack and crack-like defects, and includes several requirements that allow operators to notify PHMSA of proposed alternative approaches to achieving the objectives of the minimum safety standards. In 2020, the Company did not incur material compliance costs in connection with complying with the PHMSA rules applicable to the Company, and it is in the process of assessing the impact of these rules on its future costs of operations and revenue from operations.
States are generally preempted by federal law in the area of pipeline safety, but state agencies may qualify to assume responsibility for enforcing federal regulations over intrastate pipelines. They may also promulgate additive pipeline safety regulations provided that the state standards are at least as stringent as the federal standards. Although many of the Company's natural gas facilities fall within a class that is not subject to integrity management requirements, the Company may incur significant costs and liabilities associated with repair, remediation, preventive or mitigation measures associated with its non-exempt transmission pipelines. The costs, if any, for repair, remediation, preventive or mitigating actions that may be 
determined to be necessary as a result of the testing program, as well as lost cash flows resulting from shutting down the Company's pipelines during the pendency of any such actions, could be material to capital expenditures, earnings and the Company's competitive position.
Should the Company fail to comply with DOT regulations adopted under authority granted to PHMSA, it could be subject to penalties and fines. PHMSA has the statutory authority to impose civil penalties for pipeline safety violations up to a maximum of approximately $220,000 per day for each violation and approximately $2.2 million for a related series of violations. This maximum penalty authority established by statute will continue to be adjusted periodically to account for inflation. In addition, the Company could be required to make additional maintenance capital expenditures in the future for the above described or similar regulatory compliance initiatives that are not reflected in its forecasted maintenance capital expenditures. The Company believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with all existing federal, state and local pipeline safety laws and regulations. However, the adoption of new laws and regulations, such as those proposed by PHMSA, could result in significant added costs or delays in service or the termination of projects, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company in the future.
On December 27, 2020, then-President Trump signed the “Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety (PIPES Act) of 2020.” The PIPES Act identifies areas where Congress believed additional oversight, research, or regulations was needed. The PIPES Act includes new mandates for PHMSA to require operators to update, as needed, their emergency response plans and operating and maintenance plans. The PIPES Act also requires operators to manage records and update, as necessary, their existing district regulator stations to eliminate a common mode of failure. PHMSA will also require that leak detection and repair programs consider the environment, the use of advance lead detection practices and technologies, and for operators to be able to locate and categorize all leaks that are hazardous to human safety, the environment, or can become hazardous. The Company does not anticipate incurring material capital expenditures in connection with complying with the PIPES Act.
Environmental Matters
General. The Company's operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, which may have the following effects on the Company:
•requiring that the Company obtains various permits to conduct regulated activities;
•requiring the installation of pollution-control equipment or otherwise regulating the way the Company can handle or dispose of its wastes;
•limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas, such as wetlands, water sources, or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species; and
•requiring investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate or eliminate pollution conditions caused by the Company's operations or attributable to former operations.
In addition, the Company's operations and construction activities may be subject to county and local ordinances that restrict the time, place or manner in which those operations and activities may be conducted.
Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations or imposing additional compliance requirements. Also, certain environmental statutes impose strict, and in some cases joint and several, liability for the cleanup and restoration of sites where hydrocarbons or wastes have been disposed or otherwise released regardless of the fault of the current site owner or operator. Consequently, the Company may be subject to environmental liability at its currently owned or operated facilities for conditions caused by others prior to its involvement.
The Company has implemented programs and policies designed to keep its pipelines and other facilities in compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations, and the Company does not believe that its compliance with such legal requirements will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to pay dividends to its shareholders. Nonetheless, the trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment (and such trend will likely increase under the Biden Administration). Thus, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be significantly in excess of the amounts the Company currently anticipates. For example, in October 2015, the EPA revised the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone from 75 parts per billion for the current eight-hour primary and secondary ozone standards to 70 parts per billion for both standards. The EPA may designate 
the areas in which the Company operates as nonattainment areas. States that contain any areas designated as nonattainment areas will be required to develop implementation plans demonstrating how the areas will attain the applicable standard within a prescribed period of time. These plans may require the installation of additional equipment to control emissions. In addition, in May 2016, the EPA finalized rules that impose volatile organic compound and methane emissions limits (and collaterally reduce methane emissions) on certain types of compressors and pneumatic pumps, as well as requiring the development and implementation of leak monitoring plans for compressor stations. The EPA finalized amendments to some requirements in these standards in March 2018, September 2018 and September 2020, including rescission of certain requirements and revisions to other requirements such as fugitive emissions monitoring frequency. In September 2020, the EPA issued a correction to the regulations, removing transmission and storage segments from the source category subject to the rule and removing the methane emissions limits from the rule. President Biden has ordered the EPA to review these rules. Compliance with these or other new regulations could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of the Company's equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase the Company's capital expenditures and operating costs, which could adversely affect the Company's business. The Company tries to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance. While the Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations, there is no assurance that the current conditions will continue in the future.
Finally, pursuant to the Executive Order on Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis, on January 20, 2021, President Biden directed the heads of all federal agencies to review “all existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies, and any other similar agency actions (agency actions) promulgated, issued, or adopted” during the Trump administration for consistency with the policies established in the new Biden Administration order. Regulatory actions resulting from this review could adversely affect the Company’s business, including by requiring additional capital expenditures and increasing operating costs.
The following is a discussion of several of the material environmental laws and regulations, as amended from time to time, that relate to the Company's business.
Hazardous Substances and Waste. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a "hazardous substance" into the environment. These persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where a release of hazardous substances occurred and companies that transported, disposed or arranged for the transportation or disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these "responsible persons" may be subject to strict and joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. The Company generates materials in the course of its ordinary operations that are regulated as "hazardous substances" under CERCLA or similar state laws and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA, or such laws, for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment.
In the ordinary course of the Company's operations, the Company generates wastes constituting solid wastes, and in some instances hazardous wastes, which are subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and comparable state statutes. While the RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. While certain petroleum production wastes are excluded from RCRA's hazardous waste regulations, it is possible that these wastes will in the future be designated as "hazardous wastes" and be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses.
The Company owns, leases or operates properties where petroleum hydrocarbons are being or have been handled for many years. The Company has generally utilized operating and disposal practices that are standard in the industry at the time, although petroleum hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned, leased or operated by the Company, or on or under the other locations where these petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes have been transported for treatment or disposal. Petroleum hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed or released on certain of these properties by third parties that previously operated, owned or leased these properties and whose treatment and disposal or release of petroleum hydrocarbons and other wastes were not under the Company's control. These properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, the Company could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or 
operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater) or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination.
Air Emissions. The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including the Company's compressor stations, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require that the Company obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities, obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations and utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions. The Company's failure to comply with these requirements could subject it to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations and, potentially, criminal enforcement actions. The Company may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining permits and approvals for air emissions. These types of capital expenditures could also be required in areas that are nonattainment for the ozone national ambient air quality standards depending on the design of the relevant state’s implementation plan to meet the air quality standards. Compliance with these requirements may require modifications to certain of the Company's operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions from the Company's compressors that could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely affect the Company's business.
Climate Change. Legislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are in various phases of discussion or implementation and will be a major focus of the Biden Administration. On January 27, 2021, President Biden signed an Executive Order on “Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad.” This Executive Order contains sweeping direction to the executive branch to address climate issues. Among other things, the order put a “pause” on any new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a review by the Department of the Interior. The Interior Department is also to consider whether to adjust oil and gas royalties associated with fossil fuels extracted from public lands and offshore waters.
The EPA regulates GHG emissions from new and modified facilities that are potential major sources of criteria pollutants under the Clean Air Act's Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V programs and has adopted regulations that require, among other things, preconstruction and operating permits for certain large stationary sources and the monitoring and reporting of GHGs from certain onshore oil and natural gas production sources on an annual basis.
The EPA has also regulated methane and volatile organic compound emissions from the oil and gas sector through its new source performance standard program. In September 2020, the EPA issued a final rule that removed the transmission and storage segments from the source category subject to the methane and volatile organic compound emissions limitations. That regulation also removed the methane emissions limitations. In an Executive Order issued on January 20, 2021, President Biden directed the EPA to review this rule and consider suspending, revising, or rescinding it.
In addition, in 2015, the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement, which was signed by the U.S. in April 2016, requires countries to review and "represent a progression" in their intended nationally determined contributions (which set GHG emission reduction goals) every five years beginning in 2020. The United States withdrew from the Paris Agreement in 2020; however, President Biden signed an executive order on January 20, 2021, for the United States to rejoin the Paris Agreement. Depending on the United States’ nationally determined contribution and how it is achieved, the Company could be required to reduce its GHG emissions, which would increase the Company’s cost of environmental compliance.
The U.S. Congress, along with federal and state agencies, has considered measures to reduce the emissions of GHGs. Legislation or regulation that restricts carbon emissions could increase the Company's cost of environmental compliance by requiring the Company to install new equipment to reduce emissions from larger facilities and/or, depending on any future legislation, purchase emission allowances. The effect of climate change legislation or regulation on the Company's business is currently uncertain. If the Company incurs additional costs to comply with such legislation or regulations, it may not be able to pass on the higher costs to its customers or recover all the costs related to complying with such requirements and any such recovery may depend on events beyond the Company's control, including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the FERC or state regulatory agencies and the provisions of any final legislation or implementing regulations. The Company's future results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could be adversely affected if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates or otherwise passed on to its customers. Additionally, the Company's producer customers may also be affected by legislation or regulation, which may, directly or indirectly, adversely impact their ability and willingness to produce natural gas and accordingly affect such producers' financial health or reduce the volumes delivered to the Company and demand for its services. Climate change and GHG legislation or regulation could delay or otherwise negatively affect efforts to obtain and maintain permits and other regulatory approvals for existing and new facilities, impose additional monitoring and reporting requirements or adversely affect demand for the natural gas the Company gathers, transports and stores. The effect on the 
Company of any new legislative or regulatory measures on the Company will depend on the particular provisions that are ultimately adopted.
Water Discharges. The federal Clean Water Act and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants or dredged and fill material into state waters as well as waters of the United States, including adjacent wetlands. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of permits issued by the EPA, the Army Corps or an analogous state agency. In September 2015, new EPA and Army Corps rules defining the scope of the EPA's and the Army Corps' jurisdiction became effective (the 2015 Clean Water Rule). But the 2015 Clean Water Rule was promptly challenged in courts and was enjoined by judicial action in some states. Further, in October 2019 the EPA issued a rule repealing the 2015 Clean Water Rule and recodifying the preexisting regulations. In June 2020, new EPA and Army Corps regulations narrowing the regulatory scope of the Clean Water Act became effective (the 2020 Navigable Waters Protection Rule). Like the 2015 Clean Water Rule, the 2020 Navigable Water Protection Rule was promptly challenged in courts and has been enjoined by judicial action in at least one state. To the extent that any future rules expand the scope of the Clean Water Act's jurisdiction, the Company could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for activities in jurisdictional waters, including wetlands.
Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of regulated waters in the event of a hydrocarbon spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws. The Company believes that compliance with existing permits and foreseeable new permit requirements will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to pay dividends to its shareholders.
National Environmental Policy Act. The construction of interstate natural gas transportation pipelines pursuant to the NGA requires authorization from the FERC. The FERC actions are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). NEPA requires federal agencies, such as the FERC, to evaluate major federal actions having the potential to significantly affect the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will either prepare an environmental assessment that examines the potential direct, indirect and cumulative effects of a proposed project or, if necessary, a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement. Any proposed plans for future construction activities that require FERC authorization will be subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the potential to significantly delay or limit, and significantly increase the cost of, development of midstream infrastructure. In September 2020, new Council on Environmental Quality regulations intended to streamline the NEPA evaluation process went into effect. These rules have been challenged in courts, although initial efforts to enjoin enforcement of the rule were unsuccessful.
Endangered Species Act. The federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) restricts activities that may adversely affect endangered and threatened species or their habitats. Federal agencies are required to ensure that any action authorized, funded or carried out by them is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or modify their critical habitat. While some of the Company's facilities are located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species, the Company is confident that it is in substantial compliance with the ESA. The designation of previously unprotected species as being endangered or threatened, or the designation of previously unprotected areas as a critical habitat for such species, could cause the Company to incur additional costs, result in delays in construction of pipelines and facilities, or cause the Company to become subject to operating restrictions in areas where the species are known to exist. For example, the FWS continues to receive hundreds of petitions to consider listing additional species as endangered or threatened and is being regularly sued or threatened with lawsuits to address these petitions. Some of these legal actions may result in the listing of species located in areas in which the Company operates. Throughout 2020, the United States Department of Interior narrowed the ESA regulations and their applicability. These regulations have been challenged in the courts.
Employee Health and Safety. The Company is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community "right-to-know" regulations and comparable state laws and regulations require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in the Company's operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. The Company is confident that it is in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety.
Seasonality
Weather affects natural gas demand for power generation and heating purposes. Peak demand for natural gas typically occurs during the winter months as a result of the heating load.
Human Capital Management
To ensure that we are well positioned to provide innovative solutions and reliable energy infrastructure services in a safe, efficient and responsible manner, the Company seeks to employ a team of highly dedicated and accomplished people who genuinely care about the success of the Company. Creating an engaging workplace environment that provides for competitive pay and benefits, attractive career development opportunities, and a collaborative, respectful culture further enables the Company to achieve continued success. 
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 771 employees; during 2020, the Company's overall turnover was just above 6% (with less than 4% being voluntary turnover) of the total employee population. While most of the Company's employees work a full-time schedule, the Company does offer several flexible work opportunities including the option for part-time and remote work, as applicable based on job duties, as well as alternative work schedules. 
Company Culture. The Company’s culture is shaped by its five core values of Safety, Integrity, Collaboration, Transparency, and Excellence. These values are the essence of the Company's identity and provide the framework for the conduct of its employees, as well as the relationships the Company has with its stakeholders, including its customers, communities, vendors, and shareholders. 
In July 2019, the Company formed a Culture Champions Group, which consists of a diverse representation of employees across the organization below the director level, with the objective of soliciting suggestions from employees on ways to enhance the Company's culture. In early 2020, the Company also conducted an anonymous culture survey to seek feedback from employees on a variety of topics, including understanding of the Company's strategy, vision, departmental coordination, employee development, and empowerment. Based on the results of the survey, as well as feedback provided to the Culture Champions Group, the Company has implemented a number of actions within the organization to improve and enhance employee recognition, leadership visibility and communication, and integration and collaboration between departments, including but not limited to coffee talks (informational sessions on various topics), peer networking initiatives, lunches with leaders, and employee communication sessions. 
Diversity and Inclusion. The Company believes each employee is essential to its continued success and the Company seeks to provide every employee with the foundation and environment needed to achieve the employee’s goals. This objective begins with the Company's commitment to diversity and inclusion. In July 2020, the Company formally launched its Inclusion program, which focuses on the Company's core value of Collaboration through cultivating an inclusive, respectful work environment that values differing perspectives and encourages the power of teamwork and accountability. The Company's program is composed of four pillars – Accountability, External Recruitment Outreach, Internal Outreach, and External Partnerships. Through each of these pillars, the Company seeks to touch every aspect of its business. During 2020, under this program, the Company launched a micro-learning platform providing employees with inclusion-related content on a bi-weekly basis; conducted manager inclusion training; completed a review of human resources policies in support of an inclusive work environment; created an Inclusion scorecard to capture relevant employee demographics for discussion with leadership; and began the steps to establish the Company's first gender neutral restroom in its headquarters location. 
The Company also partners with several diverse organizations from a networking and recruitment perspective. Through these partnerships, the Company aims to broaden and extend its recruitment outreach efforts with an emphasis on finding and hiring diverse individuals, including veterans and ethnically diverse individuals, and persons who identify as having a disability. The Company's supply chain organization also recognizes the value of supplier diversity and acknowledges and tracks its spend with diverse contract suppliers. 
Total Rewards. The Company believes its employees are critical to the success of its business, and the Company structures its total rewards and benefits offerings to attract and retain a talented and engaged workforce. These benefits include, but are not limited to, the following:
•Comprehensive health insurance, including access to health savings accounts, to all full-time employees and part-time employees working at least 20 hours per week;
•A Take Charge Wellness program, through which the Company offers wellness information, education and special programs, including in certain instances health coaches, to employees and their family members on topics such as nutrition, fitness, safety and disease prevention;
•Annual flu immunizations;
•Access to an Employee Assistance Program;
•Tuition reimbursement through an Education Assistance Program;
•Adoption assistance;
•Paid time off for holidays, vacation, bereavement, jury duty, military and volunteer time;

•A retirement plan in which the Company matches 50% of every dollar the employee contributes up to a maximum of 3% of base compensation, including overtime, pay in lieu of vacation and annual incentive awards and a retirement contribution equal to 6% of the employee’s salary and annual incentive award.
Safety. Above all else, safety is the Company's main priority – this includes the safety of its employees, contractors, and communities – always. The Company is committed to maintaining a strong safety culture and to emphasizing the importance of its employees’ role in identifying, mitigating and communicating safety risks. The Company's Board of Directors (Board) provides oversight for the Company's safety initiatives through the Health, Safety, Security and Environmental (HSSE) Committee of the Board. The Company tracks numerous safety-related metrics to evaluate its safety performance and has incorporated safety metrics into the Company's annual incentive plan. By linking these metrics to employees’ compensation, the Company believes it can more effectively and proactively address safety issues, increase the safety of the Company's worksites and offices, and achieve employee buy-in. Additionally, the Company's President and Chief Operating Officer distributes monthly comprehensive safety memorandums to all employees and members of the Board keeping them abreast of the Company’s safety performance. In 2020, the Company experienced the following safety highlights: 
•612% increase in safety observations over 2019;
•197 proactive corrected safety hazards;
•36% decrease in employee OSHA Days Away Restricted or Transferred (DART) rate over 2019;
•11% decrease in employee OSHA Total Recordable Incident Rate over 2019; and
•10% decrease in employee incident with serious potential rate over 2019.
In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has proactively undertaken a number of company-wide measures intended to promote the safety of field and office-based employees and contractors (including, among other things, establishing an Infectious Disease Response Team, instituting enhanced self-protection and office sanitation measures, eliminating non-essential business travel, implementing a mandatory work-from-home protocol for a substantial majority of the Company’s employees through at least June 1, 2021, instituting face covering protocols, providing certain medical benefit enhancements, practicing social distancing in field operations where possible, sharing the Company’s infectious disease response plan with suppliers and contractors, and timely communicating updates to employees and other relevant parties). In addition, the Company has implemented additional mitigation efforts in connection with the remobilization of certain field employees and contractors. The Company’s Infectious Disease Response Team continues to monitor and assist in implementing mitigation efforts in respect of potential areas of risk for the Company and its stakeholders. 
Talent Development. The Company believes it has a robust talent and leadership development framework. The Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board oversees the development program for the Company's executive officers and other key members of management. The Company provides leadership training to multiple levels of Company leaders and managers. The Company also offers customized, executive-level assessment and development programs for its senior leaders. In addition to the structured leadership programs offered, several of the Company's employees have participated in individual coaching sessions with professional coaches. 
In addition, the Company offers other learning opportunities for employees across the organization to enhance their skill sets. The Company has a partnership with an external organization that offers a broad range of training centered on professional skills, desktop applications, and technical knowledge. Additionally, all of the Company's employees participate in required compliance training and a certain population of the Company's employees participate in operational and important safety trainings geared towards their individual roles within the organization. For 2020, the Company's employees completed an aggregate of more than 8,330 hours of training covering the aforementioned topics.
