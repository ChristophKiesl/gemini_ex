ITEM 1. BUSINESS
GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS
H&R Block, Inc. was organized as a corporation in 1955 under the laws of the State of Missouri and has subsidiaries that provide tax preparation and other services. A complete list of our subsidiaries as of April 30, 2017 can be found in Exhibit 21.
We provide assisted income tax return preparation, digital do-it-yourself (DIY) tax solutions and other services and products related to income tax return preparation to the general public primarily in the United States (U.S.), Canada, Australia, and their respective territories. 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS – 
Refund Advance Loans. We began offering interest-free Refund Advance loans (RAs) during the 2017 tax season. RAs were available to eligible assisted U.S. tax preparation clients of the Company and participating franchise locations. On October 25, 2016, subsidiaries of the Company entered into a Refund Advance Program Agreement with MetaBank, a federal savings bank (MetaBank), and Specialty Consumer Services, L.P., a Texas limited partnership (SCS), pursuant to which MetaBank originated RAs and SCS provided technology, software, and underwriting support services. 

H&R Block, Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 1

MetaBank and BofI Federal Bank (BofI) provided funding for the loans, with BofI also performing certain disbursement and repayment services. 
RAs were offered in amounts of $500, $750 or $1,250, based on client eligibility as determined by the loan originator. We paid loan origination fees of $28.6 million to MetaBank based on volume and customer type which is approximately $32 to $36 on average for each funded loan. The loan origination fees were intended to cover expected loan losses and payments to capital providers, among other items. In addition, Block Financial LLC (Block Financial) provided MetaBank and BofI with limited guaranties up to $73 million in the aggregate, subject to specified thresholds, which would cover certain incremental loan losses. At April 30, 2017, we had accrued an estimated liability of $0.7 million related to the RA program.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS
We operate as a single segment that includes all of our continuing operations, which are designed to enable clients to obtain tax preparation services seamlessly. See discussion below and in Item 8, note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
GENERAL – We provide assisted and DIY tax return preparation solutions through multiple channels (including in-person, online and mobile applications, and desktop software) and distribute H&R Block-branded financial products and services, including those of our financial partners, to the general public primarily in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and their respective territories. Major revenue sources include fees earned for tax preparation and related services performed at company-owned retail tax offices, royalties from franchisees, sales of desktop tax preparation software, fees for online tax preparation services and fees from complementary services and products. By offering assisted and DIY tax solutions through multiple channels, we seek to serve our clients in the manner they choose to be served. 
Tax Returns Prepared. During fiscal year 2017, 23.0 million tax returns were prepared by and through H&R Block worldwide, a decline of 0.6% from 23.1 million in fiscal year 2016 and 24.1 million in fiscal year 2015. In the U.S., 19.5 million tax returns were prepared by and through H&R Block during fiscal year 2017, compared to 19.7 million in 2016 and 20.6 million in 2015. 
U.S. tax returns prepared by and through us during the 2017 tax season, including those prepared by our franchisees and through our DIY solutions, constituted approximately 14% of an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) estimate of total individual income tax returns filed during the 2017 tax season, compared to approximately 14% in the prior year. See Item 7, under "Results of Operations," for further discussion of changes in the number of tax returns prepared.
ASSISTED – Assisted income tax return preparation and related services are provided by tax professionals via a system of retail offices operated directly by us or our franchisees or virtually via the internet.
Offices. During the 2017 tax season, we, together with our franchisees, operated in 10,036 offices across the U.S. at the peak of the tax season, compared to 10,213 in the prior year. A summary of our company-owned and franchise offices is included in Item 7, under "Operating Statistics." 
Franchises. We offer franchises as a way to expand our presence in certain geographic areas. Our franchise arrangements provide us with certain rights designed to protect our brand. Most of our franchisees receive, among other things, the right to use our trademarks and software, access to product offerings and expertise, signs, specialized forms, advertising, and initial and ongoing training and advisory services. Our franchisees pay us approximately 30% of gross tax return preparation and related service revenues as a franchise royalty in the U.S. Our franchise arrangements typically include a ten-year term and do not provide for automatic renewal. 
From time to time, we have sold certain company-owned offices to existing franchisees or have acquired the assets of existing franchisees and other tax return preparation businesses, and may continue to do so if future conditions warrant and satisfactory terms can be negotiated. 
DO-IT-YOURSELF – We develop and market DIY income tax preparation software. We offer a comprehensive range of DIY tax services, including preparation of federal and state income tax returns, review of tax returns by a tax professional, access to tax tips, advice and tax-related news, use of calculators for tax planning, error checking and electronic filing. Our online software may be accessed through our website at www.hrblock.com, while our desktop software may be purchased online, through third-party retail stores or via direct mail.

2 | 2017 Form 10-K | H&R Block, Inc.

We are a member of Free File, Inc. (FF), formerly known as the Free File Alliance. This organization was created by the tax return preparation industry and the IRS, and allows qualified filers with an adjusted gross income of $64,000 or less to prepare and file their federal return online at no charge. We believe this program provides a valuable public service and increases our visibility with new clients. 
We develop and offer applications for mobile devices which provide tax return preparation solutions and related services and products to clients, including tools that complement our other tax preparation services and products.
OTHER OFFERINGS – In addition to our tax services and products, we also offer U.S. clients a number of additional services, including refund transfers (RTs), H&R Block Emerald Advance® lines of credit (EAs), H&R Block Emerald Prepaid MasterCard®, our Peace of Mind® Extended Service Plan (POM), Tax Identity Shield® (TIS), RAs and, for our Canadian clients, an Instant Cash Back® refund option. 
Refund Transfers. RTs enable clients to receive their tax refunds by their chosen method of disbursement and include a feature enabling clients to deduct tax preparation and service fees from their tax refunds. Clients may choose to receive their RT proceeds by direct deposit to a deposit account, by a load to their H&R Block Emerald Prepaid MasterCard® or by receiving a check. RTs are available to U.S. clients and are frequently obtained by those who (1) do not have bank accounts into which the IRS can direct deposit their refunds; (2) like the convenience and benefits of a temporary account for receipt of their refund; or (3) prefer to have their tax preparation fees paid directly out of their refunds. RTs are offered through our relationship with BofI. We offer a similar program to our Canadian clients, referred to as H&R Block Pay With Refund®.
H&R Block Emerald Advance® Lines of Credit. EAs are lines of credit offered to clients in our offices, typically from late November through December, currently in an amount not to exceed $1,000. If the borrower meets certain criteria as agreed in the loan terms, the line of credit can be utilized year-round. In addition to the required monthly payments, borrowers may elect to pay down balances on EAs with their tax refunds. These lines of credit are offered by BofI, and we subsequently purchase a participation interest in the outstanding balances.
H&R Block Emerald Prepaid Mastercard®. The H&R Block Emerald Prepaid MasterCard® enables clients to receive their tax refunds from the IRS directly on a prepaid debit card, or to direct RT or EA proceeds to the card. The card can be used for everyday purchases, bill payments and ATM withdrawals anywhere MasterCard® (MasterCard is a registered trademark of MasterCard International Incorporated) is accepted. Additional funds can be added to the card year-round through direct deposit or at participating retail locations. We distribute the H&R Block Emerald Prepaid MasterCard® issued by BofI.
Peace of Mind® Extended Service Plan. In addition to our standard guarantee, we offer POM to U.S. and Canadian clients, whereby we (1) represent our clients if they are audited by the IRS or Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), and (2) assume the cost, subject to certain limits, of additional taxes owed by a client resulting from errors attributable to H&R Block. The additional taxes paid under POM have a cumulative limit of $6,000 for U.S. clients and $3,000CAD for Canadian clients with respect to the federal, state and local tax returns we prepared for applicable clients during the taxable year protected by POM.
Tax Identity Shield®. This service program offers clients assistance obtaining additional IRS identity protection, when eligible, to better protect against unauthorized third parties filing a fraudulent tax return with their information. TIS also includes a pre-tax season identity theft risk assessment, notification if their information is detected on a tax return filed through H&R Block and access to services to help restore their tax identity if necessary.
Refund Advance Loans. RAs are interest-free loans available to eligible assisted U.S. tax preparation clients in company-owned and participating franchise locations. In tax season 2017, RAs were offered in amounts of $500, $750 or $1,250, based on client eligibility as determined by MetaBank. 
Instant Cash Back®. Our Canadian operations advance refunds due to certain clients from the CRA, for a fee. The fee charged for this service is mandated by federal legislation which is administered by the CRA. The client assigns to us the full amount of the tax refund to be issued by the CRA and the refund amount is then sent by the CRA directly to us. 
SEASONALITY OF BUSINESS – Because most of our clients file their tax returns during the period from January through April of each year, a substantial majority of our revenues from income tax return preparation and related 

H&R Block, Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 3

services and products are earned during this period. As a result, we generally operate at a loss through a majority of the fiscal year.
COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS – We provide both assisted and DIY tax preparation services and products and face substantial competition in and across each category. There are a substantial number of tax return preparation firms and accounting firms offering tax return preparation services, and we face significant competition from independent tax preparers and certified public accountants. Many tax return preparation firms are involved in providing electronic filing services and RTs or similar services to the public. Tax return preparation firms are highly competitive with regard to price and service, and many firms offer services that may include preparation of tax returns at no charge. Our assisted tax preparation business also faces competition from firms offering DIY tax preparation services and products. 
Our DIY tax solutions include various forms of digital electronic assistance, including online and mobile applications and desktop software. Many other companies offer digital and online tax preparation services, including Intuit Inc., our largest competitor offering such services. Like all tax return preparation services and products, price and marketing competition for digital tax preparation services is intense among value and premium product offerings and many firms offer digital services and products at no charge. Our DIY tax solutions also compete with in-office tax preparation services. U.S. federal and certain state and foreign taxing authorities also currently offer, or facilitate the offering of, tax return preparation and filing options to taxpayers at no charge.
In terms of the number of offices and revenues, we believe we are the largest single provider of tax return preparation solutions and electronic filing services in the U.S. In terms of the number of tax returns prepared, we believe we are the second largest provider in the U.S. We also believe we operate the largest tax return preparation businesses in Canada and Australia.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION – TAX PREPARERS – Our tax preparation business is subject to various forms of government regulation, including the following:
U.S. Federal Tax Preparer Regulations. U.S. federal legislation requires income tax return preparers to, among other things, set forth their signatures and identification numbers, including their Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN), on all tax returns prepared by them and retain all tax returns prepared by them for three years. U.S. federal laws also subject income tax return preparers to accuracy-related penalties in connection with the preparation of income tax returns. Preparers may be prohibited from continuing to act as income tax return preparers if they repeatedly engage in specified misconduct.
The U.S. federal government regulates the electronic filing of income tax returns in part by requiring electronic filers to comply with all publications and notices of the IRS applicable to electronic filing. We are required to provide certain electronic filing information to taxpayers and comply with advertising standards for electronic filers. We are also subject to possible monitoring by the IRS, and if deemed appropriate, the IRS could impose various penalties, including penalties for improper disclosure or use of taxpayer information, other preparer penalties or suspension from the IRS electronic filing program.
Financial Consumer Protection and Privacy Regulations. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and related Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulations require income tax preparers to (1) adopt and disclose consumer privacy notices, (2) provide consumers a reasonable opportunity to control (via "opt-out") whether their nonpublic personal information is disclosed to unaffiliated third-parties (subject to certain exceptions), and (3) implement reasonable safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of nonpublic personal information. In addition, the IRS generally prohibits the use or disclosure of taxpayer information by tax return preparers for purposes other than tax return preparation without the prior written consent of the taxpayer. The CFPB may issue regulations that apply to our subsidiaries, or certain of our third party service providers that provide consumer financial services and products. The CFPB may examine, and take enforcement actions against, our subsidiaries or our third party service providers. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors," for further information on the CFPB and its recent actions.
State Regulations. Certain states have privacy laws and regulations in addition to the U.S. federal regulations described above. Most states also have data security breach notice laws which may require notice to impacted individuals and others if there is unauthorized access to certain sensitive personal information. Several states require income tax return preparers to, among other things, register as a return preparer and comply with certain registration requirements such as testing and continuing education requirements. State regulations may also subject income tax 

4 | 2017 Form 10-K | H&R Block, Inc.

return preparers to accuracy-related penalties in connection with the preparation of income tax returns, and may prohibit preparers from continuing to act as income tax return preparers if they engage in specified misconduct. Certain states have regulations and requirements relating to offering income tax courses. These requirements may include licensing, bonding and certain restrictions on advertising.
Franchise Regulations. Many of the income tax return preparation offices operating in the U.S. under the name "H&R Block" are operated by franchisees. Our franchising activities are subject to the rules and regulations of the FTC, potential enforcement by the CFPB, and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. The FTC and various state laws require us to furnish to prospective franchisees a franchise disclosure document containing certain prescribed information. A number of states in which we are currently franchising regulate the sale of franchises and require registration of the franchise disclosure document with certain state authorities. We are currently operating under exemptions from registration in several of these states based on our net worth and experience. Substantive state laws regulating the franchisor/franchisee relationship presently exist in a large number of states, and bills have been introduced in Congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of the franchisor/franchisee relationship in certain respects. The state laws often limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-competition provisions, the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise and the ability of a franchisor to designate sources of supply. From time to time, we may make appropriate amendments to our franchise disclosure document to comply with our disclosure obligations under U.S. federal and state laws.
FOREIGN REGULATIONS – We are also subject to a variety of other regulations in various foreign markets, including anti-corruption laws, and regulations concerning privacy, data protection and data retention. Foreign regulations and laws potentially affecting our business are evolving rapidly. We rely on external and internal counsel in the countries in which we do business to advise us regarding compliance with applicable laws and regulations. As our international operations grow, we continue to develop and enhance our internal legal and operational compliance programs that guide our businesses in complying with laws and regulations applicable in the countries in which we do business. 
SERVICE MARKS, TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS
We have made a practice of offering our services and products under service marks and trademarks and of securing registration for many of these marks in the U.S. and other countries where our services and products are marketed. We consider these service marks and trademarks, in the aggregate, to be of material importance to our business, particularly our businesses providing services and products under the "H&R Block" brand. The initial duration of U.S. federal trademark registrations is 10 years. Most U.S. federal registrations can be renewed perpetually at 10-year intervals and remain enforceable so long as the marks continue to be used. 
We hold a small but growing patent portfolio that we believe is important to our overall competitive position, although we are not materially dependent on any one patent or particular group of patents in our portfolio at this time. Our patents have remaining terms generally ranging from one to 20 years.
EMPLOYEES AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
We had approximately 2,300 regular full-time employees as of April 30, 2017. Our business is dependent on the availability of a seasonal workforce, including tax professionals, and our ability to hire, train, and supervise these employees. The highest number of persons we employed during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2017, including these seasonal employees, was approximately 87,500.
