Item 1.    Business
Introduction
Bausch Health Companies Inc. is a global company whose mission is to improve people’s lives with our health care products. We develop, manufacture and market, primarily in the therapeutic areas of eye-health, gastroenterology (“GI”) and dermatology, a broad range of: (i) branded pharmaceuticals, (ii) generic and branded generic pharmaceuticals, (iii) over-the-counter (“OTC”) products and (iv) medical devices (contact lenses, intraocular lenses, ophthalmic surgical equipment and aesthetics devices), which are marketed directly or indirectly in approximately 100 countries. 
Our portfolio of products falls into four operating and reportable segments: (i) Bausch + Lomb/International, (ii) Salix, (iii) Ortho Dermatologics and (iv) Diversified Products.
•The Bausch + Lomb/International segment consists of: (i) sales in the U.S. of pharmaceutical products, OTC products and medical device products, primarily comprised of Bausch + Lomb products, with a focus on the Vision Care, Surgical, Consumer and Ophthalmology Rx products and (ii) with the exception of sales of Solta products, sales in Canada, Europe, Asia, Australia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East of branded pharmaceutical products, branded generic pharmaceutical products, OTC products, medical device products and Bausch + Lomb products.
•The Salix segment consists of sales in the U.S. of GI products.
•The Ortho Dermatologics segment consists of: (i) sales in the U.S. of Ortho Dermatologics (dermatological) products and (ii) global sales of Solta medical aesthetic devices.
•The Diversified Products segment consists of sales in the U.S. of: (i) pharmaceutical products in the areas of neurology and certain other therapeutic classes, (ii) generic products and (iii) dentistry products.
For additional discussion of our reportable segments, see the discussion in Item 1. "Business — Segment Information" and Note 22, "SEGMENT INFORMATION" to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these reportable segments.
As discussed further in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview — Separation of Bausch + Lomb Eye-Health Business” of this Form 10-K, on August 6, 2020, the Company announced that it intends to separate its eye-health business into an independent publicly traded entity from the remainder of Bausch Health Companies Inc. (the “Separation”). The Separation will establish two separate companies that include: (i) a fully integrated eye-health company which will consist of the Company’s Bausch + Lomb Global Vision Care, Global Surgical, Global Consumer and Global Ophthalmology Rx businesses and (ii) a diversified pharmaceutical company which will include the Company’s Salix, International Rx, Solta, generic products, neurology, dentistry and medical dermatology pharmaceutical businesses. The anticipated separation is subject to regulatory approvals and certain conditions, including final approval by the Company’s Board of Directors and any shareholder vote requirements that may be applicable. In connection with the Separation, the Company expects to realign and begin managing its operations in a manner consistent with the organizational structure of the two separate entities as proposed by the Separation during the first quarter of 2021. Accordingly, the Company expects to begin reporting under the following reporting segments on a retrospective basis beginning with its first quarter of 2021: Bausch + Lomb, International Rx, Salix, Ortho Dermatologics and Diversified Products. 
We are in the process of addressing the organization, structure and pro forma capitalizations of the two entities post-separation. As a result, the information in this Form 10-K relating to the Separation is preliminary and may change as the transaction progresses and any such change may be material. Further, there can be no assurance that the Separation will occur. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — Risk Relating to the Separation” of this Form 10-K for additional risks relating to the Separation.
COVID-19 Pandemic 
In December 2019, a novel strain of the coronavirus disease, COVID-19, was identified in Wuhan, China. Since then, COVID-19 has spread to most of the world, including the United States, Canada and Europe, and was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (the "WHO") on March 11, 2020. As a global health care company, now more than ever, we remain focused on our mission of helping to improve people’s lives with our health care products. 
We are and will continue to closely monitor the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and related responses from governments and private sector participants on the Company, our customers, supply chain, third-party suppliers, project 

development timelines, costs, revenue, margins, liquidity and financial condition and our planned actions and responses to this pandemic. To date, the Company has been able to continue its operations with limited disruptions in supply and manufacturing.
We believe we have responded quickly to the human and commercial challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and that our early actions have, so far, enabled us to keep our employees safe and our supply lines largely intact and we believe these actions have laid the foundation for us to work our way through the uncertainties to come. Importantly, we believe that the steps we took over the last several years to manage our capital structure place us in a strong position to maintain sufficient liquidity to continue operations through an extended pandemic and we believe that our businesses will not see their long-term value diminished by this unprecedented situation. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview — Impacts of COVID-19” of this Form 10-K for additional information on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and Item 1A. “Risk Factors — Risk Relating to COVID-19” of this Form 10-K for additional risks relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Business Strategy 
Our strategy is to focus our business on core therapeutic classes that offer attractive growth opportunities. Within our chosen therapeutic classes, we prioritize durable products which we believe have the potential for strong operating margins and evidence of growth opportunities. We believe this strategy has reduced complexity in our operations and maximizes the value of our: (i) eye-health, (ii) GI and (iii) dermatology businesses, which collectively now represent a substantial portion of our revenues. We have found and continue to believe there is significant opportunity in these businesses and we believe our existing portfolio, commercial footprint and pipeline of product development projects position us to successfully compete in these markets and provide us with the greatest opportunity to build value for our shareholders. We identify these businesses as “core”, meaning that we believe we are best positioned to grow and develop them.
We believe we have a well-established product portfolio that is mixed within our core businesses and provides a sustainable revenue stream to fund our operations. Our continued success is dependent upon our ability to continually refresh our pipeline and bring new product solutions to the market that meet changing demands and replace other products that have lost momentum. We have a robust pipeline that we believe not only provides for the next generation of our existing products, but is also poised to bring new and innovative solutions to market. Our R&D organization focuses on the development of products through clinical trials and, as of December 31, 2020, included approximately 1,300 dedicated R&D and quality assurance employees in 23 R&D facilities. 
We have focused our R&D to advance development programs that we believe will drive growth in our core businesses, while creating efficiencies in our R&D efforts and expenses. Although we primarily rely on our R&D organization to build-out and refresh our product portfolio, to supplement those efforts, we continually seek out opportunities, such as co-promotions, licensing agreements and strategic acquisitions, to leverage our commercial footprint, particularly our sales force, by strategically aligning ourselves with other innovative product solutions that, when coupled with our existing product portfolio, address specific needs in the market. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview — Focus on Core Businesses” of this Form 10-K.

We have approximately 1,300 products in our portfolio of products, which fall into four operating and reportable segments: (i) Bausch + Lomb/International, (ii) Salix, (iii) Ortho Dermatologics and (iv) Diversified Products. Segment revenues for the years 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:

Comparative segment information for 2020, 2019 and 2018 is further presented in Note 22, "SEGMENT INFORMATION" to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements.

Bausch + Lomb/International
Our Bausch + Lomb/International segment includes our global Bausch + Lomb eye-health business and our International Rx business. Our global Bausch + Lomb eye-health business includes our Global Vision Care, Global Surgical, Global Consumer and Global Ophthalmology Rx products, which in aggregate accounted for approximately 41%, 42% and 43% of our Company's revenues for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our International Rx business, with the exception of our Solta products, includes sales in Canada, Europe, Asia, Australia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East of branded pharmaceutical products, branded generic pharmaceutical products and OTC products, which in aggregate accounted for approximately 14%, 13% and 13% of our Company's revenues for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
Our global Bausch + Lomb business is a fully integrated eye-health business, which we believe is critical to maintaining and developing our position in the global eye-health market. As a fully integrated eye-health business with a 165-year legacy, Bausch + Lomb has an established line of contact lenses, intraocular lenses and other medical devices, surgical systems and devices, vitamin and mineral supplements, lens care products, prescription eye-medications and other consumer products that positions us to compete in all areas of the eye-health market. 
As part of our global Bausch + Lomb business strategy, we continually look for key trends in the eye-health market to meet changing consumer/patient needs and identify areas for investment and growth. For instance, one of these trends is the increasing rate of myopia, and importantly, myopia as a potential risk factor for glaucoma, macular degeneration and retinal detachment. We continue to see increased demand for new eye-health products that address conditions brought on by factors, such as increased screen time, lack of outdoor activities and academic pressures, as well as conditions brought on by an aging population (for example, as more and more baby-boomers in the U.S. are reaching the age of 65). To supplement our well-established Bausch + Lomb product lines, we continue to identify new products tailored to address these key trends, which we develop internally with our own R&D team to generate organic growth. We also license selective molecules or technology in leveraging our own R&D expertise through development, as well as seek out external product development opportunities. Recent product launches include Biotrue® ONEday daily disposable contact lenses, the next generation of Bausch + Lomb ULTRA® contact lenses, SiHy Daily contact lenses, Lumify® (an eye redness treatment), Vyzulta® (a pressure lowering eye drop for patients with angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension) and Ocuvite® Eye Performance (vitamins to protect the eye from stressors such as sunlight and blue light emitted from digital devices). 
Currently our principal products in the eye-health business include:

Salix
The Salix segment consists of sales in the U.S. of GI products and includes our Xifaxan® product. We have been making investments in our Salix business since 2017, including: (i) hiring 200 trained and experienced sales force representatives to expand the commercial field force for Xifaxan®, (ii) increasing the focus on the development of next generation formulations of our Salix products to address new indications, (iii) completing the strategic acquisition of certain assets of Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Synergy”), which included the Trulance® product, and (iv) increasing the number of sales force representatives for Trulance®. In addition, we have entered into licensing agreements for investigational products, which, once developed and if approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA"), will be new treatments for certain GI and liver diseases and we anticipate will contribute to the future growth. Each of these opportunities potentially provides us with the ability to expand our GI portfolio and allows us to leverage our existing GI sales force, supply channel and distribution channel.
Currently our principal products in the Salix segment (including products of our third-party co-promotion partners) include:
•Xifaxan® which includes: (i) tablets indicated for the treatment of IBS-D in adults and for the reduction in risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy recurrence in adults and (ii) tablets indicated for the treatment of travelers’ diarrhea caused by noninvasive strains of Escherichia coli in patients 12 years of age and older.

Ortho Dermatologics
The Ortho Dermatologics segment consists of: (i) sales in the U.S. of Ortho Dermatologics (dermatological products) and (ii) global sales of Solta dermatological devices.
The Ortho Dermatologics business is our medical dermatology business dedicated to the treatment of a range of therapeutic areas, including aesthetics, psoriasis, actinic keratosis, acne, atopic dermatitis, onychomycosis and other dermatoses. As part of our business strategy for the Ortho Dermatologics segment, we have made significant investments to build out our psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and acne product portfolios, which are the markets within dermatology where we see the greatest opportunities, with a focus on topical gel and lotion products over injectable biologics. We continue to support the use of injectable biologics; however, we believe some patients prefer topical products as an alternative to injectable biologics. Further, as topical products can, in many cases, defer the use of injectable biologics that often come with associated risk/benefit profiles, a topical product is usually readily adopted by payors, is less expensive and can be more cost-effective than injectable biologics. Therefore, we believe topical products represent alternative treatments for physicians, payors and patients, and as the preferred choice of treatment, have the potential to drive greater volumes, generate better margins and potentially be a key contributing factor of our Ortho Dermatologics business. 
During 2017 through 2020, we have made significant investments to build out our aesthetics, psoriasis and acne product portfolios, which we believe, coupled with our experienced dermatology sales leadership team and the reorganization of our Ortho Dermatologics sales force, will position our Ortho Dermatologics business for future growth.
Currently our principal products in the medical dermatology business include:
•Jublia® (efinaconazole 10% topical solution) is a topical azole approved for the treatment of onychomycosis of the toenails (toenail fungus).

Our Solta business is dedicated to the development of innovative treatment technologies that provide proven and effective medical aesthetic and therapeutic benefits to consumers. Global Solta revenues were $253 million, $194 million and $135 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in revenue is primarily attributable to Next Generation Thermage FLX®, a fourth-generation non-invasive treatment option using a radiofrequency platform designed to optimize key functional characteristics and improve patient outcomes. During 2018 and 2019, Next Generation Thermage FLX® was launched in Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Philippines, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, China, Thailand, Vietnam, and Australia as part of our Solta medical aesthetic devices portfolio. These launches have been successful as Next Generation Thermage FLX® revenues for 2020 and 2019 were $142 million and $77 million, respectively. We expect additional launches of Next Generation Thermage FLX® in Europe in the near term, paced by country-specific regulatory registrations.

Currently our principal products in the Solta business include:
•Thermage® is a non-invasive radiofrequency treatment that can smooth, tighten and contour skin for an overall younger-looking appearance.

The Company utilizes the Diversified Products segment to extend the long-term cash flows from a number of assets that are expected to decline over time due to the loss of exclusivity, by launching and selling authorized generic versions of certain branded assets.

Our R&D expenses for 2020, 2019 and 2018, were $452 million, $471 million and $413 million, respectively. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were approximately 6% in 2020, as compared to approximately 5% in 2019 and 2018. We have rebalanced our portfolio to better align with our long-term plans and focus on core businesses. Our investment in R&D reflects our commitment to drive organic growth through internal development of new products, a pillar of our strategy. We further supplement these efforts by continually seeking out other opportunities, such as co-promotions, licensing agreements and strategic acquisitions.

See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for additional information on the risks associated with our intellectual property and proprietary rights.
Trademarks
We believe that trademark protection is an important part of establishing product and brand recognition. We own or license a number of registered trademarks and trademark applications in the U.S., Canada and in various other countries throughout the world. U.S. federal registrations for trademarks remain in force for 10 years and may be renewed every 10 years after issuance, provided the mark is still being used in commerce. Trademark registrations in Canada issued on or before June 17, 2019 remain in force for 15 years and may be renewed for 10-year terms, provided that, as in the case of U.S. federal trademark registrations, the mark is still being used in commerce. Trademark registrations in Canada issued after June 17, 2019 remain in force for 10 years and may be renewed every 10 years after issuance, provided that, as in the case of U.S. federal trademark registrations, the mark is still being used in commerce. Other countries generally have similar but varying terms and renewal policies with respect to trademarks registered in those countries.
Data and Patent Exclusivity
For certain of our products, we rely on a combination of regulatory and patent rights to protect the value of our investment in the development of these products.
A patent is the grant of a property right which allows its holder to exclude others from, among other things, selling the subject invention in, or importing such invention into, the jurisdiction that granted the patent. In the U.S., Canada and the European Union (“EU”), generally patents expire 20 years from the date of application. We have obtained, acquired or in-licensed a number of patents and patent applications covering key aspects of certain of our principal products. In the aggregate, our patents are of material importance to our business taken as a whole. 
In the U.S., the Hatch-Waxman Act provides non-patent regulatory exclusivity for five years from the date of the first FDA approval of a new drug compound in a New Drug Application (“NDA”). The FDA, with one exception, is prohibited 

during those five years from accepting for filing a generic, or an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”), that references the NDA. In reference to the foregoing exception, if a patent is indexed in the FDA Orange Book for the new drug compound, a generic may file an ANDA four years from the NDA approval date if it also files a Paragraph IV Certification with the FDA challenging the patent. Protection under the Hatch-Waxman Act will not prevent the filing or approval of another full NDA. However, the NDA applicant would be required to conduct its own pre-clinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to independently demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
A similar data exclusivity scheme exists in the EU, whereby only the pioneer drug company can use data obtained at the pioneer’s expense for up to eight years from the date of the first approval of a drug by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) and no generic drug can be marketed for ten years from the approval of the innovator product. Under both the U.S. and the EU data exclusivity programs, products without patent protection can be marketed by others so long as they repeat the clinical trials necessary to show safety and efficacy.
In the U.S., the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act ("BPCIA") allows companies to seek FDA approval to manufacture and sell biosimilar or interchangeable versions of brand name biological products. Due to the size and complexity of biological products, as compared to small molecule drugs, a biosimilar must be “highly similar” to the reference product with “no clinically meaningful differences” in safety, purity and potency between the two. The BPCIA provides reference product sponsors with 12 years (with potential for six additional months of pediatric exclusivity) of market exclusivity, but unlike the Hatch-Waxman Act which covers small molecules, it does not require reference product sponsors to list patents in an Orange Book equivalent and does not include an automatic 30-month stay of FDA approval upon the timely filing of a lawsuit. The BPCIA, however, does provide pre-litigation procedures for the parties to follow, including identification of relevant patents and each party’s basis for infringement and invalidity.  A biosimilar patent application cannot be filed until four years after the reference product is first licensed and a biosimilar cannot be launched, at the earliest (assumes no patent litigation or an adverse decision on all patents), until the expiration of the twelve years of data exclusivity from the approval of the reference product.  
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a disease or condition that affects populations of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. or a disease whose incidence rates number more than 200,000 where the sponsor establishes that it does not realistically anticipate that its product sales will be sufficient to recover its costs. The sponsor that obtains the first marketing approval for a designated orphan drug for a given rare disease is eligible to receive marketing exclusivity for use of that drug for the orphan indication for a period of seven years.
In Canada, the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations (“PM(NOC) Regulations”) create a regime analogous to the U.S. Hatch-Waxman Act, and link the regulatory approval process for generic and biosimilar drugs to the adjudication of innovator patent rights. To be eligible for protection under the PM(NOC) Regulations, patents must first be listed on the Patent Register in connection with an innovator’s drug submission to Health Canada. A generic or biosimilar manufacturer must then provide notice to the innovator of its plans to market a drug that it compared to the innovator’s patented drug in the Health Canada approval process. Within 45 days of receiving such a notice of allegation, an innovator drug company may commence patent infringement proceedings against the generic or biosimilar manufacturer. The commencement of an action by the innovator under the PM(NOC) Regulations may stay Health Canada’s regulatory approval of the generic or biosimilar drug for a period of 24 months. 
Canada also employs a data exclusivity regime for innovative drugs that provides an eight-year period of data protection from the date of market approval by Health Canada. An additional six months of data exclusivity is provided for drugs studied in clinical trials relating to use in pediatric populations. Drug submissions seeking approval based on a comparison to an innovative drug cannot be filed during the first six years of the data exclusivity period. Generic or biosimilar drug submissions remain on hold until expiry of the innovator’s data protection term, unless the innovative product is a patented drug subject to further protection under the PM(NOC) Regulations. Canada has no distinct drug submission process for biosimilar or orphan drug products.
Proprietary Know-How
We also rely upon unpatented proprietary know-how, trade secrets and technological innovation in the development and manufacture of many of our principal products. We protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and proprietary information agreements with vendors, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information.

Government Regulations 
Government authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, in Canada, in the EU and in all other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, approval, manufacturing, labeling, post-approval monitoring and reporting, packaging, advertising and promotion, storage, distribution, marketing and export and import of pharmaceutical products and medical devices. As such, our products and product candidates are subject to extensive regulation both before and after approval. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in, among other things, warning letters, civil penalties, delays in approving or refusal to approve a product candidate, product recall, product seizure, interruption of production, operating restrictions, suspension or withdrawal of product approval, injunctions or criminal prosecution.
Prior to human use, FDA approval (drugs (in the form of an NDA or ANDA for generic equivalents), biologics (in the form of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”)) and some medical devices) or marketing clearance (other devices) must be obtained in the U.S., approval by Health Canada must be obtained in Canada, EMA approval (drugs) or a CE Marking (devices) must be obtained for countries that are part of the EU and approval must be obtained from comparable agencies in other countries prior to manufacturing or marketing new pharmaceutical products or medical devices. Generally, preclinical studies and clinical trials of the products must first be conducted and the results submitted to the applicable regulatory agency (such as the FDA) for approval. 
 Regulation by other federal agencies, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration, and state and local authorities in the U.S., and by comparable agencies in certain foreign countries, is also required. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), the FDA and state and local authorities regulate the advertising of medical devices, prescription drugs, OTC drugs and cosmetics. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, sale, distribution, advertising and promotion of our products. The FDA requires a Boxed Warning (sometimes referred to as a “Black Box” Warning) for products that have shown a significant risk of severe or life-threatening adverse events and similar warnings are also required to be displayed on the product in certain other jurisdictions.
Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products and medical devices are required to comply with manufacturing regulations, including current good manufacturing practices and quality system management requirements, enforced by the FDA and Health Canada, in the U.S. and Canada respectively, and similar regulations enforced by regulatory agencies in other countries and we face annual audits of our facilities and plants and those of our contract manufacturers by the FDA and such other regulatory agencies. In addition, we are subject to price control restrictions on our pharmaceutical products in many countries in which we operate.
We are also subject to extensive U.S. federal and state health care marketing and fraud and abuse regulations, such as the federal False Claims Act, federal and provincial marketing regulations in Canada and similar regulations in foreign countries in which we may conduct our business. The federal False Claims Act imposes civil and criminal liability on individuals or entities who submit (or cause the submission of) false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government. The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal or state health care program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Some state anti-kickback laws also prohibit such conduct where commercial insurance, rather than federal or state, programs are involved. Due to recent legislative changes, violations of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute also carry potential federal False Claims Act liability. In addition, in the U.S., Canada and various other countries, companies may not promote drugs or medical devices for “off-label” uses - that is, uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those that were approved or cleared by the FDA, Health Canada or applicable regulatory agency in such other countries - and “off-label promotion” in the U.S. has also formed the predicate for False Claims Act liability resulting in significant financial settlements. These and other laws and regulations, rules and policies may significantly impact the manner in which we are permitted to market our products. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws, regulations, rules or policies or any other law or governmental regulation, or if interpretations of the foregoing change, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
We are also subject to various state, federal and international laws and regulations governing the collection, transmission, dissemination, use, privacy, confidentiality, security, retention, availability, integrity and other processing of health-related and other sensitive and personal information, including, but not limited to, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (collectively, “HIPAA”). HIPAA mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common health care transactions (e.g., health care claims information and plan eligibility, referral certification and 

authorization, claims status, plan enrollment, coordination of benefits and related information), as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information. These standards require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. Many states in which we operate have laws that protect the privacy and security of sensitive and personal information, including health-related information. Certain state laws may be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to sensitive and personal information than federal, international or other state laws, and such laws may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, imposes stringent data privacy and security requirements and obligations with respect to the personal information of California residents, including, among other things, new disclosures to California consumers and providing such consumers new data protection and privacy rights, including the ability to opt out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal data that may increase the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation. It remains unclear how various provisions of the CCPA will be interpreted and enforced, and multiple states have enacted or are expected to enact similar laws. The effects on our business of the CCPA and other similar state laws are potentially significant, and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. State laws are changing rapidly and there is discussion in Congress of a new federal data protection and privacy law to which we may be subject. 
Additionally, some statutory requirements, both in the U.S. and abroad, include obligations for companies to notify individuals of security breaches involving particular personal information, which could result from breaches experienced by us or our service providers. For example, laws in all 50 U.S. states require businesses to provide notice to customers whose personal data has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. The laws are not consistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach is difficult and may be costly. Moreover, states have been frequently amending existing laws, requiring attention to changing regulatory requirements.
Internationally, laws and regulations in many jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, transmission, dissemination, use, privacy, confidentiality, security, retention, availability, integrity and other processing of health-related and other sensitive and personal information. For example, in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) and, for the duration of the transition period (as defined below), the United Kingdom, the collection and use of personal data, including clinical trial data, is governed by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”). The GDPR became effective on May 25, 2018, repealing its predecessor directive and increasing responsibility and liability of companies in relation to the processing of personal data of EU data subjects. The GDPR, together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the EU member states and the United Kingdom governing the processing of personal data, impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze, store, transfer and otherwise process personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. In particular, the GDPR includes obligations and restrictions concerning the consent and rights of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the transfer of personal data out of the EEA or the United Kingdom, security breach notifications and the security and confidentiality of personal data. The GDPR authorizes fines for certain violations of up to 4% of global annual revenue or €20 million, whichever is greater. European data protection authorities may interpret the GDPR and national laws differently and impose additional requirements, which contributes to the complexity of processing personal data in or from the EEA or United Kingdom. Guidance on implementation and compliance practices is often updated or otherwise revised. We are also subject to Canada's federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act and substantially similar equivalents at the provincial level with respect to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information in Canada. Such federal and provincial legislation impose data privacy and security obligations on our processing of personal information of Canadian residents. The federal and Alberta legislation include mandatory data breach notification requirements. Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (“CASL”) also applies to the extent that we send commercial electronic messages from Canada or to electronic addresses in Canada. CASL contains prescriptive consent, form, content and unsubscribe mechanism requirements. Penalties for non-compliance with CASL are up to CAD 10 million per violation. These laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently over time and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and it is possible they will be interpreted and applied in ways that will materially and adversely affect our business. The regulatory framework for data privacy, data security and data transfers worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Complying with all of these laws and regulations involves costs to our business, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties, as well as litigation.
Successful commercialization of our products may depend, in part, on the availability of governmental and third-party payor reimbursement for the cost of our products. Third-party payors may include government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. In the U.S., the E.U. and other significant or potentially significant markets for our products and product candidates, government authorities and third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, which has resulted in lower average realized prices. In the U.S., these pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and health care reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. In particular, sales of our products may be subject to discounts from list price and rebate obligations, as well as formulary 

coverage decisions impacting or limiting the types of patients for whom coverage will be provided. Various U.S. health care and other laws regulate our interactions with government agencies, private insurance companies and other third-party payors regarding coverage and reimbursement for our products. Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil, criminal and administrative sanctions. In countries outside the U.S., the success of our products may depend, at least in part, on obtaining and maintaining government reimbursement because, in many countries, patients are unlikely to use prescription drugs that are not reimbursed by their governments. In addition, negotiating prices with certain governmental authorities for newly developed products can delay commercialization. In Canada and many international markets, governments control the prices of prescription pharmaceuticals, including through the implementation of reference pricing, price cuts, rebates, revenue-related taxes, tenders and profit control, and they expect prices of prescription pharmaceuticals to decline over the life of the product or as volumes increase.
In the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the health care system in ways that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “PPACA”), as amended by the Health Care Reform Act, may affect the operational results of companies in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries, including the Company and other health care related industries, by imposing on them additional costs. Although efforts at replacing the Health Care Reform Act have stalled in Congress, there are a number of proposals that we expect to be introduced to Congress and put forth by the Biden administration that may result in further changes to the health care system that could materially impact the Company.
For example, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued the “Executive Order on Strengthening Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act,” which directs federal agencies to review all existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies and any other similar agency actions that limit Americans’ access to high-quality health care, and to consider actions that will protect and strengthen Medicaid, the PPACA and access to affordable health care for every American. Under this order, federal agencies must make determinations as to whether additional actions are necessary to advance President Biden’s overall access policy and specifically examine (i) policies that may undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions, including complications related to COVID-19, (ii) demonstrations and waivers that may reduce coverage under or otherwise undermine Medicaid or the PPACA, (iii) policies that may undermine the Health Insurance Marketplace or other markets for health insurance, (iv) policies that may present unnecessary barriers to enroll in Medicaid or the PPACA and (v) policies or practices that may reduce the affordability of coverage or financial assistance for coverage, including for dependents. We cannot predict what changes will result from the Executive Order or when they will take effect, nor is it possible at this time to estimate the impact of any such changes on the Company.
See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for additional information on the risks associated with these regulations and related matters.
Environmental and Other Regulation 
Our facilities and operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations in both the U.S. and countries outside the U.S. (including Canada), including those governing the discharge of substances into the air, water and land, the handling, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, wastewater and solid waste, the cleanup of contaminated properties and other environmental matters. Certain of our development and manufacturing activities involve the use of hazardous substances. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. We are not aware of any pending environmental or occupational health and safety litigation or significant liabilities that are likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position. We cannot assure, however, that environmental liabilities relating to us or facilities owned, leased or operated by us will not develop in the future, and we cannot predict whether any such liabilities, if they were to develop, would require significant expenditures on our part. In addition, we are unable to predict what environmental or and occupational health and safety legislation or regulations may be adopted or enacted in the future. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Customers and Marketing
In 2020, the U.S. and Puerto Rico accounted for approximately 60% of our total revenue. No other country accounted for more than 5%. See Note 22, "SEGMENT INFORMATION" to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements for revenues by geographic area.

Customers that accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue for 2020, 2019 and 2018 are as follows: 

 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018
McKesson Corporation | 17% | 17% | 18% 
AmerisourceBergen Corporation | 17% | 16% | 18% 
Cardinal Health, Inc. | 13% | 14% | 13% 

We currently promote our pharmaceutical products to physicians, hospitals, pharmacies and wholesalers through our own sales force and sell through wholesalers. In some markets, we additionally sell directly to physicians, hospitals and large drug store chains and we sell through distributors in countries where we do not have our own sales staff. As part of our marketing program for pharmaceuticals, we use direct to customer advertising, direct mailings, advertise in trade, social media and medical periodicals, exhibit products at medical conventions and sponsor medical education symposia.
Competition
Competitive Landscape for Products and Products in Development
The pharmaceutical and medical device industries are highly competitive. Our competitors include specialty and other large pharmaceutical companies, medical device companies, biotechnology companies, OTC companies and generic manufacturers, in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Asia, Latin America, Middle East, Africa and in other countries in which we market our products. The dermatology competitive landscape is highly fragmented, with a large number of mid-size and smaller companies competing in both the prescription sector and the OTC and cosmeceutical sectors. With respect to the GI market, generic entrants continue to capture significant share for treatment of many GI conditions. In the area of irritable bowel syndrome ("IBS") and OIC, competitors have recently launched new competing products, which should increase the size of these markets and intensify competition. The market for Bausch + Lomb products is very competitive, both across product categories and geographies. In addition to larger diversified pharmaceutical and medical device companies, we face competition in the eye-health market from mid-size and smaller, regional and entrepreneurial companies with fewer products in niche areas or regions. 
Our competitors are pursuing the development and/or acquisition of pharmaceuticals, medical devices and OTC products that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting in dermatology, GI, eye-health and other therapeutic areas. Academic and other research and development institutions may also develop products or technologies that compete with our products, which technologies and products may be acquired or licensed by our competitors. These competitors may have greater financial, R&D or marketing resources than we do. If competitors introduce new products, delivery systems or processes with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products can be subject to progressive price reductions or decreased volume of sales, or both. Most new products that we introduce must compete with other products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors.
We sell a broad range of products, and competitive factors vary by product line and geographic area in which the products are sold. The principal methods of competition for our products include quality, efficacy, market acceptance, price and marketing and promotional efforts.
Generic Competition and Loss of Exclusivity
We face increased competition from manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products when patents covering certain of our currently marketed products expire or are successfully challenged or when the regulatory exclusivity for our products expires or is otherwise lost. Generic versions are generally significantly less expensive than branded versions, and, where available, may be required to be utilized before or in preference to the branded version under third-party reimbursement programs, or substituted by pharmacies. Accordingly, when a branded product loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product. To successfully compete for business with managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations, we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits, but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care.
For details regarding products that are facing generic competition, products that could potentially face generic competition, the corresponding potential revenue impact and infringement proceedings we initiated against potential generic competition, see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Business Trends — Generic Competition and Loss of Exclusivity” of this Form 10-K. See Note 20, "LEGAL PROCEEDINGS" to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding certain infringement proceedings. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for additional information on our competition risks.

Manufacturing 
We currently operate approximately 38 manufacturing sites worldwide and continue to make capital investments in these facilities as discussed in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview — Focus on Core Businesses” of this Form 10-K.
In the normal course of business, our products, devices and facilities are the subject of ongoing oversight and review by regulatory and governmental agencies, including general, for cause and pre-approval inspections by the relevant competent authorities where we have business operations. Through the date of this filing, all of our global operations and facilities have the relevant operational good manufacturing practices certificates and all Company products and operating sites are in good compliance standing with all relevant notified bodies and global health authorities. Further, all sites under FDA jurisdiction are rated as either No Action Indicated (where there was no Form 483 observation) or Voluntary Action Indicated (“VAI”) (where there was a Form 483 with one or more observations). In the case of VAI inspection outcomes, the FDA has accepted our responses to the issues cited, which will be verified when the agency makes its next inspection of those specific facilities. A Form 483 is issued at the end of each inspection when FDA investigators have observed any condition that in their judgment may constitute violations of current good manufacturing practices.
We also subcontract the manufacturing of certain of our products, including products manufactured under the rights acquired from other pharmaceutical companies. Products representing approximately 20% of our product sales for 2020 are produced in total, or in part, by third-party manufacturers under manufacturing arrangements.
In some cases, the principal raw materials, including active pharmaceutical ingredients, used by us (or our third-party manufacturers) for our various products are purchased in the open market or are otherwise available from several sources. However, some of the active pharmaceutical ingredients and other raw materials used in our products and some of the finished products themselves are currently only available from a single source; or others may in the future become available from only one source. For example, with respect to some of our largest or most significant products, the supply of the finished product for each of our Siliq®, Duobrii®, Bryhali®, Lumify®, Trulance®, Vyzulta®, SofLens®, Wellbutrin XL®, Ocuvite®, PreserVision®, Renu®, Xenazine®, Aplenzin®, Relistor® Oral and PureVision® products are only available from a single source and the supply of active pharmaceutical ingredient for each of our Siliq®, Duobrii®, Bryhali®, Trulance®, Vyzulta®, Xenazine®, Aplenzin®, and Relistor® Oral products are also only available from a single source. Any disruption in the supply of any such single-sourced active pharmaceutical ingredient, other raw material or finished product or an increase in the cost of such materials or products could adversely impact our ability to manufacture or sell such products, the ability of our third-party manufacturers to supply us with such products, or our profitability. We attempt to manage the risks associated with reliance on single sources of active pharmaceutical ingredient, other raw materials or finished products by carrying additional inventories or, where possible, developing second sources of supply. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for additional information on the risks associated with our manufacturing arrangements.
Our global supply team worked diligently to stay ahead of the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic once it appeared in Asia. See Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis — Impacts of COVID-19 Pandemic" for further information.
Human Capital Resources
In order to achieve our vision of being a trusted health care partner, we strive to ensure our employees around the world feel proud to be a part of Bausch Health Companies Inc.
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 21,600 employees, which included approximately 11,100 in production, 7,600 in sales and marketing, 1,600 in general and administrative positions and 1,300 in R&D. These employees are located around the world, with 7,100 in the United States and Canada, 6,500 in Europe, 2,800 in the Middle East and Africa, 2,400 in Asia-Pacific countries, 2,100 in Latin America, and 700 in Russia and Commonwealth of Independent State countries. 
Collective bargaining exists for some employees in several countries in which we do business. We consider our relations with our employees to be good and have not experienced any work stoppages, slowdowns or other serious labor problems that have materially impeded our business operations.
During fiscal 2020, our voluntary turnover rate was lower than in prior years, partially attributable to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have not experienced any significant business disruption to date as a result of turnover, and we regularly conduct an employee engagement survey globally in order to keep a pulse on the organization. Based on the survey results, we believe that our employees are proud to work for Bausch Health Companies Inc. and 87% would recommend our Company as a good place to work. 

Health, Safety and Wellness
Our employees' health, safety, and wellness are important to us. With the COVID-19 outbreak, a focus in 2020 was protecting the health and safety of our employees and their families. We broadened our existing remote work policies to enable our global employees to work from home wherever possible. In circumstances where remote work was not possible (such as at our manufacturing and distribution facilities) we implemented safety measures to ensure we prevented the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace, such as mandatory face coverings, social distancing, hand hygiene, plexiglass barriers, limited face-to-face meetings and other procedures as prescribed by global public health organizations, such as the WHO and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
On an ongoing basis, we measure how well we are fostering the health and safety of our employees through our Days Away Rate ("DAR"), which captures globally the number of days that our employees are away from work due to illness or injury. In 2020, we achieved an annual DAR of 11, which surpassed our annual goal of 13 and exceeds the industry standard of 24 days away. 
We also recognize that physical, emotional and financial wellbeing are significant contributors to our employees success at work and home, especially in 2020. We aim to support our employees in all aspects of their everyday life by centering programs and activities around these three pillars of wellbeing. Across each of these pillars, we offer a range of resources to help our employees be healthy and feel successful in both their professional and personal lives, including through employee assistance programs. For 2020, we also provided resources for our employees specifically in response to COVID-19, including launching a website – Collaborating in the New Normal – to help our employees encourage each other, lead with empathy and adapt as we navigated these unprecedented times. 
Diversity and Inclusion
We are dedicated to fostering an inclusive work environment where everyone feels welcomed, supported and valued for their talents and contributions. Our Bausch Health Diversity & Inclusion ("D&I") strategy centers on connecting our employees to our Company, each other, and our communities to cultivate a sense of trust, respect and belonging for all. We have a D&I Council that is led by our Company's Executive Committee members sponsored by our Chief Human Resources Officer, General Counsel, and Chief Medical Officer/President R&D that provides oversight for our D&I strategy and initiatives. 
We strive to advance candid conversations among our employees about racism and expanding diversity and inclusion training and education for them. Specifically, we have provided all employees with educational tools and resources to understand how to talk about these topics at work and have introduced training aimed at helping employees become more aware of unconscious biases. 
We are focused on continuing to expand our Employee Resource Groups ("ERGs"), providing opportunities for professional growth, development and informal networking. The Bausch Health Women’s Leadership Network advances the growth and leadership development of women at our Company. In 2020, they facilitated a roundtable discussion with three female members of our Executive Committee – our Chief Human Resources Officer, General Counsel, and President of our Diversified Business – to discuss their views on the most important qualities of leadership. They also hosted guest speakers focused on the importance of building resilience and practicing mindfulness, as well as effectively managing stress. Our Bausch Health Military Network Employee Resource Group was recently formed as well, and in their inaugural year they hosted a virtual Veterans Day tribute and organized a Toys for Tots drive to support local communities.
Talent Development
We are committed to the development of our employees and believe that our success coincides with our employees’ achievements of personal and professional goals. 
Through our Employee Development Framework, we endeavor to support our employees’ interests to grow to their full potential, achieve career goals, and contribute to the success of our Company. We empower employees to explore roles that are of interest and gain insights into their strengths and development needs. We provide a variety of development programs to support our employees at every stage of their career and incorporate individual development plans that aim to help our employees reach their career goals. 
We also have a robust, global succession planning process that allows us to define talent needs based on business strategy, identify talent and drive their development and growth, strengthen the pipeline for critical leadership positions, and optimize talent deployment across the business. As detailed in its charter, the Talent and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors assists the Board with oversight of our Company’s talent management and succession planning process. The Board of Directors reviews succession planning progress and specifically the plans for Executive Committee roles. To support 

this process, the Board interacts with leaders and managers throughout the organization during the year to get to know these employees and their work.
Total Rewards
Our Company’s total rewards philosophy is designed to attract, retain, motivate, and engage our employees. We provide comprehensive and market competitive compensation and benefit programs across our geographies, aligning these programs with the interests of our shareholders and balancing appropriate risk taking. Collectively, these programs comprise our Total Rewards package.
Our compensation program includes base pay, short-term incentives, and long-term incentives. We provide the opportunity for our employees to earn more when we deliver against objectives – both as a total company and individually. We also provide competitive benefit programs based on local practice in the countries where our employees work. Our programs include medical coverage, retirement benefits, paid time off, and life and other insurances. Based on local market practice in the geographies in which we operate, we also offer family planning benefits to our employees such as adoption and surrogacy assistance programs.
Corporate Social Responsibility
In 2017, we established The Bausch Foundation, which supports initiatives aimed at disease prevention, improving patient outcomes, and community support related to our core businesses. Additionally, it supports global relief efforts and those who need help in the communities in which we live and work. 
The support of our employees is essential to the success of the foundation. For example, in order to offer support to others during the pandemic, we established a campaign for our employees to donate to Feeding America, with the foundation matching up to $100,000 of these contributions. Our employees may also submit a request to the foundation for a financial contribution to support the charitable efforts of an organization they support. During 2020, the foundation, which is managed by our employees, donated medicines and health care products to assist in the global fight against the COVID-19 virus.
We are committed to supporting patients who have lost employment health benefits due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and because it is important to continue prescribed treatments, we are proud to offer certain of our prescription medicines through our Bausch Health Assistance Program. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, some people have financial obstacles that keep them from obtaining and continuing their prescribed treatments. The purpose of the Bausch Health Patient Assistance Program is to provide eligible unemployed patients in the U.S., who have lost their health insurance due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with certain of our prescription products although their financial circumstances or insurance status may otherwise interfere with their ability to do so. If approved, patients receive their Bausch Health Companies Inc. prescription product(s) at no cost to them for up to one year, and may be able to reapply to the program annually if they continue to meet eligibility requirements and have a valid prescription.
See Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis — Overview — Focus on Core Businesses — Improve Patient Access” for additional discussion regarding Company programs to address the affordability and availability of our products.
Product Liability Insurance
Since March 31, 2014, we have self-insured substantially all of our product liability risk for claims arising after that date. In the future, we will continue to re-evaluate our decision to self-insure and may purchase additional product liability insurance to cover product liability risk. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Seasonality of Business
Historically, revenues from our business tend to be weighted toward the second half of the year. Sales in the first quarter tend to be lower as patient co-pays and deductibles reset at the beginning of each year.  Sales in the fourth quarter tend to be higher based on consumer and customer purchasing patterns associated with health care reimbursement programs. However, there are no assurances that these historical trends will continue in the future. 
Geographic Areas
A significant portion of our revenues is generated from operations or otherwise earned outside the U.S. and Canada. All of our foreign operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad, including price and currency exchange controls, fluctuations in the relative values of currencies, political and economic instability and restrictive governmental actions including possible nationalization or expropriation. Changes in the relative values of currencies may materially affect our results of operations. For a discussion of these risks, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.

See Note 22, "SEGMENT INFORMATION" to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements for revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area.
A portion of our revenue and income was earned in Canada and Ireland, which have low effective tax rates. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K relating to tax rates for more information.
