Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
We are a leader in science-based approaches to developing high value crop improvements primarily in wheat, soy and hemp, designed to enhance farm economics by improving the performance of crops in the field, as well as their value as food ingredients, health and wellness products, and their viability for industrial applications. We have used advanced breeding techniques to develop these proprietary innovations which we are now commercializing through the sales of seed and grain food ingredients and products, hemp extracts, trait licensing and royalty agreements. 
 
Our commercial strategy is to satisfy consumer nutrition, health and wellness demands with the superior functional benefits our crops deliver directly from the farm, enabling us to share premium economics throughout the ag-food supply chain and to build a world-class estate of high value traits and varieties. 
 
According to ResearchandMarkets.com, the global wheat flour market in 2019 totaled $181 billion and is expected to reach $220 billion by 2027. It is also estimated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), that approximately one-quarter of the FDA recommended calories consumed by people in the US are from wheat. Therefore, the market opportunity for nutritional improvements in wheat are significant not only because the wheat market itself is vast, but also because of the “share of stomach” wheat represents. Considering that most people today are not getting enough fiber or protein in their daily diets, the superior nutrient density of our non-GM GoodWheat™ (“GoodWheat”) technology can improve the dietary intake of average consumers, by increasing their fiber and protein consumption without changing the way they eat. We believe this proprietary advantage gives GoodWheat the potential to become a global standard in wheat.

We also believe the recent legalization of hemp in the U.S. and many other areas of the world has created a significant agricultural and financial opportunity that we can participate in meaningfully. 
The market has demonstrated broad demand for industrial, nutritional, health and wellness products from hemp, yet the genetics have not yet been optimized for industrial scale production setting up a vast, new opportunity for Arcadia to add value to the industry through  seed and extract offerings.
 
The passage of the U.S. Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 – also known as the Farm Bill – confirmed the federal legalization of hemp, the term given to non-psychoactive cannabis containing less than 0.3% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). It also included provisions for legalizing on a federal level hemp’s cultivation, transport and sale for the first time in more than 75 years. Hemp, not previously distinguished by the federal government from cannabis, a Schedule 1 drug and banned as an agricultural crop, lacks substantive plant biology research and is limited by suboptimal genetics, highly fragmented germplasm and performance inconsistencies. We are targeting hemp-based solutions that allow farmers to reliably and consistently achieve compliance with USDA regulations, through varieties with improved functionality and application of specific attributes such as select cannabinoid contents for health and wellness, enhanced proteins profiles for plant-based dietary applications and industrial applications such as clothing and hempcrete. Arcadia conducts its business in only federal and state markets in which its activities are legal.
 
In addition to bringing new hemp varieties to market, we also see an attractive opportunity to service the growing consumer demand for CBD and other hemp-derived cannabinoids. According to a New Frontier Data report issued in March 2020, U.S. consumer spending on CBD is projected to grow from an estimated $14B USD in 2020 to $26B USD in 2025 with global demand accelerating significantly as countries formalize regulatory frameworks for the industry. Backed by our own consumer survey data, we believe our premium Hawaiian grown hemp provides a unique value proposition to consumers that will enable us to rapidly gain traction in the marketplace as we grow our B2B and branded retail business channels.

Arcadia GoodWheat™
 In 2018, we launched our GoodWheat brand, a non-genetically modified (non-GM) portfolio of wheat products that enables food manufacturers to differentiate their consumer-facing brands. Consumer food companies are looking to simplify their food ingredient formulations and consumers are demanding “clean labeling” in their foods, paying more for foods having fewer artificial ingredients and more natural, recognizable and healthy ingredients. A 2017 survey by PR agency Ingredient Communications found that 73% of consumers are happy to pay a higher retail price for a food or drink product made with ingredients they recognize. Because GoodWheat increases the nutrient density directly in the primary grains and oils, it provides the mechanism for food formulation simplification naturally and cost effectively to meet evolving consumer demands.
 The brand launch is a key element of the company’s go-to-market strategy to achieve greater value for its innovations by participating in downstream consumer revenue opportunities. We designed the brand to make an immediate connection with consumers that products made with GoodWheat meet their demands for healthier wheat options that also taste great. The GoodWheat brand encompasses our current and future non-GM wheat portfolio of high fiber Resistant Starch (RS) and Reduced Gluten wheat varieties, as well as future wheat innovations. In October 2019, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted us the latest patents for extended shelf life wheat, the newest trait in our non-genetically modified wheat portfolio. This new trait was designed to promote whole wheat consumption by improving the shelf life and taste of whole grain wheat products.
 With additional patents granted in 2020 we now hold more than 15 global patents on our high fiber Resistant Starch wheat, protecting both bread wheat and durum (pasta) wheat. Claims granted recently strengthen our intellectual property for our Resistant Starch portfolio of products.
 We announced in August 2019 an agreement with Bay State Milling Company and Arista Cereal Technologies to bring to market our resistant starch GoodWheat in North America and other key markets, beginning in late 2019.  In the daily American diet approximately 500 calories come from wheat products, 25% of the FDA’s recommended daily caloric intake for a woman and 20% for a man. The GoodWheat portfolio of specialty wheat varieties deliver new functional value through an ingredient already an important component of the human diet.
 Arcadia GoodHemp™
 
In December 2019, we announced the launch of a new product line, GoodHemp, as the company's new commercial brand for delivering hemp seeds, transplants, flower and extracts. The acquisition of Industrial Seed Innovations (“ISI”) in August 2020 brought ISI’s portfolio of strong performing, federally compliant hemp varieties to Arcadia’s GoodHemp™ catalog. ISI’s popular Umpqua and Rogue seed varieties each bring unique and highly desirable characteristics to further differentiate Arcadia’s GoodHemp catalog. We have since introduced another variety, Santiam, to the market, and have built a pipeline that is expected to deliver new commercial varieties on an annual basis. 
 
By 2025, the Brightfield Group, a hemp and CBD market research firm, projects U.S. sales of hemp-based CBD to reach $16.8 billion. Additionally, Markets and Markets estimates the non-cannabinoid, industrial hemp global market will exceed $26 billion by 2025.
 
In future years, we expect to bring to market proprietary and patent-protected varieties of hemp designed for their utility as fiber and hemp-based protein.  While the addressable market for hemp in these markets still remains to be determined, it can be estimated that hemp would compete favorably for share in the $40.6 billion global protein extract and isolated protein market forecast in 2025 (source: MarketsandMarkets).
 Verdeca HB4® Soybean
 In 2012, we partnered with Bioceres, Inc. (“Bioceres”) an Argentina-based technology company, to form Verdeca LLC, (“Verdeca”) a U.S.-based joint venture company to deploy next-generation soybean traits developed to benefit soybean producers through quality improvement, stress mitigation and management practices. The HB4® soybean varieties deliver two layers of value for growers: drought and herbicide tolerance, offering resistance to a broad-spectrum herbicide utilized to prevent growth of a wide range of annual and perennial broadleaf weeds and grasses. 
 3



In November 2020, we sold our membership interest in Verdeca to Bioceres in a transaction in which we received cash, shares of Bioceres stock and a royalty stream of up to $10 million on HB4 soybean sales. An additional $2 million in cash is to be paid upon achievement by Verdeca of specific regulatory or commercial milestones. See Note 9 for more information regarding the consideration received.
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
We believe there are significant opportunities to grow our business by executing the following elements of our strategy:
  
• | Scale up our GoodHemp seed sales, develop and introduce novel genetics in hemp. Arcadia has acquired superior germplasm, and through its own breeding program developed a suite of quality hemp seed varieties and is adding to its catalogue by developing more novel, compliant hemp seed varieties possessing productivity, pest resistance and crop quality attributes for license to cultivators, and for derivative products serving the nutraceutical and food industries. Because of our proven ability to develop innovative traits in some of the most complex plant genomes such as wheat, we believe turning our attention to the critical needs facing the rapidly evolving hemp industry greatly enhances our growth markets. In parallel, we are evaluating key partnerships to extend our capabilities vertically to maximize the value creation potential of our innovations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Accelerate the commercialization of our health and nutrition trait portfolio. In 2019, we introduced resistant starch and reduced gluten varieties of GoodWheat to the market and are scaling sales in 2021, working with multiple public breeding platforms and continuing to build partnerships across the wheat value chain, having met the FDA requirement for “high in fiber” and “good source of fiber” designations. We launched a product portfolio of GoodWheat pasta and flour products under the Three Farm Daughters brand with Three Farm Daughters LLLP, that includes artisan linguine, fusilli and fettuccine pasta, in addition to 100% wheat flour. There are more products in the pipeline as we continue to invest in our human resources and commercialization capabilities. As we become more consumer facing and commercially aligned with consumer food companies, greater in-house consumer product knowledge and industry experience will be required. We will continue to invest in acquisition, development and retention of the requisite management and industry experience and production and logistics capacity to fully participate in, and control, the route to market for our high value food ingredients. We will continue to build our commercialization expertise, refine go-to-market strategies and execute branding strategy.

Our Products and Product Development Pipeline
 
We have improved the quality and nutritional value of plant-based ingredients while improving production efficiency using advanced plant breeding technologies and accelerating innovation through industry leading partners.  Our innovations address the challenges facing our food systems as depicted below: 
 

We believe our core competencies in plant genomics position Arcadia for unique innovations in new crops. We leverage a research and development team that has over 100 years of combined experience across best in class technology platforms. Our competitive advantages allow for accelerated discovery and market entry.
 GoodWheat 
 Enhanced Quality Grains
 
Our GoodWheat brand redesigns wheat as a functional food adding value to the wheat supply chain by enabling a wider range of choices to meet consumer demands. We believe our GoodWheat products will allow consumers to enjoy unique health benefits in their favorite foods featuring wheat. Our GoodWheat product allows consumer food companies to deliver specialty products to discerning consumers. We have multiple programs aimed at developing wheat and other small grains with improved nutritional qualities. One such program generated multiple bread wheat and pasta wheat lines with very high levels of amylose, leading to increased levels of resistant starch. Resistant starch increases the total dietary fiber content of wheat and reduces its glycemic index, which are both desirable nutritional qualities that are important in the management of diabetes and healthy blood glucose levels. High fiber Resistant Starch wheat can deliver fiber and other benefits to refined white flour products and also whole grain food products. In 2016, the FDA approved the use of qualified health claims for corn-based resistant starch in the risk reduction of type-2 diabetes, thus establishing a key precedent for the health benefits associated with this fiber. According to the USDA’s What We Eat in America Survey of 2015-2016, only 5% of the U.S. population meets the recommended level of dietary fiber.  On average, Americans consume only 57% of the daily recommended levels. We believe improving the fiber content of wheat can deliver improved health benefits to a wide population.
 
A second program, in collaboration with Ardent Mills, aims at improving the flavor profile and shelf-life of whole wheat. A third program is aimed at reducing gluten in wheat and other grains. This program additionally targets improved protein quality and amino acid profile in wheat. All of these programs utilize our TILLING platform, and the resulting products are non-GM.

High Fiber Resistant Starch Wheat 
 
Our high fiber resistant starch (RS) wheat provides a source of wheat with inherently high levels of resistant starch, increasing the total dietary fiber content of food products without the need for fiber additives from other sources. Currently, corn resistant starch is a product in two market segments: dietary fiber additives and modified starch additives. According to MarketsandMarkets, the global dietary fibers market is projected to reach $6.5 billion by 2022 and the modified starch market is projected to reach $12.4 billion in 2022. Major growth in these markets is being driven by the convenience health food sector and functional food sector. Flour from our RS wheat lines has resistant starch levels that are 12 to 20 times higher than the control wheat, and total dietary fiber, or TDF, which is more than eight times higher than the control. RS wheat flour has been tested in applications in bread, where loaf quality was comparable to bread made with conventional wheat flour, and pasta, where it had the highest consumer preference rankings in tests carried out by a major consumer products company.
 
RS wheat flour is currently being introduced to North American bakery and CPG companies by our partners, Bay State Milling.  In markets outside North America, RS wheat is currently being tested in a range of additional bakery, ready-to-eat cereals and pasta products with industrial partners. We have many RS wheat lines that are being evaluated for optimal quality and agronomic characteristics.
 Improved Shelf Life of Whole Grain Flour
 The USDA recommends that “at least one serving of grains per day must be whole grain-rich” due to evidence that a diet containing whole grains provides a multitude of benefits, including lower risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type-2 diabetes. Despite these health benefits, consumption of whole grain products is negatively affected by the bitter and rancid flavors and odors that accumulate in whole wheat flour after milling. Our improved stability and flavor wheat lines greatly reduced the production of rancid and bitter compounds in milled whole grain flour as it progresses through the supply chain. Whole wheat flour from these lines is being tested further for sensory characteristics and improved shelf life stability. This new trait could help improve the shelf life and flavor profile of whole grain products, thus reducing formulation costs and increasing consumer preference and palatability for whole grains.
Reduced Gluten (RG) Wheat
 
Many consumers are interested in reducing levels of gluten in their diet. Critically, for some, this is due to having Celiac disease (CD), an autoimmune disease that impacts many people worldwide with estimates from 1% of the population in Europe to 3.5% in Mexico. Furthermore, non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) impacts an estimated additional 6% of the population. Both CD and NCGS are characterized by sensitivity to dietary gluten. The only effective treatment of CD and NCGS requires removal of gluten sources from the diet. Since required adherence to a gluten-free diet is extremely difficult to accomplish for average consumers, efforts to develop alternative approaches are needed.
 
Research conducted by the Connell Group in 2018 indicates there is a significant portion of consumers (26% of general population) that choose to reduce gluten levels in their diet despite not having Celiac disease.  Further internal qualitative research conducted in 2019 identified a valuable consumer segment recognized as “Gluten Reducers” who aspire to reduce gluten but are not strict gluten-free.
 
Arcadia is continuing to advance a new wheat variety with reduced gluten levels. Our proprietary, non-GM wheat variety developed using advanced screening and plant breeding techniques have reduced allergenic glutens and increased essential amino acids such as lysine, along with all the other health benefits of high protein wheat.  Importantly, this variety also delivers impressively high fiber content at approximately 14 grams per serving compared to 2-3 grams per serving of traditional wheat, providing additional value to health-conscious consumers as well as optionality as we advance the commercialization of this project. We are breeding the trait into additional commercial wheat varieties and working with food processors to give people a choice to enjoy higher quality wheat in the products they love while reducing gluten in their diet.

Innovative hemp varieties
 
GoodHemp is our commercial pipeline of superior non-GMO hemp seed varieties. The varieties improve plant quality and productivity, working within federal legal guidelines. GoodHemp products deliver superior emergence and growth characteristics and are available as both seeds and seedlings. Our seed and clone specifications meet compliance requirements because of their low THC profiles, in addition to a multitude of other beneficial characteristics.
 
With the acquisition of Industrial Seed Innovations (“ISI”) in August 2020, ISI’s portfolio of strong performing hemp varieties became part of Arcadia’s GoodHemp catalog. Umpqua is a CBD dominant variety that is designed to mature earlier than most existing varieties making it very attractive for northern latitudes. Rogue on the other hand is designed to mature later in the season resulting in ultra-high yielding plants in lower latitude geographies with longer growing seasons. We have since released Santiam, a CBD dominant variety designed for performance for the grower unique appeal to the consumer.
 
In February 2021 four GoodHemp varieties, Umpqua, Rogue, Santiam and Potomac were evaluated and received approval by the National Association of Official Seed Certifying Agencies (AOSCA) variety review board. This represented a significant milestone serving as independent validation that our GoodHemp varieties are distinct, uniform and genetically stable. This certification also enables these GoodHemp varieties to be exported and sold in Canada through our distribution partner Tritium 3H, pending approval from Health Canada.
 Nutritional Oils
 Gamma Linolenic Acid (GLA) Oil
 Under a license agreement with Abbott Laboratories, we developed a new source of vegetable oil with very high levels of gamma linolenic acid, or GLA, an omega-6 fatty acid. To our knowledge, our GLA safflower oil product has the highest concentration of GLA available in any plant oil at 65%; conventional plant oils range from 10 to 22% GLA. We sell the oil in the United States to manufacturers of dietary supplements, nutritional supplements, medical foods, dog food, and other products. GLA safflower oil is also approved in Canada as a natural health product. Our key customers include significant participants in those markets. As part of a series of transactions with Bioceres in November 2020, we extended an exclusive license for future GLA production and sales to Bioceres and will continue to sell the inventory we have on hand.
 
 GLA has multiple clinically demonstrated nutritional and medical benefits, including anti-inflammatory effects, improving skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and healthy weight management. Our GLA oil may be beneficial when incorporating it into certain foods, dietary supplements, or medical products where conventional sources of GLA are not sufficiently concentrated to deliver amounts that are cost- and performance-effective. 
 
Joint Ventures
 Verdeca
 In 2012, we partnered with Bioceres, an Argentina-based technology company, to form Verdeca, a U.S.-based joint venture company to deploy next-generation soybean traits, of which we own 50%. We selected Bioceres as our partner in soybeans, the world’s fourth largest crop by area grown, due to their desirable trait portfolio, their presence in key South American markets, and the significant presence of large soybean growers in their ownership structure. In November, 2020, we sold our membership interest in Verdeca to Bioceres in a transaction in which we received cash, shares of Bioceres stock and a royalty stream of up to $10 million on HB4 soybean sales. An additional $2 million in cash is to be paid upon achievement by Verdeca of specific regulatory or commercial milestones. 
Archipelago Ventures Hawaii, LLC
 
In August 2019, we formed a new joint venture to serve the Hawaiian, North American and Asian hemp markets, Archipelago Ventures Hawaii, LLC (“Archipelago”). This new venture between Arcadia and Legacy Ventures Hawaii (“Legacy”) combines Arcadia’s extensive genetic expertise and seed innovation history with Legacy’s growth capital and strategic advisory expertise in the Hawaiian markets. Additionally, Legacy brings to the 
 7


partnership years of proven success in extraction, product formulation and sales of cannabinol oil and distillate products through its equity partner, Vapen CBD. Legacy was originally formed to be a vehicle for its partners to pursue hemp opportunities within the Hawaiian Islands. 
 
Archipelago creates a vertically integrated supply chain, from seed to sale, we believe the first of its kind in Hawaii, and has three important strategic imperatives: (1) ensure a reliable supply chain during critical scale up of the global hemp market, a major risk mitigation for success, (2) ensure high quality throughout the supply chain, from genetics to the field and field to the customer, and (3) ensure being well-positioned to address the unique needs and opportunities of the Hawaiian market. 
 
Research and Development
 Product Development Platforms 
 With our food and wellness products now entering the market, we are firmly in the commercialization phase of our corporate lifecycle. Moreover, our proven platform technologies in wheat and hemp have broad application across multiple new food and product executions representing significant value enhancement potential. For example, our Three Farm Daughter’s pasta and flour products are just two out of potentially hundreds where our nutrition dense GoodWheat can meaningfully improve the nutrition panel and provide cleaner labels on foods like crackers, snack bars, pancakes, and breads, just to name a few. Therefore, we are de-emphasizing new trait discovery R&D and are increasing our focus on food-science innovation to fully leverage the value in our exiting superior wheat and hemp genetics. We are evolving our organizational capabilities to match this strategy progression to include in-house food formulation and CPG supply chain expertise. 
 Our R&D program to date has been centered around ArcaTech, our proprietary, rapid prototyping and product development pipeline, focused on trait discovery. It is from this system we developed the base platform traits and technologies which we can now leverage as the basis for innovating new food and wellness ingredients to serve the vast addressable markets in wheat and hemp. Therefore, the primary focus of our R&D platform will now be food science innovation, nutrition and wellness product innovation. We will still have residual breeding and introgression work to perform as we complete the agricultural requirements for traits existing in our R&D programs as well new food formulations require.
 Food Formulation Innovation. We will expand the application of our innovation platform to build on our pipeline of products focused on health and wellness. Our innovation team is focused on using science-based solutions to leverage our wheat and hemp varieties to develop an array of food products and wellness ingredients. Because we are innovating from directly from our own well-established plant technology traits, we expect this extension of our involvement will provide more meaningful improvements. Through this extended application of the innovation platform, it enables us to be involved in multiple parts of the value chain to ensure the final products adequately capture the spectrum of enriched performance. With our hyper-focused team of scientists, researchers, technicians and chefs, we are positioned to accelerate our reach as wheat and hemp offer unique opportunities for innovative product launches.
 
Controlled plant growth. The controlled plant growth group manages our growth chamber facilities, where plants are grown under precisely controlled conditions, and our greenhouse facility, consisting of approximately 26,000 square feet of high-quality greenhouse space.  They also carry out a number of essential functions to support breeding and prototype evaluation including the phenotypic evaluation of plants, controlled crosses, accelerated breeding protocols, rapid phenotyping as well as conducting seed increases for commercial sale. Additionally, for hemp projects, this team manages our cannabinoid chemistry pipeline, which enables high throughput characterization of cannabinoids and terpenes across all research hemp populations. Our growth chamber facilities are located at our headquarters in Davis, California, and our greenhouses are located nearby in Yolo county California.
 
Molecular analysis and accelerated breeding. The molecular analysis team plays a critical role in enabling the rapid deployment of our traits into commercially relevant germplasm by deploying genetic markers to track our proprietary gene alleles as we introgress them into new germplasm. This enables us to rapidly develop and select lines for advancement into field evaluation and to expand the commercial offerings of our GoodWheat product lines.

Research, Field Trials, Breeder & Foundation Seed Production. Our trait evaluation and development group is based in Davis, California and conducts remote field operations in American Falls, Idaho; Yuma, Arizona; Brawley, California and multiple locations in Montana, North Dakota, Oregon and Washington. The trait evaluation and development group have extensive field and specialized statistical analytical capabilities that we deploy to support field trial execution and data analysis internally and with our collaborators. Late-stage regional and agronomic trials are intended to develop extensive data on a limited number of potential commercial plant varieties and develop the best crop management practices suited for these commercial products. Similarly, regulatory trials develop data for use in submissions for regulatory review and may involve plant varieties developed by our collaborators or our own oil quality and grain quality programs.
 
Commercial Seed, and Grain Production.  The commercial development group is based in Davis, California. The group conducts grower field trials and manages the commercial seed and grain production throughout the United States working through seed production specialists and growers and elsewhere globally with our collaborators and joint venture partners.  Grower field evaluations are designed to test new commercial seed varieties for yield and agronomic performance and as well as characterizing performance of seed and grain quality attributes.
Regulatory Data Generation. Our Analytical Services and Regulatory Science group is located in Davis, California and provides automated DNA preparations, genomic blot analyses, lipid profiling, metabolomics and protein purification services and develops data for use in product selection and validation, certification of SONOVA, GoodWheat and other product specifications, and regulatory submissions. These data support regulatory submissions and provide core trait regulatory packages to our collaborators for use in their crop-specific regulatory applications. 
Biological Materials Inventory and Tracking. Our proprietary Pedigree and Inventory Management System, or PIMS, tracks the genetic, phenotypic and location information for all our plant materials. PIMS encompasses genetic elements such as genes and promoters, GM seeds and plant material received by us, as well as seeds and plants developed by us and used in trait development. The performance of our plant materials is recorded through a variety of laboratory and field observations, and the data are stored within PIMS. The location of all plant materials is tracked throughout the plant life cycle. This includes specific seeds planted within a specific plot of a specific field trial, harvest, seed storage location and use by, or distribution of plant material to, our collaborators or elsewhere. PIMS interfaces with our Biotechnology Quality Management System, or BQMS, to manage all movement and release of regulated GM plant materials. This ensures all our plant materials are accounted for, tracked and inventoried, which enables us to maintain control over and documentation of all plant materials.
Intellectual Property
 We rely on patents and other proprietary right protections, including trade secrets and contractual protection of our proprietary know-how and confidential information, to preserve our competitive position.
 As of December 31, 2020, and in summary, we owned or exclusively controlled 109 issued patents and 61 pending patent applications worldwide.  These totals reflect the following:  (i) with respect to the U.S. territory, we owned 20 and exclusively in-licensed 4 U.S. issued patents, and we owned 10 U.S. patent applications relating to our trait technologies and business methods; and (ii) in connection with foreign territories, we owned 25 and exclusively in-licensed 59 foreign issued patents, and owned 50 pending foreign patent applications.  With respect to all of the foregoing patent assets, our exclusive licenses afford us control over the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents and patent applications. These numbers do not include in-licensed patents for which we either do not have exclusive rights (such as certain enabling technology licenses), or for which we have exclusive rights only in a limited field of use or do not control prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents.
 As of December 31, 2020, we had eight registered trademarks in the United States and also six registered trademarks in various other countries.

Key Collaborations
 We have established numerous trait collaborations and have developed close relationships with industry-leading seed and consumer product companies. Our partnerships with global strategic seed and consumer product players enable us to further participate in the development and commercialization of innovative products that promise to play significant roles in improving global crop efficiency and enhancing human health. We believe that the expertise and opportunities created by these collaborations represent important assets to our business. Below is a summary of selected collaborative partnerships that we view as key to the achievement of our near-term and mid-term business objectives.
Ardent Mills
 
In November 2018, we announced our collaboration with Ardent Mills, LLC to develop and commercialize wheat innovations.  Ardent Mills, LLC is North America’s leading flour-milling and ingredient company. Our first project focuses on extending the shelf life and improving the flavor of whole wheat products.
 
By using patented Arcadia trait technology, the storage life of whole wheat flour can be extended by slowing the enzymatic processes that reduce shelf life. Because milled flour from wheat carrying Arcadia’s trait technology oxidizes more slowly, it also minimizes the bitterness associated with most whole wheat products. This trait is expected to help improve the taste of whole wheat products and help reduce waste.
 
The extended shelf life wheat trait was developed using our proprietary non-GM wheat genetic diversity TILLING library, an extensive and exclusive resource of trait lines with high-density variations in genetic composition and gene function. Because it is non-GM, the trait has wide application potential across both conventional and organic farming practices. We recently received a U.S. patent for the technology which extends the storage life of whole wheat flour by minimizing oxidation, the latest in our portfolio of wheat trait improvements.  We will continue further collaboration with Ardent Mills, LLC and university partners to bring this trait to commercialization in products.
 Corteva Agriscience
 In August 2017, we entered into a new strategic collaboration with Corteva AgriScience to jointly develop and commercialize a breakthrough improved wheat quality trait in North America. The collaboration leverages our TILLING platform with Corteva Agriscience’s enabling technology platforms, high-quality elite germplasm and global commercial channels.
 Under the collaboration, the companies will further develop and commercialize an improved wheat quality trait, which has completed initial field trials and is advancing to next-stage field trials. Corteva AgriScience will introgress Arcadia’s trait into its proprietary elite germplasm lines and manage all aspects related to the trait commercialization. Certain development costs will be co-funded, and we will share in the commercial value resulting from products produced.
 Arista Cereal Seeds Pty Ltd and Bay State Milling Company
 
In August 2019, we entered into a binding term sheet with Arista and BSM to resolve the parties’ disputes, including the Delaware Action and the 716 Interference proceeding.  Under the binding term sheet, Bay State Milling Company will become the exclusive commercial partner for our high fiber wheat in North America under Bay State Milling’s HealthSense™ brand portfolio, while Arista receives exclusive rights under our high fiber wheat intellectual property in certain geographies, including Australia and Europe. We will continue to market our high fiber wheat under our GoodWheat portfolio of specialty wheat ingredients in other international markets. In December 2019, the three parties entered into a settlement agreement reflecting the terms of the binding term sheet.
Competition
 The markets for seed traits and agricultural biotechnology products are highly competitive, and we face significant direct and indirect competition in several aspects of our business. Competition for improving plant 
 10


genetics comes from conventional and advanced plant breeding techniques, as well as from the development of advanced biotechnology traits. Other potentially competitive sources of improvement in crop yields include improvements in crop protection chemicals, fertilizer formulations, farm mechanization, other biotechnology, and information management. Programs to improve genetics and chemistry are generally concentrated within a relatively small number of large companies, while non-genetic approaches are underway with broader set of companies.
 In general, we believe that our competitors generally fall into the following categories:
  
• | Specialty health and nutrition ingredient companies: In response to the growing consumer demand for healthier food alternatives, a number of agricultural and food-based companies are augmenting their product and market strategies to bring new quality food ingredients to market. Calyxt, Inc. (formerly known as Cellectis Plant Sciences, Inc) is an agriculture biotechnology company that has a similar strategy as ours and is using gene-editing technology to create healthier specialty food ingredients and agriculturally advantageous food crops.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Large Agricultural Biotechnology, Seed, and Chemical Companies: According to Phillips McDougall, the leading 10 seed and trait companies as a group invested $3.9 billion in seed and trait research and development in 2017. This includes conventional and advanced plant breeding, as well as biotechnology and gene-editing trait development. According to Phillips McDougall, only a limited number of companies have been actively involved in new trait discovery, development, and commercialization: Corteva (formerly DuPont Pioneer and Dow), Syngenta, BASF, Bayer (including former Monsanto), KWS, and Genective (a joint venture between KWS and Limagrain). Many of these companies have substantially larger budgets for gene discovery, research, development, and product commercialization than we do. Some of these companies also have substantial resources and experience managing the regulatory process for new GM seed traits. Each of Corteva, Syngenta, and Bayer, which accounted for 87% of the 2017 seed trait research and development spend noted above, also have significant chemical crop protection background and businesses. The trait pipelines of these companies are heavily weighted toward biotic stress traits, although they also have significant programs aimed at development of abiotic stress traits and increasingly on output traits such as nutritional content. While these companies have internal programs that may compete with our own, they also seek new traits externally and, as such, some of them either currently are, or may in the future be, our collaborators.

• | Trait Research and Development Companies: There are a number of companies that specialize in research and development of agricultural yield and product quality traits, and we believe that a dozen or more companies, including Ebbu (acquired by Cannopy Growth), Front Range Biosciences, Segra, Yield 10, Arista, Benson Hill Biosystems, Evogene, Keygene, Oregon CBD, High Grade Hemp, and Trilogene, among others, are competitors in our field. We believe that these companies typically focus on a limited number of traits, and do not generally have the product development and regulatory infrastructure necessary to bring traits to market. Therefore, we believe they typically license trait technologies to large industry players with in-house development and regulatory capabilities at a relatively early stage of development. In the development of nutritional traits using non-GM methods, companies like Calyxt and Arista Cereal Technologies are competitors who are also developing quality traits in wheat and other crops.

• | Companies Focused on the Development and Commercialization of Microbial Crop Enhancements: The use of microbial products to enhance crop performance via application to soil, seed, or to crops directly is an area where increased research and development activity has been underway for the past decade or more. We believe that there are more than 20 companies of varying size working in this space. There have been a number of acquisitions, including Becker Underwood by BASF, and joint collaborations in this space but multiple independent companies remain, including Verdesian, Marrone Bioinnovations, Biagro Agrinos, Indigo Agriculture, and Bioconsortia. While these companies could be considered to compete with us as their products seek to improve crop yields, we believe that such products and our traits may be additive, or synergistic, to our future products in terms of increasing crop yields.

• | Producers of feminized hemp seed: Within the nascent hemp seed industry, there have been numerous producers of hemp seed, both large and small, not able to weather the volatility in the market. A few of the producers remaining whom we consider competitors include Oregon CBD, Front Range Biosciences, Trilogene Seeds and High-Grade Hemp Seed, Hemptown USA, among others.

• | Companies Selling Wheat Products: As we enter the direct to consumer and retail markets with our GoodWheat products, we believe we face significant competition from a variety of consumer-packaged goods companies. Our competitors in the pasta market range from companies like Banza and Ancient Harvest who offer high-nutrition pasta alternatives to large, traditional pasta producers including Barilla and De Cecco. We will face similar competition with our flour products.
