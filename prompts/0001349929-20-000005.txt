According to the National Cancer Institute, since the 1990s, cancer death rates in the United States have declined 23%, and approximately 83% of life expectancy increases in cancer patients are due to new treatments and oncology medications.
Outside of the United States, growth in the pharmaceuticals and clinical trials market is continuing, and trials are increasingly becoming more complex. Growth in the European pharma market is anticipated to be driven largely by the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, France and Italy. The size of this market is expected to grow 25% between 2017 and 2022, accounting for nearly 70% of the European pharma market by 2022. 
While oncology drugs have the potential to be among the most personalized therapeutics, very few successfully make it to market. The application of pharmacogenomics to oncology clinical trials enables researchers to better predict differences, initially driven by data derived in preclinical research. The Company believes a growing demand for faster development of personalized medicines and more effective clinical trials are growth drivers of this market, and its core expertise is preclinical efficacy, toxicity and bioanalytical services. 
More specific to the Company's targeted markets around the world, according to Market Insight Reports (October 2019) the global oncology-based in-vivo CRO market was valued at over $799 million in 2018 and is projected to reach $1.47 billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 7.9% from 2019 to 2026. The major factors contributing to the growth of this market include the rising incidence of cancer cases worldwide, the rise in the geriatric population, the increasing number of specific therapies in the oncology pipeline and the presence of large numbers of pipeline drugs. The number of late-stage pipeline therapies rose from 711 in 2017 to 849 in 2018, representing an increase of 19%, and the use of oncology-based in-vivo CRO helps in deriving the novel therapies for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment to patients. Oncology is one of the most studied indication areas, as per the statistics available from government agencies around the world. Other factors that are playing a key role in driving growth in the oncology-based in-vivo CRO business include greater federal funding for research studies and increasing research expertise in the industry.
The Company has a particularly strong set of experiences working in the preclinical area of checkpoint inhibitors and specifically immunotherapies. Drug development is continuing to attract biotech companies transforming scientific innovation into practice-changing cancer drugs, thereby driving demand for the Company's services. When considering druggable targets within the different immuno-oncology drug classes, T cell immunomodulators and cell therapies had the largest increase in new targets in the past 2 years, which suggests that more innovation is going into these drug classes than the other IO drug classes. Overall, active drugs in development has grown from 2,030 to 3,876, a 91% increase in just 2 years, resulting in more than 3,400 active clinical trials evaluating such agents, 66% of all active immuno-oncology drugs in development.

The Company is implementing measures to streamline costs across its laboratory facilities, integrating administrative functions across its global operations, implementing a cloud-based laboratory management system across all of its sites, along with key financial enterprise resource planning and human resource systems that enable greater efficiency.

The Company's Service Offerings
Prior to the Business Disposals, the Company's business was based on demand for molecular- and biomarker-based characterization of cancers from three main sectors: (1) biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, (2) cancer centers and hospitals, and (3) the research community. With the Company's continued focus on the preclinical market, its services are primarily sought by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies engaged in designing and preparing to run clinical trials, for their value and efficacy in oncology and immuno-oncology treatments and therapeutics. The Company believes trial participants' likelihood of experiencing either favorable or adverse responses to the trial treatment can be determined first by its extended portfolio of orthotopic, xenografts and syngeneic tumor test systems, and in early development through biomarker identification and development, thereby increasing trial efficiency, participant safety and trial success rates. Biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies also seek the Company's services in preclinical trial design and drug development, in order to effectively and efficiently select those therapeutic candidates most likely to progress to clinical treatment options. The Company's services are also sought by researchers and research groups seeking to identify biomarkers and panels and develop methods for diagnostic technologies and tests for disease. 
Discovery Services 
Through its acquisition of vivoPharm in 2017, the Company offers proprietary preclinical test systems valued by the pharmaceutical industry, biotechnology companies and academic research centers. In particular, the Company's preclinical development of biomarker detection methods, response to immuno-oncology directed novel treatments and early prediction of clinical outcome is supported by its extended portfolio of orthotopic, xenografts and syngeneic tumor test systems. vivoPharm specializes in conducting studies tailored to guide drug development, starting from compound libraries and ending with a comprehensive set of in vitro and in vivo data and reports, as needed for Investigational New Drug filing. vivoPharm operates in AAALAC accredited and GLP-compliant audited facilities. The Company provides its preclinical services, with a focus on efficacy models, from its Hershey, PA facility for the U.S. and European markets, and supplemented with GLP toxicology and extended bioanalytical services in its Australia-based facility in Clayton, VIC and Gilles Plains, SA (effective in February 2020).
The Company's Discovery Services provide the tools and testing methods for companies and researchers seeking to identify new molecular- and biomarker-based indicators for disease and to determine the pharmacogenomics, toxicity and efficacy of potential therapeutic candidate compounds. Discovery Services offered include development of both xenograft and syngeneic animal models, 
6

toxicology and genetic toxicology services, pharmacology testing, pathology services, and validation of biomarkers for diseases including cancers. The Company also provides consulting, guidance and preparation of samples and clinical trial design. The Company believes the ability to analyze variations in biomarkers, tumor cells and compounds, and to interpret results into meaningful predictors of disease or indicators of therapeutic success is essential to discovering new molecular markers for cancer, new therapeutics, and targets for therapies.
Retained Tests
The Company continues to own a portfolio of proprietary disease-focused tests, which are currently available for licensing to the biopharma industry and diagnostic companies. The Company currently has a U.S. based diagnostic laboratory company offering its FHACT test domestically and a Chinese laboratory company preparing to offer its Tissue of Origin test in China. 
HPV-Associated Cancers
HPV-associated cancers, including cervical, anal, and head and neck cancers, are caused by infection with high-risk variants of human papillomavirus (HPV), and are responsible for approximately 4% of all cancer diagnoses worldwide. Cervical cancer is the third most common cancer among women. According to the National Institutes of Health, while there are more than 100 types of HPV, approximately 15 types are considered to be cancer-causing, with only 2 strains being responsible for 70% of cervical cancer cases worldwide. Cervical cancer may be detected by traditional methods, including Pap smears and liquid cytology, where cervical cells obtained by Pap smear are observed by a pathologist, or by HPV typing, which identifies the strain of HPV virus presently infecting the patient. Neither of these techniques is able to identify the likelihood of the HPV-infection’s developing into cancerous or precancerous lesions. According to the National Cancer Institute, about 50 million Pap smear tests to detect HPV are performed in the United States each year. It is estimated that approximately 2 million patients have abnormal Pap smear test results and are referred for biopsy/colposcopy as a result of such tests. However, only approximately 12,000 of these patients will develop cervical cancer. It is believed that early detection of HPV-associated cancers and lesions most likely to progress to cancer could eliminate unnecessary biopsies/colposcopies and thereby reduce health care costs.
The Company's Proprietary Tests for HPV-Associated Cancers

Test | Targeted Cancers | Technology & Advantages 
FHACT® | • HPV-Associated Cancers- Cervical Cancer- Anal Cancer- Head & Neck Cancers | • FHACT® is the Company's proprietary, 4-color FISH-based DNA probe designed to identify aberrations in four important chromosomal regions that have been implicated in cancers associated with infection by the human papilloma virus (HPV): cervical, anal and oropharyngeal.• FHACT® is designed to determine copy number changes of four particular genomic regions by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).

Solid Tissue Cancers
The term “solid tumors” encompasses abnormal masses of cells that do not include fluid areas (e.g. blood) or cysts. Solid tumors are composed of abnormal cell growths that originate in organs or soft tissue and are normally named after the types of cells that form them. Examples of solid tumors include breast cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer and melanoma. Solid tumors may be benign (not cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) and may spread from their primary tissue of origin to other locations in the body (metastasis). There are over 200 individual chemotherapeutic drugs available for combating solid tumor cancers. Selection of an appropriate course of treatment for a patient may depend on identification of the gene mutation or mutations present in their particular cancer and on determining the cancer’s tissue of origin. Metastatic tumors with an uncertain primary site can be a difficult clinical problem. In tens of thousands of oncology patients every year, no confident diagnosis is ever issued, making standard-of-care treatment impossible.
The Company's Proprietary Tests for Solid Tissue Cancers

Test | Targeted Cancers | Technology & Advantages 
Tissue of Origin® | • Solid Tissue Cancers- Thyroid- Breast- Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)- Gastric- Pancreas- Colorectal- Liver- Bladder- Kidney- Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma- Melanoma- Ovarian- Sarcoma- Testicular Germ Cell- Prostate | • Tissue of Origin® (TOO®) is FDA-cleared, Medicare-reimbursed, and provides extensive analytical and clinical validation for statistically significant improvement in accuracy over other methods.• TOO® is a gene expression test that is used to identify the origin in cancer cases that are metastatic and/or poorly differentiated and unable to be typed by traditional testing methods.• TOO® increases diagnostic accuracy and confidence in site-specific treatment decisions, and leads to a change in patient treatment based on results 65% of the time it is used.• TOO® assesses 2,000 genes, covering 15 of the most common tumor types and 90% of all solid tumors.• In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company acquired the TOO® test through its acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Response Genetics, Inc. 

Tissue of Origin® Test. The Company continues to own and maintain its FDA-cleared Tissue of Origin® test, or TOO®, a gene expression test that is indicated when there is clinical uncertainty about a poorly differentiated or undifferentiated, or a metastatic tumor where the primary tissue of cancer development is unknown. The Tissue of Origin® test the Company believes is currently the only FDA-cleared test of its kind on the market, and can determine the most likely tissue of origin of a patient tumor sample from the fifteen most common tumor types - including thyroid, breast, pancreas, colon, ovarian and prostate - which account for ninety percent of all incidences of solid tissue tumors, by measuring the expression levels of 2,000 individual genes. TOO® is supported by extensive analytical and clinical validation data from robust, multi-center clinical studies. The Company believes TOO® can reduce the need for repeated testing, examinations, imaging and biopsy procedures by providing clinicians with the primary tissue type with greater certainty than traditional diagnostic techniques. This in turn empowers physicians to select the correct type of treatment earlier in the course of the patient’s therapy.

Third-Party Suppliers
The Company currently relies on third-party suppliers for its specialized research and scientific instrumentation and related supplies of reagents, tumor cell lines, and other inventory for it to successfully perform its CRO services for its customers. In addition, the Company relies on contracted manufacturers and collaborative partners to produce materials necessary for its FHACT® and FDA-cleared Tissue of Origin® tests. The Company plans to continue to rely on these manufacturers and collaborative partners to manufacture these materials. The Company does not believe a short-term disruption from any one of these suppliers would have a material effect on its business, nor has the Company experienced any disruptions due to COVID-19.
Patents and Proprietary Technology
The Company has proprietary tests that enable oncologists and pathologists at hospitals, cancer centers, and physician offices to properly diagnose and inform cancer treatment. The Company relies on a combination of patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, as well as various contractual arrangements, in order to protect the proprietary aspects of its technology. The Company may also license its technology to others. The Company believes that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license is material to its business as a whole.
Until the Business Disposals, the Company's patent portfolio consisted of 20 issued U.S. patents, 5 pending U.S. applications, and more than 40 foreign patents. Most of this intellectual property was transferred to those parties the Company entered into to complete the Business Disposals. The Company's key remaining patents currently include:

• | Hematological cancers. The Company has two U.S. patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 8,580,713 and 8,557,747), directed to MatBA®, a microarray for detecting (and distinguishing) particular types of mature B cell neoplasms present in typical non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, Hodgkin’s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. These patents cover the Company's trademarked MatBA® microarray and are directed to both the microarray itself as well as associated methodologies designed to detect the particular type of mature B cell neoplasm present in a patient. The MatBA® microarray patents issued from the first of the Company's family of applications in the microarray space. The term of these patents runs through 2030.


• | The Company has four U.S. patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 8,977,506, 8,321,137, 7,747,547 and 8,473,217) covering its Tissue of Origin® Test. These patents are directed at systems and methods for detecting biological features in solid tumors. The term of these patents run through 2030.


• | HPV-Associated Cancers. The Company has three U.S. patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 9,157,129, 8,865,882 and 8,883,414) that cover methods for detecting HPV-associated cancers used in its FHACT® test. The term of these patents run through 2031.


• | FISH Probes. The Company has two patents covering its FISH probes. These patents cover probes and methodologies designed to detect and analyze particular chromosomal translocations (genetic lesions) associated with a wide range of cancers using a technique known as FISH and serve as the backbone for several of its other pending patent applications, which are more specifically geared towards other probes (and methodologies). The term of these patents run through 2022.

Until the Business Disposals, the Company held twenty-six U.S. registered trademarks, including a federal registration for the term “CGI” as well as three U.S. trademark applications and one foreign trademark registration for certain of its proprietary tests and services. The Company transferred the ownership of these trademarks to the Buyer, subject to a royalty-free license to use such intellectual property for six months after following the closing, and subject to its right to request an additional six months, which request has been made. The Company also owns the trademark for the vivoPharm trade name, which is the primary revenue-generating business unit.
Operations and Production Facilities
10

As a preclinical oncology contract research organization (CRO), the Company's leased facilities are built to house immunocompromised animals and specialized models. They incorporate surgical suites, gowning rooms, and holding rooms. In order to ensure an environment of utmost sterility, while also minimizing the workload by negating dependency on cage-wash infrastructure, the Company relies on its landlords and licensors to manage the vivarium’s at its animal facilities. This allows for more investment of time and energy into scientific endeavors. 
Third-Party Payor Reimbursement
Until the Business Disposals, the Company was reimbursed for clinical services by third-party payors that provided coverage to the patient, such as an insurance company, managed care organization or a governmental payor program or from physicians or other authorized parties (such as hospitals or independent laboratories) that ordered testing services or otherwise refer the services to the Company or directly from the patient.
Governmental Regulations
The Company's Pennsylvania and Australia research laboratory facilities comply with Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”) to the extent required by the FDA, Environmental Protection Agency, USDA, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), as well as other international regulatory agencies. Furthermore, the Company's early-stage discovery work, which is not subject to GLP standards, is typically carried out under a quality management system or internally developed quality systems. The Company's facilities are regularly inspected by U.S. and other regulatory compliance monitoring authorities, its clients' quality assurance departments, and its own internal quality assessment program. The Company is also accredited by AAALAC International, a private, nonprofit organization that promotes the humane treatment of animals in science through voluntary accreditation and assessment programs. The Company volunteers to participate in the AAALAC’s program to demonstrate its commitment to responsible animal care and use, in addition to its compliance with local, state and federal laws that regulate animal research.
FDA
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regulates the sale or distribution, in interstate commerce, of medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), including in vitro diagnostic test kits, reagents and instruments used to perform diagnostic testing. Certain of such devices must undergo premarket review by FDA prior to commercialization unless the device is of a type exempted from such review by statute or pursuant to FDA’s exercise of enforcement discretion. FDA, to date, has not exercised its authority to actively regulate the development and use of LDTs, such as the Company's, as medical devices and therefore the Company does not believe that its LDTs currently require premarket clearance or approval.
Post-market Regulation
The Company's Tissue of Origin® test obtained clearance under section 510(k) of the FDCA. After a device, such as its Tissue of Origin® test, is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply once the test is marketed, including FDA’s current good manufacturing practice requirements. Since the Company does not offer its FDA-approved product in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) the Company is not currently subject to post-market regulation in the EEA or any member state. The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that a company has failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:

• | warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;


• | recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of products;


• | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;


• | refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products;


• | reconsideration of 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;


• | refusal to grant export approvals for products; and/or


• | criminal prosecution.

In addition, FDA could publicly issue a safety notice related to the Company's test or request updates to its product labeling, including the addition of warnings, precautions, or contraindications.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH Act”)
Under the administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, the United States Department of Health and Human Services has issued regulations which establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic health care transactions and protecting the privacy and security of Protected Health Information used or disclosed by health care providers and other covered entities. For further discussion of HIPAA and the impact on the Company's business, see the section entitled “Risk Factors-Risks Related to its Business-The Company is required to comply with laws governing the transmission, security and privacy of health information that require significant compliance costs, and any failure to comply with these laws could result in material criminal and civil penalties.”
European General Data Protection Regulation
The collection and use of personal health data in the European Union had previously been governed by the provisions of the Data Protection Directive, which has been replaced by the General Data Protection Regulation (“GRPR”) which became effective on May 25, 2018 While the Data Protection Directive did not apply to organizations based outside the EU, the GDPR has expanded its reach to include any business, regardless of its location, that provides goods or services to residents in the EU. This expansion would incorporate the Company's clinical trial activities in EU members states. The GDPR imposes strict requirements on controllers and processors of personal data, including special protections for “sensitive information” which includes health and genetic information of data subjects residing in the EU. GDPR grants individuals the opportunity to object to the processing of their personal information, allows them to request deletion of personal information in certain circumstances, and provides the individual with an express right to seek legal remedies in the event the individual believes his or her rights have been violated. Further, the GDPR imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Union to the United States or other regions that have not been deemed to offer “adequate” privacy protections. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the European Union Member States, which may deviate slightly from the GDPR, may result in fines of up to 4% of global revenues, or € 20,000,000, whichever is greater. As a result of the implementation of the GDPR, the Company may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules.
The Company's research activities in the EU are currently limited to non-human preclinical studies, and as such, the Company does not collect, store, maintain, process, or transmit any Personal Data (as that term is defined under the GDPR) of trial subjects. However, since the Company currently has three employees located in the EU, its processing and transfer for employee Personal Data is subject to GDPR requirements. The Company has implemented a privacy and security program that is designed to adhere to the requirements of the GDPR in order to protect employee Personal Data, and in the event the Company progresses to research or clinical trials involving humans, to protect participant Personal Data. However, there is significant uncertainty related to the manner in which data protection authorities will seek to enforce compliance with GDPR. For example, it is not clear if the authorities will conduct random audits of companies doing business in the EU, or if the authorities will wait for complaints to be filed by individuals who claim their rights have been violated. Enforcement uncertainty and the costs associated with ensuring GDPR compliance be onerous and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. As a result, the Company cannot predict the impact of the GDPR regulations on its current or future business, either in the US or the EU. 
Federal, State and Foreign Fraud and Abuse Laws
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any health care item or service reimbursable under a governmental payor program. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including gifts, discounts, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of co-payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Recognizing that the Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the health care industry, the Department of Health and Human Services has issued a series of regulatory “safe harbors.” These safe harbor regulations set forth certain provisions, which, if met, will assure health care providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the federal Anti- Kickback Statute. Although full compliance with these provisions ensures against prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute will be pursued. For further discussion of the impact of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations on the Company's business, see the section entitled “Risk

Factors-Risks Related to its Business-The Company is subject to federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations and could face substantial penalties if the Company is unable to fully comply with such laws.”
In addition to the administrative simplification regulations discussed above, HIPAA also created two new federal crimes: health care fraud and false statements relating to health care matters. The health care fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from governmental payor programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from governmental payor programs.
Finally, another development affecting the health care industry is the increased enforcement of the federal False Claims Act and, in particular, actions brought pursuant to the False Claims Act’s “whistleblower” or “qui tam” provisions. The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal governmental payor program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government by submitting a false claim to the federal government and permit such individuals to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. In addition, various states have enacted false claim laws analogous to the federal False Claims Act, although many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not merely a governmental payor program. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties ranging from approximately $11 thousand to $22 thousand for each false claim violation that occurred after January 15, 2018. (Those whose false claims violations that occurred before January 15, 2018 could be liable for treble damages plus lower civil monetary penalties.)
Additionally, in Europe various countries have adopted anti-bribery laws providing for severe consequences, in the form of criminal penalties and/or significant fines, for individuals and/or companies committing a bribery offense. Violations of these anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on the Company's business, results of operations and reputation. For instance, in the United Kingdom, under the new Bribery Act 2010, which went into effect in July 2011, a bribery occurs when a person offers, gives or promises to give a financial or other advantage to induce or reward another individual to improperly perform certain functions or activities, including any function of a public nature. Bribery of foreign public officials also falls within the scope of the Bribery Act 2010. Under the new regime, an individual found in violation of the Bribery Act of 2010 faces imprisonment of up to 10 years. In addition, the individual can be subject to an unlimited fine, as can commercial organizations for failure to prevent bribery.
Corporate Practice of Medicine
Approximately thirty (30) states have enacted laws prohibiting business corporations, such as the Company, from practicing medicine and employing or engaging physicians to practice medicine, generally referred to as the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine. These laws, which vary among the states that have enacted them, are designed to prevent interference in the medical decision-making process by anyone who is not a licensed physician. Violation of these laws may result in civil or criminal fines, as well as sanctions imposed against the Company and/or the professional through licensure proceedings.
Other Regulatory Requirements
The Company's laboratory is subject to federal, state and local regulations relating to the handling and disposal of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and biohazardous waste, including chemical, biological agents and compounds, blood and bone marrow samples and other human tissue. Typically, the Company uses outside vendors who are contractually obligated to comply with applicable laws and regulations to dispose of such waste. These vendors are licensed or otherwise qualified to handle and dispose of such waste.
OSHA has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for health care employers, including requirements to develop and implement programs to protect workers from exposure to blood-borne pathogens by preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick or similar penetrating injuries.
Segment and Geographical Information
The Company operates in one reportable business segment and derive revenue from multiple countries, with 80% and 67% of its continuing operations revenue coming from the United States in fiscal year 2019 and 2018, respectively.
