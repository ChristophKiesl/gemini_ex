ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 Tidewater Inc., a Delaware corporation that is a listed company on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “TDW”, provides offshore service vessels and marine support services to the global offshore energy industry through the operation of a diversified fleet of marine service vessels. The company was incorporated in 1956 and conducts its operations through wholly-owned United States (U.S.) and international subsidiaries, as well as through joint ventures in which Tidewater has either majority or occasionally non-controlling interests (generally where required to satisfy local ownership or local content requirements). Unless otherwise required by the context, the term “company” as used herein refers to Tidewater Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
About Tidewater 
 The company’s vessels and associated vessel services provide support for all phases of offshore exploration, field development and production. These services include towing of, and anchor handling for, mobile offshore drilling units; transporting supplies and personnel necessary to sustain drilling, workover and production activities; offshore construction, remotely operated vehicle (ROV) operations, and seismic and subsea support; and a variety of specialized services such as pipe and cable laying. 
 
The company has one of the broadest geographic operating footprints in the offshore energy industry with operations in most of the world’s significant offshore crude oil and natural gas exploration and production offshore regions. Our global operating footprint allows us to react quickly to changing local market conditions and to be responsive to the changing requirements of the many customers with which we believe we have strong relationships. The company is also one of the most experienced international operators in the offshore energy industry with over 50 years of international experience. 
 
The company’s offshore support vessel fleet includes vessels that are operated under joint ventures, as well as vessels that have been stacked or withdrawn from service. At March 31, 2017, the company owned or chartered (under sale-leaseback agreements) 260 vessels (excluding eight joint venture vessels, but including 111 stacked vessels) and eight ROVs available to serve the global energy industry. Please refer to Note (1) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our stacked vessels. 
 Our revenues, net earnings and cash flows from operations are largely dependent upon the activity level of our offshore support vessel fleet. As is the case with other energy service companies, our business activity is largely dependent on the level of crude oil and natural gas and exploration, field development and production activity by our customers. Our customers’ business activity, in turn, is dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices, which fluctuate depending on expected future levels of supply and demand for crude oil and natural gas, and on estimates of the cost to find, develop and produce reserves. 
 Recent Developments
 The lower commodity prices from mid-2014, which persisted through 2017, resulted in reduced offshore exploration and development spending by our customers and reduced revenue and cash flows for the company, which compromised our ability to remain in compliance with certain financial covenants set forth in agreements governing our indebtedness. Prior to the end of fiscal 2016, and while the company was in compliance with its debt agreements, the company borrowed $600 million to provide adequate liquidity to weather the industry downturn. At March 31, 2017, we had $2.04 billion of debt ($2.03 billion, net of deferred debt issue costs of $6.4 million) consisting of (i) $900 million in borrowings under the Credit Agreement (as defined below), which consists of a fully drawn $600 million revolving credit facility and a $300 million term loan facility; (ii) $500 million in principal amount of 2013 Notes (as defined below); (iii) $165 million in principal amount of 2011 Notes (as defined below); (iv) $382.5 million in principal amount of 2010 Notes (as defined below); and (v) approximately $92 million of U.S. dollar-equivalent (“USD”) debt under the Troms Credit Agreement (as defined below), which consists of four tranches of unsecured debt.  For additional information, see “Indebtedness” under “Liquidity, Capital Resources and Other Matters in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In response to the significant and sustained decline in commodity prices and resulting decline in the (i) utilization of our offshore support vessels, (ii) average day rates received, and (iii) vessel revenue, in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, we focused on managing our balance sheet to preserve liquidity by taking certain steps, including reducing capital expenditures, terminating and/or renegotiating various contracts, and reducing our workforce and discretionary expenditures. We implemented a number of significant cost reduction measures to mitigate the effects of significantly lower vessel revenue and, given the currently challenging offshore support vessel market and business outlook, took other steps to improve our financial position and liquidity, including (i) the January 2016 suspension of our common stock dividend, (ii) the March 2016 $600 million draw on the Tidewater Credit Facility, and (iii) the renegotiation or termination of vessel construction contracts in order to reduce capital expenditures, which increased current and projected liquidity by in excess of $200 million.
 Despite efforts to reduce spending, we determined that with our current capital structure, we were not positioned to withstand the ongoing and precipitous decline in oil and gas prices and the corresponding decline in revenues and cash flows. We concluded that a reduction in our long-term debt and cash interest obligations was required to improve our financial position and flexibility. Additionally, we retained financial and legal advisors, to assist us in analyzing and considering financial, transactional and strategic alternatives. As such, we engaged Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP (“Weil”), as our restructuring counsel and Lazard Frères & Co. LLC (“Lazard”), as our investment banker and financial advisor, to assist us in developing and implementing a comprehensive restructuring plan. 
 At June 30, 2016, we failed to meet a 3.0x minimum interest coverage ratio covenant contained in the Credit Agreement, the Troms Credit Agreement, and the 2013 Notes Purchase Agreement (each as defined below) (collectively, the “Funded Debt Agreements”), which resulted in covenant noncompliance that would have allowed the respective lenders and/or the noteholders to declare us to be in default under each of the Funded Debt Agreements, and accelerate the indebtedness thereunder. In addition, our projected covenant non-compliance resulted in the inclusion in the report provided by our independent registered public accounting firm that accompanied our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 (the “Audit Opinion”) of an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Our inability to receive an Audit Opinion without modification was a separate event of default under the Credit Agreement that would have allowed the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness thereunder.
 To avoid an acceleration of indebtedness under the Funded Debt Agreements (and potentially the other Senior Unsecured Notes) we negotiated and obtained limited waivers from the necessary lenders and noteholders to extend the waiver of the audit opinion requirement and/or waive the minimum interest coverage ratio requirement until August 14, 2016 and subsequent, further extensions until September 18, 2016, October 21, 2016, November 11, 2016, January 27, 2017, March 3, 2017, and March 27, 2017.
 Since January 2016, we have been actively engaged in discussions and negotiations regarding restructuring alternatives with (i) a steering committee comprised of certain Tidewater Lenders (as defined below) (the “Bank Lender Steering Committee”), (ii) the Troms Lenders (as defined below), and (iii) an unofficial committee of certain unaffiliated holders of the 2013 Notes (the “Unofficial 2013 Noteholder Committee”). Since December 2016, such discussions and negotiations have focused on a restructuring through a consensual prepackaged plan pursuant to chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code that would be supported by a substantial percentage of our lenders and the noteholders. When the March 27, 2017 waiver expired on April 7, 2017 in accordance with its terms, our negotiations with the Bank Lender Steering Committee and the Unofficial Noteholder Committee regarding the terms of the restructuring were substantially complete. By early May, the Debtors (as defined below), the Bank Lender Steering Committee and the Unofficial Noteholder Committee reached an agreement in principle regarding the terms, and processes to document, the Restructuring embodied in the Prepackaged Plan through the RSA (as defined below). The RSA is an agreement pursuant to which the lenders agree to support the Prepackaged Plan. The Debtors were also able to reach an agreement in principle with the Troms Lenders regarding an amendment of the Troms Credit Agreement to be executed in conjunction with the Prepackaged Plan. 
 Restructuring Support Agreement. Prior to filing the Bankruptcy Petitions (as defined below), on May 11, 2017, the Debtors (as defined below) entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement (the “RSA”) with certain of its creditors (collectively, the “Consenting Creditors”), specifically: (i) lenders holding approximately 60% of the outstanding principal amount of the loans under the company’s Fourth Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of June 21, 2013 (the “Credit Agreement”), between the company as borrower, each of the guarantors named therein, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and the lenders party thereto (the “Consenting Tidewater Lenders”) and (ii) holders of approximately 99% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Tidewater’s (a) 3.90% Senior Notes, 2010-Series B due December 30, 2017, 3.95% Senior Notes, 2010-Series C due December 30, 2017, 4.12% Senior Notes, 2010-Series D due December 30, 2018, 4.17% Senior Notes, 2010-Series E due December 30, 2018, 4.33% Senior Notes,

2010-Series F due December 30, 2019, 4.51% Senior Notes, 2010-Series G due December 30, 2020, 4.56% Senior Notes, 2010-Series H due December 30, 2020, and 4.61% Senior Notes, 2010-Series I due December 30, 2022 (collectively, the “2010 Notes”), (b) 4.06% Senior Notes, Series 2011-A due March 31, 2019, 4.64% Senior Notes, Series 2011-B due June 30, 2021, and 4.54% Senior Notes, Series 2011-C due June 30, 2021 (collectively, the “2011 Notes”), and (c) 4.26% Senior Notes, Series 2013-A due November 16, 2020, 5.01% Senior Notes, Series 2013-B due November 15, 2023, and 5.16% Senior Notes, Series 2013-C due November 17, 2025 (collectively, the “2013 Notes,” and together with the 2010 Notes and the 2011 Notes, the “Notes”) (such holders, the “Consenting Noteholders”) to support a restructuring on the terms of the Prepackaged Plan. On May 12, 2017, the Debtors commenced the solicitation of votes on the Prepackaged Plan.
 Troms Forbearance Agreement and Amendment to the Troms Facility Agreement. As previously disclosed, on May 25, 2012, the Debtors, as guarantors, entered into a Term Loan Facility Agreement as amended and restated (the “Troms Facility Agreement”) with Troms Offshore Supply AS, as borrower (the “Troms Borrower”), Eksportkreditt Norge AS and Kommunal Landspensjonskasse Gjensidig Forsikringsselskap as lenders (the “Troms Lenders”), and certain bank guarantors party thereto (together with the Troms Lenders, the “Troms Finance Parties”). On May 11, 2017, the Debtors, the Troms Borrower, the Troms Finance Parties, the Additional Obligors (as defined herein) and Garantiinstituttet for Eksportkreditt and DNB Capital LLC as additional lenders (the “Additional Lenders”), entered into an Amendment and Restatement Agreement No. 4 (the “Fourth Amendment”), pursuant to which, among other things, (a) the Additional Lenders agreed to make available to the Troms Borrower a new term loan for up to $5,068,863, (b) Troms Offshore Fleet Holding AS, Troms Offshore Fleet 1 AS, Troms Offshore Fleet 2 AS, Troms Offshore Fleet 3 AS, Troms Offshore Fleet 4 AS, and JB Holding Company BV, each an indirect, wholly-owned foreign subsidiary of the company, agreed to serve as additional obligors of the obligations thereunder (collectively, the “Additional Obligors”), and (c) the Debtors, the Troms Borrower, the Additional Obligors, the Troms Finance Parties, and the Additional Lenders agreed to amend and restate the Troms Facility Agreement (the “Amended and Restated Troms Facility Agreement”). The Fourth Amendment will become effective on the Effective Date (as defined below).
 On May 11, 2017, the Debtors also entered into a Forbearance Agreement (the “Forbearance Agreement”) with the Troms Borrower, the Additional Lenders, DNB Bank ASA, New York Branch, as agent on behalf of the Troms Finance Parties, and the Norwegian Export Credit Guarantee Agency, as bank guarantor, which Forbearance Agreement relates to the Troms Facility Agreement. Pursuant to the Forbearance Agreement, among other provisions, the Troms Finance Parties have agreed that during the Forbearance Period (as defined below), subject to certain conditions precedent and continuing conditions, they will not enforce, or otherwise take any action to direct enforcement of, any of the rights and remedies available to the Finance Parties under the Troms Facility Agreement or otherwise, including, without limitation, any action to accelerate, or join in any request for acceleration of, the Troms Facility Agreement due to the company commencing voluntary cases under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code as contemplated by the RSA and the continued existence of certain specified events of default. The Forbearance Period began on May 11, 2017 and ends on the earliest of (i) August 30, 2017, (ii) the occurrence of any event of default under the Troms Facility Agreement, other than certain specified events of default, and (iii) the termination of the RSA as a result of the occurrence of any (a) Creditor Termination Event (as defined in the RSA), (b) Tidewater Termination Event (as defined in the RSA), or (c) other termination of the RSA under its terms.
 Reorganization and Chapter 11 Proceedings
 On May 17, 2017 (the “Petition Date”), the company and certain subsidiaries, Cajun Acquisitions, LLC, Gulf Fleet Supply Vessels, L.L.C., Hilliard Oil & Gas, Inc., Java Boat Corporation, Pan Marine International Dutch Holdings, L.L.C., Point Marine, L.L.C., Quality Shipyards, L.L.C., S.O.P., Inc., Tidewater Corporate Services, L.L.C., Tidewater GOM, Inc., Tidewater Marine, L.L.C., Tidewater Marine Alaska, Inc., Tidewater Marine Fleet, L.L.C., Tidewater Marine Hulls, L.L.C., Tidewater Marine International Dutch Holdings, L.L.C., Tidewater Marine Sakhalin, L.L.C., Tidewater Marine Ships, L.L.C., Tidewater Marine Vessels, L.L.C., Tidewater Marine Western, Inc., Tidewater Mexico Holding, L.L.C., Tidewater Subsea, L.L.C., Tidewater Subsea ROV, L.L.C., Tidewater Venture, Inc., Twenty Grand (Brazil), L.L.C., Twenty Grand Marine Service, L.L.C., and Zapata Gulf Marine L.L.C., (together with the company, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions for reorganization (the “Bankruptcy Petitions”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the "Bankruptcy Court") seeking relief under the provisions of chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the "Bankruptcy Code"). On May 19, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court set a combined hearing to consider approval of the Debtors’ disclosure statement and confirmation of the Prepackaged Plan for June 28, 2017. If the Prepackaged Plan is approved by the Bankruptcy Court within the time frame we currently expect, the Prepackaged Plan will likely become effective in July 2017, at which point or shortly thereafter the Debtors would emerge from bankruptcy, however, there can be no assurance that the effectiveness of the Prepackaged Plan will occur on such date, or at all.

As of the Petition Date, we had outstanding, unsecured prepetition funded debt obligations totaling approximately $2.04 billion. We also had certain obligations arising under the Sale Leaseback Agreements, pursuant to which the Debtors charter certain vessels owned by third parties.  Additionally, as of the Petition Date, we had $23.7 million of accrued interest payable on our Credit Facility and Notes.  With the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, all of the debt represented by the Credit Agreement, the Notes, and the Troms Facility Agreement accelerated, but the enforcement of the lenders and noteholders rights thereunder have been stayed by the bankruptcy proceeding.
 In connection with the restructuring contemplated by the Prepackaged Plan, the Debtors have identified certain cost savings opportunities, including the elimination of burdensome obligations under certain sale leaseback agreements (the “Sale Leaseback Agreements”), pursuant to which the Debtors charter certain vessels owned by third parties (the “Sale Leaseback Parties”).  On the Petition Date, the Debtors filed a motion seeking to reject such agreements (the rejection damage claims related thereto, the “Sale Leaseback Claims”).  Pursuant an order by the Bankruptcy Court approving a stipulation with the Sale Leaseback Parties, the Bankruptcy Court approved the rejection of the Sale Leaseback Agreements, the reserve for the Sale Leaseback Claims until they are resolved in the amount of approximately $324 million, and the temporary allowance of the disputed Sale Leaseback Claims for purposes of voting on the Prepackaged Plan.
 During the bankruptcy proceedings, the Debtors are operating as "debtors-in-possession" in accordance with applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. The Bankruptcy Court granted a number of first day motions filed by the Debtors, allowing the company to operate its business in the ordinary course throughout the bankruptcy process. The first day motions authorized, among other things, the company to pay prepetition employee wages and benefits without interruption, maintain its insurance programs, utilize its current cash management system, and pay undisputed prepetition obligations owed to its vendors and trade creditors in the ordinary course of business. Subject to certain exceptions under the Bankruptcy Code, the commencement of the Debtors’ chapter 11 cases automatically stayed most judicial or administrative actions against the Debtors and their property to, among other things, recover, or collect a pre-petition claim. 
 The Prepackaged Plan is subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and anticipates, among other things, that on the effective date of the Prepackaged Plan (the “Effective Date”): 
  
• | The lenders under the Credit Agreement, the holders of Notes, and the Sale Leaseback Parties (collectively, the “General Unsecured Creditors” and the claims thereof, the “General Unsecured Claims”) will receive their pro rata share of (a) $225 million of cash, (b) subject to the limitations discussed below, common stock and, if applicable, warrants (the “Jones Act Warrants”) to purchase common stock, representing 95% of the pro forma common equity in the reorganized company (subject to dilution by a management incentive plan and the exercise of warrants issued to existing stockholders under the Prepackaged Plan as described below); and (c) new 8% fixed rate secured notes due in 2022 in the aggregate principal amount of $350 million (the “New Secured Notes”).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The company’s existing shares of common stock will be cancelled as of the Effective Date. Existing common stockholders of the company will receive their pro rata share of common stock representing 5% of the pro forma common equity in the reorganized company (subject to dilution by a management incentive plan and the exercise of warrants issued to existing stockholders under the Prepackaged Plan) and six year warrants to purchase additional shares of common stock of the reorganized company. These warrants will be issued in two tranches, with the first tranche (the “Series A Warrants”) being exercisable immediately, at an aggregate exercise price based upon an equity value of the company of approximately $1.71 billion, and the second tranche (the “Series B Warrants”) being exercisable immediately, at an aggregate exercise price based upon an equity value of the company of $2.02 billion. The Series A Warrants will be exercisable for a number of shares equal to 7.5% of the sum of (i) the total outstanding shares of common stock after completion of the transactions contemplated by the Prepackaged Plan, and (ii) any shares issuable upon exercise of the Jones Act Warrants and the Series A Warrants, while the Series B Warrants will be exercisable for a number of shares equal to 7.5% of the sum of (x) the total outstanding shares of common stock after completion of the transactions contemplated by the Prepackaged Plan, and (y) any shares issuable upon the exercise of the Jones Act Warrants, the Series A Warrants, and Series B Warrants. Like the Jones Act Warrants, the Series A Warrants and the Series B Warrants will not grant the holder thereof any voting or control rights or dividend rights, or contain any negative covenants restricting the operation of the company’s business and will be subject to the restrictions in the company’s new certificate of incorporation described above that prohibit the exercise of such warrants where such exercise would cause the total number of shares held by non-U.S. citizens to exceed 24%.

• | To assure the continuing ability of certain vessels owned by the company’s subsidiaries to engage in U.S. coastwise trade, the number of shares of the company’s common stock that would otherwise be issuable to the allowed General Unsecured Creditors may be adjusted to assure that the foreign ownership limitations of the United States Jones Act are not exceeded. The Jones Act requires any corporation that engages in coastwise trade be a U.S. citizen within the meaning of that law, which requires, among other things, that the aggregate ownership of common stock by non-U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act be not more than 25% of its outstanding common stock. The Prepackaged Plan requires that, at the time the company emerges from bankruptcy, not more than 22% of the common stock will be held by non-U.S. citizens. To that end, the Prepackaged Plan provides for the issuance of a combination of common stock of the reorganized company and the Jones Act Warrants to purchase common stock of the reorganized company on a pro rata basis to any non-U.S. citizen among the allowed General Unsecured Creditors whose ownership of common stock, when combined with the shares to be issued to existing Tidewater stockholders that are non-U.S. citizens, would otherwise cause the 22% threshold to be exceeded. The Jones Act Warrants will not grant the holder thereof any voting or control rights or dividend rights, or contain any negative covenants restricting the operation of the company’s business. Generally, the Jones Act Warrants will be exercisable immediately at a nominal exercise price, subject to restrictions contained in the company’s new certificate of incorporation designed to assure the company’s continuing eligibility to engage in coastwise trade under the Jones Act that prohibit the exercise of such warrants where such exercise would cause the total number of shares held by non-U.S. citizens to exceed 24%. The company will establish, under its charter and through Depository Trust Corporation (DTC), appropriate measures to assure compliance with these ownership limitations.

• | The undisputed claims of other unsecured creditors such as customers, employees, and vendors, will be paid in full in the ordinary course of business (except as otherwise agreed among the parties).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The company and the Sale Leaseback Parties did not reach agreement with respect to the amount of the Sale Leaseback Claims. Accordingly, on the Effective Date, a portion of the above consideration in cash, Jones Act Warrants, and New Secured Notes in an amount that the company believes represents the maximum possible distributions owing on account of the Sale Leaseback Claims will be withheld from the cash, Jones Act Warrants, and New Secured Notes distributed to allowed General Unsecured Claims on account of such disputed Sale Leaseback Claims until they are resolved. To the extent the Sale Leaseback Claims are resolved for less than the amount withheld, the remainder will be distributed to holders of allowed General Unsecured Claims pro rata.
 Assuming implementation of the Prepackaged Plan, the company expects that it will eliminate approximately $1.6 billion in principal amount of outstanding debt. In addition, taking into account the rejection of the Sale-Leaseback Agreements discussed above, the company estimates that interest and operating lease expenses, collectively, will be reduced by approximately $73 million annually. Combined vessel operating lease expense and interest and debt costs, net was $108.8 million for fiscal year 2017.

Business Segments 
 
We manage and measure our business performance in four distinct operating segments that are based on the geographical location of our operations: Americas, Asia/Pacific, Middle East, and Africa/Europe. At the beginning of fiscal year 2017, our operations in the Mediterranean Sea (based in Egypt) were transitioned from the previously disclosed Middle East/North Africa operations and included with the previously disclosed Sub-Saharan Africa/Europe operations as a result of management realignment. As such, we now disclose these new segments as Middle East and Africa/Europe, respectively. Our Americas and Asia/Pacific segments were not affected by this change. This new segment alignment is consistent with our chief operating decision maker’s review of operating results for the purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. Our Americas segment includes the activities of our North American operations, which include operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (GOM) and U.S. and Canadian coastal waters of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, as well as operations offshore Mexico, Trinidad and Brazil. The Asia/Pacific segment includes our Australian and Southeast Asian and Western Pacific operations. Our Middle East segment includes our operations in the Arabian Gulf and offshore India. Lastly, our Africa/Europe segment includes operations conducted along the East and West Coasts of Africa as well as operations in and around the Caspian Sea, the Mediterranean and Red Seas, the Black Sea, the North Sea and certain other arctic/cold water markets. 
 Our principal customers in each of these business segments are large, international oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production companies (IOCs); select independent exploration and production (E&P) companies; foreign government-owned or government-controlled organizations and other related companies that explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas (NOCs); drilling contractors; and other companies that provide various services to the offshore energy industry, including but not limited to, offshore construction companies, diving companies and well stimulation companies. 
 The company’s vessels are dispersed throughout the major offshore crude oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production areas of the world. Although the company considers, among other things, mobilization costs and the availability of suitable vessels in its fleet deployment decisions, and cabotage rules in certain countries occasionally restrict the ability of the company to move vessels between markets, the company’s diverse, mobile asset base and the wide geographic distribution of its vessels generally enable the company to respond relatively quickly to changing market conditions and customer requirements. 
 Revenues in each of our segments are derived primarily from vessel time charter or similar contracts that are generally from three months to four years in duration as determined by customer requirements, and, to a lesser extent, from vessel time charter contracts on a “spot” basis, which is a short-term (one day to three months) agreement to provide offshore marine services to a customer for a specific short-term job. The base rate of hire for a term contract is generally a fixed rate, though some charter arrangements allow the company to recover specific additional costs. 
 
In each of our segments, and depending on vessel capabilities and availability, our vessels operate in the shallow, intermediate and deepwater offshore markets. The deepwater offshore market has been an increasingly important sector of the offshore crude oil and natural gas markets due to technological developments that have made deepwater exploration and development feasible and, if the commodity pricing environment improves, deepwater exploration and development could return to being a source of potential long-term growth for the company. Deepwater oil and gas development typically involves significant capital investment and multi-year development plans. Such projects are generally underwritten by the participating exploration, field development and production companies using relatively conservative crude oil and natural gas pricing assumptions. Although these projects are generally less susceptible to short-term fluctuations in the price of crude oil and natural gas, deepwater exploration and development projects can be costly relative to other onshore and offshore exploration and development. As a result, the sustained low levels of crude oil prices has caused, and may continue to cause, many E&P companies to restrain their level of capital expenditures in regards to deepwater projects. 
 As of March 31, 2017, there were approximately 50 deepwater offshore rigs under construction; however, there is uncertainty as to how many of those rigs, most of which are expected to enter service within the next two years, will increase the offshore working rig fleet (which was approximately 420 rigs at March 31, 2017, down approximately 80 rigs over the past 12 months) and how many of those rigs will replace older, less productive drilling units or be unable to secure work at all. The dayrates and the overall utilization of the worldwide deepwater offshore supply vessel fleet, which is also expected to increase in size, will, at least in part, depend upon whether there is an overall net growth in the number of working deepwater rigs.

Please refer to Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note (15) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further disclosure of segment revenues, operating profits, and total assets by geographical areas in which the company operates. 
 Our Global Vessel Fleet and Vessel Construction, Acquisition and Replacement Program
 Since fiscal 2000, the company has been engaged in a vessel construction, acquisition and replacement program, with the intent of being able to operate in nearly all major oil and gas producing regions of the world by replacing older vessels in the company’s fleet with larger, more technologically sophisticated vessels. During that period, the company purchased and/or constructed 290 vessels at a total cost of approximately $5 billion (including 41 vessels at a cost of $331.1 million that were subsequently sold in transactions other than sale/lease transactions). To date, the company has generally funded its vessel programs from its operating cash flows, together with funds provided by four private debt placements of senior unsecured notes and borrowings under bank credit facilities, proceeds from the disposition of (generally older) vessels, and various vessel sale-leaseback arrangements. 
 The company operates the largest number of new offshore support vessels among its competitors in the industry. The company will continue to carefully consider whether future proposed investments and transactions have the appropriate risk/return-on-investment profile. 
 The average age of the company’s 260 owned or chartered vessels (excluding joint-venture vessels) at March 31, 2017 is approximately 9.8 years. Of the company’s 260 vessels, 104 are deepwater platform supply vessels (PSVs) or deepwater anchor handling towing supply (AHTS) vessels, and 109 vessels are non-deepwater towing-supply vessels, which include both smaller PSVs and smaller AHTS vessels that primarily serve the jackup drilling market. Included within our “other” vessel class are 47 vessels which are primarily crew boats and offshore tugs. 
 
At March 31, 2017, the company had commitments to build two vessels at two different shipyards at a total cost, including contract costs and other incidental costs, of approximately $110 million. At March 31, 2017, the company had invested approximately $77 million in progress payments towards the construction of the two vessels, and the remaining expenditures necessary to complete construction was estimated at $33 million. The two vessels under construction at March 31, 2017 are deepwater PSVs, between approximately 5,150 and 5,900 deadweight tons of cargo carrying capacity. In April 2017, the company was paid $5.3 million in connection with a novation agreement, pursuant to which the company assigned its construction contract for the one internationally built vessel to a third party thus relieving the company of future payments of $27.2 million related to this vessel. Remaining commitments are $5.8 million after giving effect to the novation agreement.
 The company disposed of 725 vessels during the fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2017 period. Most of the vessels were sold at prices that exceeded such vessels’ carrying values at the time of disposition by the company. In the aggregate, proceeds from, and pre-tax gains on, vessel dispositions during this period approximated $800 million and $330 million, respectively. 
 Further discussions of our vessel construction, acquisition and replacement program, including the various settlement agreements with certain international shipyards related to the construction of vessels and our capital commitments, scheduled delivery dates and recent vessel sales are disclosed in the “Vessel Count, Dispositions, Acquisitions and Construction Programs” section of Item 7 and Note (12) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 The “Vessel Count, Dispositions, Acquisitions and Construction Programs” section of Item 7 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains a table comparing the actual March 31, 2017 vessel count and the average number of vessels by class and geographic distribution during the three years ended March 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. 
 Our Vessel Classifications 
 Our vessels routinely move from one geographic region and reporting segment to another, and from one operating area to another operating area within the geographic regions and reporting segments. We disclose our vessel statistical information, including revenue, utilization and average day rates, by vessel class. Listed below are our three major vessel classes along with a description of the type of vessels categorized in each vessel class and the services the respective vessels typically perform. Tables comparing the average size of the company’s vessel fleet by class and geographic distribution for the last three fiscal years are included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Deepwater Vessels 
 Deepwater vessels, in the aggregate, are currently the company’s largest contributor to consolidated vessel revenue and vessel operating margin. Included in this vessel class are large PSVs (typically greater than 230-feet and/or with greater than 2,800 tons in dead weight cargo carrying capacity) and large, higher-horsepower AHTS vessels (generally greater than 10,000 horsepower). These vessels are generally chartered to customers for use in transporting supplies and equipment from shore bases to deepwater and intermediate water depth offshore drilling rigs and production platforms and for otherwise supporting intermediate and deepwater drilling, production, construction and maintenance operations. Deepwater PSVs generally have large cargo carrying capacities, both below deck (liquid mud tanks and dry bulk tanks) and above deck. Deepwater AHTS vessels are equipped to tow drilling rigs and other marine equipment, as well as to set anchors for the positioning and mooring of drilling rigs that generally do not have dynamic positioning capabilities. Many of our deepwater PSVs and AHTS vessels are outfitted with dynamic positioning capabilities, which allow the vessel to maintain an absolute or relative position when mooring to an offshore installation, rig or another vessel is deemed unsafe, impractical or undesirable. Many of our deepwater vessels also have oil recovery, firefighting, standby rescue and/or other specialized equipment. Our customers have high standards in regards to safety and other operational competencies and capabilities, in part to meet the more stringent regulatory standards, especially in the wake of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon incident. 
 Our deepwater class of vessel also includes specialty vessels that can support offshore well stimulation, construction work, subsea services and/or serve as remote accommodation facilities. These vessels are generally available for routine supply and towing services, but these vessels are also outfitted, and primarily intended, for specialty services. For example, these vessels can be equipped with a variety of lifting and deployment systems, including large capacity cranes, winches or reel systems. Included in the specialty vessel category is the company’s one multi-purpose platform supply vessel (MPSV). Our MPSV is approximately 311 feet in length, has a 100-ton active heave compensating crane, a moonpool and a helideck and is designed for subsea service and light construction support activities. This vessel is significantly larger in size, more versatile, and more specialized than the PSVs discussed above. The MPSV typically commands a higher day rate because the vessel has more capabilities, and because the vessel has a higher construction cost and higher operating costs. 
 Towing-Supply Vessels 
 This is currently the company’s largest fleet class by number of vessels. Included in this class are non-deepwater AHTS vessels with horsepower below 10,000 BHP, and non-deepwater PSVs that are generally less than 230 feet. The vessels in this class perform the same respective functions and services as deepwater AHTS vessels and deepwater PSVs except towing-supply vessels are generally chartered to customers for use in intermediate and shallow waters. 
 Other Vessels 
 The company’s “Other” vessels include crew boats, utility vessels and offshore tugs. Crew boats and utility vessels are chartered to customers for use in transporting personnel and supplies from shore bases to offshore drilling rigs, platforms and other installations. These vessels are also often equipped for oil field security missions in markets where piracy, kidnapping or other potential violence presents a concern. Offshore tugs are used to tow floating drilling rigs and barges; to assist in the docking of tankers; and to assist pipe laying, cable laying and construction barges. 
Revenue Contribution by Major Classes of Vessels 
 Revenues from vessel operations were derived from the following classes of vessels in the following percentages: 
 
 
 | Year Ended March 31, | 
--------------+----------------------+-----
 | 2017 | | | 2016 | | 2015
Deepwater | | 53.0 | % | | 55.0 | % | 58.4 | %
Towing-supply | | 40.8 | % | | 38.0 | % | 34.5 | %
Other | | 6.2 | % | | 7.0 | % | 7.1 | %

Subsea Services 
 Historically, the company’s subsea services were composed primarily of seismic and subsea vessel support. During fiscal 2014 the company expanded its subsea services capabilities by hiring a dedicated group of employees with substantial ROV and subsea expertise and by purchasing six work-class ROVs. Two additional higher specification work-class ROVs were added to the company’s fleet in fiscal 2015. Each ROV is capable of being deployed and redeployed worldwide on a variety of vessels and platforms, and we began ROV deployment and operations in fiscal 2015. Our expanded subsea services capabilities include services and engineering solutions in all phases of the life of a subsea well, including exploration, construction and installation, and maintenance, repair and inspection. Our equipment and subsea professionals can support subsea operations in water depths of up to 13,000 feet. In connection with the purchase of ROVs, the company has developed a proprietary operations management system customized for the operation of ROVs. While we are generally curtailing additional investment in subsea services and other growth initiatives given reduced offshore activity levels, further expansion of our subsea services business, if undertaken, may include organic growth through commissioning the construction of additional ROVs or acquisitions of recently built ROVs and/or other ROV owners and operators. 
Customers and Contracting 
 The company’s operations are dependent upon the levels of activity in offshore crude oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production throughout the world, which is affected by trends in global crude oil and natural gas pricing, including expectations of future commodity pricing, which is ultimately influenced by the supply and demand relationship for these natural resources. The activity levels of our customers are also influenced by the cost of exploring for and producing crude oil and natural gas, which can be affected by environmental regulations, technological advances that affect energy production and consumption, significant weather conditions, the ability of our customers to raise capital, and local and international economic and political environments, including government mandated moratoriums. 
 
The recent trend in crude oil prices and the current pricing outlook could lead to increased exploration, development and production activity as current prices for WTI and ICE Brent are approaching the range which some surveys have indicated that, if sustainable, E&P companies would begin to increase spending. However, a recovery in onshore exploration, development and production activity and spending, and in North American onshore activity and spending in particular, has already begun and is expected to continue to precede a recovery in offshore activity and spending, much of which takes place in the international markets. These same analysts also expect that a further decrease in offshore spending is likely during calendar year 2017 and that any improvements in offshore E&P activity would likely not occur until calendar year 2018, the timing of which is generally consistent with the trend of the projected global working offshore rig count according to recent IHS-Petrodata reports. A discussion of current market conditions and trends appears under “Macroeconomic Environment and Outlook” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 The company’s principal customers are IOCs; select independent E&P companies; NOCs; drilling contractors; and other companies that provide various services to the offshore energy industry, including but not limited to, offshore construction companies, diving companies and well stimulation companies. 
 Our primary source of revenue is derived from time charter contracts on our vessels on a rate per day of service basis; therefore, vessel revenues are recognized on a daily basis throughout the contract period. As noted above, these time charter contracts are generally either on a term or “spot” basis. There are no material differences in the cost structure of the company’s contracts based on whether the contracts are spot or term because the operating costs for an active vessel are generally the same without regard to the length of a contract.

The following table discloses our customers that accounted for 10% or more of total revenues during any of our last three fiscal years: 
 
 
 | 2017 | | | 2016 | | 2015
-------------------------+------+------+---+------+------+-----
Chevron Corporation (A) | | 16.3 | % | | 14.6 | % | 12.7 | %
Freeport McMoRan (B) | | 11.3 | % | | 3.5 | % | 1.6 | %
Saudi Aramco | | 10.0 | % | | 7.6 | % | 5.4 | %
Petroleo Brasileiro SA | | 8.2 | % | | 11.0 | % | 11.8 | %
BP plc | | 5.8 | % | | 7.1 | % | 10.1 | %


(A) | 78%, 73% and 78% percent of revenue generated by Chevron in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively relates to activity in Angola. Please refer to Sonatide Joint Venture disclosure below 
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(B) | A significant portion of this customer’s fiscal 2017 revenue was the result of the early termination of a long-term vessel charter contract.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
While it is normal for our customer base to change over time as our vessel time charter contracts turn over, the unexpected loss of any of these significant customers could, at least in the short term, have a material adverse effect on the company’s vessel utilization and its results of operations. Our five largest customers in aggregate accounted for approximately 53% of our fiscal 2017 total revenues, while the ten largest customers in aggregate accounted for approximately 75% of the company’s fiscal 2017 total revenues. 
 Competition 
 The principal competitive factors for the offshore vessel service industry are the suitability and availability of vessels and related equipment, price and quality of service. In addition, the ability to demonstrate a strong safety record and attract and retain qualified and skilled personnel are also important competitive factors. The company has numerous competitors in all areas in which it operates around the world, and the business environment in all of these markets is highly competitive. 
 
The company’s diverse, mobile asset base and the wide geographic distribution of its assets generally enable the company to respond relatively quickly to changes in market conditions and to provide a broad range of vessel services to its customers around the world. We believe that size, age, diversity and geographic distribution of a vessel operator’s fleet, economies of scale and experience level in the many areas of the world are competitive advantages in our industry.
 
Increases in worldwide vessel capacity generally have the effect of lowering charter rates, particularly when there are lower levels of exploration, field development and production activity as has been the case since late calendar 2014 when oil prices began to trend lower. 
 
According to IHS-Petrodata, the global offshore support vessel market had approximately 335 new-build offshore support vessels (deepwater PSVs, deepwater AHTS vessels and towing-supply vessels only) either under construction (290 vessels), or on order as of March 2017. The vessels under construction are scheduled to be delivered into the worldwide offshore vessel market primarily over the next 12 months. The current worldwide fleet of these classes of vessels is estimated at approximately 3,510 vessels, of which we estimate that a significant portion are stacked or are not being actively marketed by the vessels’ owners. The worldwide offshore marine vessel industry, however, also has a large number of aged vessels, including approximately 620 vessels, or 18%, of the worldwide offshore fleet, that are at least 25 years old and nearing or exceeding original expectations of their estimated economic lives. These older vessels, of which we estimate the majority are already stacked or not actively marketed by the vessels’ owners, could potentially be removed from the market in the near future if the cost of extending the vessels’ lives is not economical, especially in light of recent market conditions. 
 
Excluding the 620 vessels that are at least 25 years old from the overall population, the company estimates that the number of offshore support vessels under construction (290 vessels) represents approximately 10% of the remaining worldwide fleet of approximately 2,890 offshore support vessels.
 
Although the future attrition rate of the older offshore support vessels cannot be determined with certainty, the company believes that the retirement and/or sale to owners outside of the oil and gas market of a vast majority of these aged vessels (a majority of which the company believes have already been stacked or are not being actively marketed to oil and gas development-focused customers by the vessels’ owners) could mitigate the potential negative effects on vessel utilization 
 14


and vessel pricing of (i) additional offshore support vessel supply resulting from the delivery of additional new-build vessels and (ii) reduced demand for offshore support vessels resulting from reduced offshore spending by E&P companies. Similarly, the cancellation or deferral of delivery of some portion of the 290 offshore support vessels that are under construction according to IHS-Petrodata would also mitigate the potential negative effects on vessel utilization and vessel pricing of reduced demand for offshore support vessels resulting from reduced offshore spending by E&P companies. 
 
In addition, we and other offshore support vessel owners have selectively stacked more recently constructed vessels as a result of the significant reduction in our customers’ offshore oil and gas-related activity and the resulting more challenging offshore support vessel market that has existed since late calendar 2014. Should market conditions continue to remain depressed, the stacking or underutilization of recently constructed vessels by the offshore supply vessel industry will likely continue. 
 Challenges We Confront as an International Offshore Vessel Company 
 
We operate in many challenging operating environments around the world that present varying degrees of political, social, economic and other uncertainties. We operate in markets where risks of expropriation, confiscation or nationalization of our vessels or other assets, terrorism, piracy, civil unrest, changing foreign currency exchange rates, and changing political conditions may adversely affect our operations. Although the company takes what it believes to be prudent measures to safeguard its property, personnel and financial condition against these risks, it cannot eliminate entirely the foregoing risks, though the wide geographic dispersal of the company’s vessels helps reduce the overall potential impact of these risks. 
 
In addition, immigration, customs, tax and other regulations (and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof) can have a material impact on our ability to work in certain countries and on our operating costs. 
 In some international operating environments, local customs or laws may require or make it advisable that the company form joint ventures with local owners or use local agents. The company is dedicated to carrying out its international operations in compliance with the rules and regulations of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the Trading with the Enemy Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and other applicable laws and regulations. The company has adopted policies and procedures to mitigate the risks of violating these rules and regulations. 
 
Sonatide Joint Venture 
 
The company has previously disclosed the significant financial and operational challenges that it confronts with respect to its substantial operations in Angola, as well as steps that the company has taken to address or mitigate those risks. Most of the company’s attention has been focused  in three areas: reducing the net receivable balance due the company from Sonatide, its Angolan joint venture with Sonangol, for vessel services; reducing the foreign currency risk created by virtue of provisions of Angolan law that require that payment for a significant  portion of the services provided by Sonatide be paid in Angolan kwanza; and optimizing opportunities, consistent with Angolan law,  for services provided by the company be paid for directly in U.S. dollars. These challenges, and the company’s efforts to respond, continue. 
 
Amounts due from Sonatide (Due from affiliate in the consolidated balance sheets) at March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016 of approximately $263 million and $339 million, respectively, represent cash received by Sonatide from customers and due to the company, amounts due from customers that are expected to be remitted to the company through Sonatide and costs incurred by the company on behalf of Sonatide. Approximately $56 million of the balance at March 31, 2017 represents invoiced but unpaid vessel revenue related to services performed by the company through the Sonatide joint venture. Remaining amounts due to the company from Sonatide are, in part, supported by (i) approximately $90 million of cash (primarily denominated in Angolan kwanzas) held by Sonatide that is pending conversion into U.S. dollars and the subsequent expatriation of such funds and (ii) approximately $133 million of amounts due from the company to Sonatide, including $34.7 million in commissions payable by the company to Sonatide with the balance related to costs incurred by Sonatide on behalf of the company.
 
15


For the year ended March 31, 2017, the company collected (primarily through Sonatide) approximately $114 million from its Angolan operations. Of the $114 million collected, approximately $101 million were U.S. dollars received by Sonatide on behalf of the company or U.S. dollars received directly by the company from customers. The balance of $13 million collected reflects Sonatide’s conversion of Angolan kwanza into U.S. dollars and the subsequent expatriation of the dollars and payment to the company. The company also reduced the net due from affiliate and due to affiliate balances by approximately $88 million during the year ended March 31, 2017 through netting transactions based on an agreement with the joint venture.
 Amounts due to Sonatide (Due to affiliate in the consolidated balance sheets) at March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016 of approximately $133 million and $188 million, respectively, represents amounts due to Sonatide for commissions payable and other costs paid by Sonatide on behalf of the company. 
 
The company believes that the process for converting Angolan kwanzas continues to function, but is challenged because of the tight U.S. dollar liquidity situation that continues in Angola. Sonatide continues to press the commercial banks with which it has relationships to increase the amount of U.S. dollars that are made available to Sonatide.
 
For the year ended March 31, 2017, the company’s Angolan operations generated vessel revenues of approximately $127 million, or 22%, of its consolidated vessel revenue, from an average of approximately 58 company-owned vessels that are marketed through the Sonatide joint venture (20 of which were stacked on average during the year ended March 31, 2017), and, for the year ended March 31, 2016, generated vessel revenues of approximately $213 million, or 22%, of consolidated vessel revenue, from an average of approximately 65 company-owned vessels (eight of which were stacked on average during the year ended March 31, 2016).
 
Sonatide owns seven vessels (three of which are currently stacked) and certain other assets, in addition to earning commission income from company-owned vessels marketed through the Sonatide joint venture (owned 49% by the company). As of March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, the carrying value of the company’s investment in the Sonatide joint venture, which is included in ”Investments in, at equity, and advances to unconsolidated companies,” was approximately $45 million and $37 million, respectively. 
 
Management continues to explore ways to profitably participate in the Angolan market while looking for opportunities to reduce the overall level of exposure to the increased risks that the company believes currently characterize the Angolan market. Included among mitigating measures taken by the company to address these risks is the redeployment of vessels from time to time to other markets. Redeployment of vessels to and from Angola during the year ended March 31, 2017 and year ended March 31, 2016 has resulted in a net 22 and 23 vessels transferred out of Angola, respectively.  
 International Labour Organization’s Maritime Labour Convention 
 
The International Labour Organization's Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 (the "Convention") mandates globally, among other things, seafarer living and working conditions (accommodations, wages, conditions of employment, health and other benefits) aboard ships that are engaged in commercial activities.  Since its initial entry into force on August 20, 2013, 81 countries have now ratified the Convention.
 
The company continues to prioritize certification of its vessels to Convention requirements based on the dates of enforcement by countries in which the company has operations, performs maintenance and repairs at shipyards, or may make port calls during ocean voyages. Once obtained, vessel certifications are maintained, regardless of the area of operation. Additionally, where possible, the company continues to work with its operationally identified flag states to seek substantial equivalencies to comparable national and industry laws that meet the intent of the Convention and allow the company to standardize operational protocols among its fleet of vessels that work in various areas around the world.
 Government Regulation 
 The company is subject to various United States federal, state and local statutes and regulations governing the operation and maintenance of its vessels. The company’s U.S. flagged vessels are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States Coast Guard, the United States Customs and Border Protection, and the United States Maritime Administration. The company is also subject to international laws and conventions and the laws of international jurisdictions where the company and its offshore vessels operate. 
 Under the citizenship provisions of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 and the Shipping Act, 1916, as amended, the company would not be permitted to engage in the U.S. coastwise trade if more than 25% of the company’s outstanding 
 16


stock were owned by non-U.S. citizens. For a company engaged in the U.S. coastwise trade to be deemed a U.S. citizen: (i) the company must be organized under the laws of the United States or of a state, territory or possession thereof, (ii) each of the chief executive officer and the chairman of the board of directors of such corporation must be a U.S. citizen, (iii) no more than a minority of the number of directors of such corporation necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business can be non-U.S. citizens and (iv) at least 75% of the interest in such company must be owned by U.S. citizens. The company has a dual stock certificate system to protect against non-U.S. citizens owning more than 25% of its common stock. In addition, the company’s charter provides the company with certain remedies with respect to any transfer or purported transfer of shares of the company’s common stock that would result in the ownership by non-U.S. citizens of more than 24% of its common stock. Based on information supplied to the company by its transfer agent, approximately 8% of the company’s outstanding common stock was owned by non-U.S. citizens as of March 31, 2017. 
 
The company’s vessel operations in the U.S. GOM are considered to be coastwise trade. United States law requires that vessels engaged in the U.S. coastwise trade must be built in the U.S. and registered under U.S flag. In addition, once a U.S. built vessel is registered under a non-U.S. flag, it cannot thereafter engage in U.S. coastwise trade. Therefore, the company’s non-U.S. flagged vessels must operate outside of the U.S. coastwise trade zone. Of the total 260 vessels owned or operated by the company at March 31, 2017, 236 vessels were registered under flags other than the United States and 24 vessels were registered under the U.S. flag. 
 All of the company’s offshore vessels are subject to either United States or international safety and classification standards or sometimes both. U.S. flag deepwater PSVs, deepwater AHTS vessels, towing-supply vessels, and crewboats are required to undergo periodic inspections twice within every five year period pursuant to U.S. Coast Guard regulations. Vessels registered under flags other than the United States are subject to similar regulations and are governed by the laws of the applicable international jurisdictions and the rules and requirements of various classification societies, such as the American Bureau of Shipping. 
 The company is in compliance with the International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code, an amendment to the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention (1974/1988), and further mandated in the Maritime Transportation and Security Act of 2002 to align United States regulations with those of SOLAS and the ISPS Code. Under the ISPS Code, the company performs worldwide security assessments, risk analyses, and develops vessel and required port facility security plans to enhance safe and secure vessel and facility operations. Additionally, the company has developed security annexes for those U.S. flag vessels that transit or work in waters designated as high risk by the United States Coast Guard pursuant to the latest revision of Marsec Directive 104-6. 
 Environmental Compliance 
 During the ordinary course of business, the company’s operations are subject to a wide variety of environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of oil and pollutants into navigable waters. Violations of these laws may result in civil and criminal penalties, fines, injunctions and other sanctions. Compliance with the existing governmental regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has not had, nor is expected to have, a material effect on the company. Environmental laws and regulations are subject to change, however, and may impose increasingly strict requirements, and, as such, the company cannot estimate the ultimate cost of complying with such potential changes to environmental laws and regulations. 
 The company is also involved in various legal proceedings that relate to asbestos and other environmental matters. The amount of ultimate liability, if any, with respect to these proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The company is proactive in establishing policies and operating procedures for safeguarding the environment against any hazardous materials aboard its vessels and at shore-based locations. 
 Whenever possible, hazardous materials are maintained or transferred in confined areas in an attempt to ensure containment, if accidents were to occur. In addition, the company has established operating policies that are intended to increase awareness of actions that may harm the environment.

Safety 
 We are dedicated to ensuring the safety of our operations for our employees, our customers and any personnel associated with our operations. Tidewater’s principal operations occur in offshore waters where the workplace environment presents many safety challenges. Management communicates frequently with company personnel to promote safety and instill safe work habits through the use of company media directed at, and regular training of, both our seamen and shore-based personnel. Personnel and resources are dedicated to ensure safe operations and regulatory compliance. Our Director of Health, Safety, Environment and Security (HSES) Management is involved in numerous proactive efforts to prevent accidents and injuries from occurring. The HSES Director also reviews all incidents that occur throughout the company, focusing on lessons that can be learned from such incidents and opportunities to incorporate such lessons into the company’s on-going safety-related training. In addition, the company employs safety personnel in every operating region to be responsible for administering the company’s safety programs and fostering the company’s safety culture. The company’s position is that each of its employees is a safety supervisor, who has the authority and the obligation to stop any operation that they deem to be unsafe. 
Risk Management 
 The operation of any marine vessel involves an inherent risk of marine losses (including physical damage to the vessel) attributable to adverse sea and weather conditions, mechanical failure, and collisions. In addition, the nature of our operations exposes the company to the potential risks of damage to and loss of drilling rigs and production facilities, hostile activities attributable to war, sabotage, piracy and terrorism, as well as business interruption due to political action or inaction, including nationalization of assets by foreign governments. Any such event may lead to a reduction in revenues or increased costs. The company’s vessels are generally insured for their estimated market value against damage or loss, including war, acts of terrorism, and pollution risks, but the company does not directly or fully insure for business interruption. The company also carries workers’ compensation, maritime employer’s liability, director and officer liability, general liability (including third party pollution) and other insurance customary in the industry. 
 The company seeks to secure appropriate insurance coverage at competitive rates, in part, by maintaining self-insurance up to certain individual and aggregate loss limits. The company carefully monitors claims and participates actively in claims estimates and adjustments. Estimated costs of self-insured claims, which include estimates for incurred but unreported claims, are accrued as liabilities on our balance sheet. 
 The continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility have significantly increased the risk of political, economic and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which the company operates. It is possible that further acts of terrorism may be directed against the United States domestically or abroad, and such acts of terrorism could be directed against properties and personnel of U.S. headquartered companies such as ours. The resulting economic, political and social uncertainties, including the potential for future terrorist acts and war, could cause the premiums charged for the insurance coverage to increase. The company currently maintains war risk coverage on its entire fleet. 
 Management believes that the company’s insurance coverage is adequate. The company has not experienced a loss in excess of insurance policy limits; however, there is no assurance that the company’s liability coverage will be adequate to cover potential claims that may arise. While the company believes that it should be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates considered commercially acceptable, it cannot guarantee that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially acceptable rates given the markets in which the company operates. 
 Seasonality 
 The company’s global vessel fleet generally has its highest utilization rates in the warmer months when the weather is more favorable for offshore exploration, field development and construction work. Hurricanes, cyclones, the monsoon season, and other severe weather can negatively or positively impact vessel operations. In particular, the company’s U.S. GOM operations can be impacted by the Atlantic hurricane season from the months of June through November, when offshore exploration, field development and construction work tends to slow or halt in an effort to mitigate potential losses and damage that may occur to the offshore oil and gas infrastructure should a hurricane enter the area. However, demand for offshore marine vessels typically increases in the U.S. GOM in connection with repair and remediation work that follows any hurricane damage to offshore crude oil and natural gas infrastructure. The company’s vessels that operate offshore India in Southeast Asia and in the Western Pacific are impacted by the monsoon season, which moves across the region from November to April. Vessels that operate in the North Sea can be impacted by a seasonal slowdown in the winter months, generally from November to March. Vessels that operate in Australia are impacted by cyclone season from November to April. Customers in this region, where possible, plan business activities around the cyclone season;

however, Australia generally has high trade winds even during the non-cyclone season and, as such, the impact of the cyclone season on any operations in Australia is not significant. Although hurricanes, cyclones, monsoons and other severe weather can have a seasonal impact on operations, the company’s business volume is more dependent on crude oil and natural gas pricing, global supply of crude oil and natural gas, and demand for the company’s offshore support vessel and other services than on any seasonal variation. 
 Employees 
 
As of March 31, 2017, the company had approximately 5,510 employees worldwide, a reduction of approximately 1,040 from March 31, 2016, as a result of our efforts to reduce costs due to the downturn in the offshore oil services industry. The company is not a party to any union contract in the United States but through several subsidiaries is a party to union agreements covering local nationals in several countries other than the United States. In the past, the company has been the subject of a union organizing campaign for the U.S. GOM employees by maritime labor unions. These union organizing efforts have abated, although the threat has not been completely eliminated. If the employees in the U.S. GOM were to unionize, the company’s flexibility in managing industry changes in the domestic market could be adversely affected.
