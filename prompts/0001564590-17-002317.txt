Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of orally administered small molecule drug candidates to fill significant unmet medical needs. We have a powerful pipeline of clinical drug candidates, led by our programs for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (“AD”) and type 2 diabetes. Our drug candidate for the treatment of AD, azeliragon (TTP488), is an orally administered, small molecule antagonist targeting the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (“RAGE”), for which we have commenced patient enrollment and have successfully completed the enrollment of sub-study A in a Phase 3 clinical trial (the “STEADFAST Study”) under a Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) agreed Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”). Our type 2 diabetes drug candidates include TTP399, an orally administered, liver-selective glucokinase activator (“GKA”), for which we have completed a Phase 2b clinical trial (the “AGATA Study”) in August 2016, and TTP273, an orally administered, non-peptide agonist that targets the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (“GLP-1r”), for which we have completed a Phase 2 clinical trial (the “LOGRA Study”) in December 2016. We have three additional programs in various stages of preclinical and clinical development for the prevention of muscle weakness and the treatment of inflammatory disorders.

Our Pipeline
 We discovered our drug candidates internally using our proprietary drug discovery platform, TTP Translational Technology. The following table summarizes our current leading drug candidates and their respective stages of development:
 

Each of our most advanced drug candidates is the subject of patent and patent applications for composition of matter and method of use in major markets worldwide. Our patents in the U.S. are expected to provide us with intellectual property protection through 2029 for azeliragon, 2030 for TTP399 and 2034 for TTP273, in each case, assuming we obtain the maximum possible extensions.
 Our Strategy
 Our goal is to leverage our powerful pipeline of orally administered, small molecule drug candidates to deliver novel, differentiated therapies to fill significant unmet medical needs. As key components of our strategy, we intend to:

• | Continue Phase 3 enrollment and seek regulatory approval of azeliragon as a potential disease-modifying treatment for patients with mild AD. We initiated the STEADFAST Study in April 2015 after receiving positive results from an analysis of data collected in our Phase 2b clinical trial of azeliragon in mild-to-moderate AD patients. The STEADFAST Study is being conducted under an FDA-agreed SPA and will serve as a registration trial for regulatory approval in the United States. We have successfully completed the enrollment of sub-study A of the STEADFAST Study and we expect to report topline data from sub-study A in early 2018 and from sub-study B in the second half of 2018. If results from sub-study A are favorable, we plan to initiate discussions with the FDA regarding an NDA for azeliragon in early 2018 and submit the NDA in late 2018 or early 2019. Additionally, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to azeliragon based on its potential as a disease-modifying therapy.

 Our Alzheimer’s Program – Azeliragon
 Alzheimer’s Disease and the Role of RAGE in its Onset
 AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills, and eventually the ability to carry out simple tasks. Its symptoms include cognitive dysfunction, memory abnormalities, progressive impairment in activities of daily living and a host of behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The exact cause of AD is unknown, however, genetic and environmental factors are established contributors. Amyloid Beta (“Aβ”) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein in the brain are believed to be the main causes of the disease, leading to loss of neuronal connectivity in the brain.
 RAGE is an immunoglobulin-like cell surface receptor that is overexpressed in brain tissues of patients with AD. We believe that RAGE is an important cellular cofactor that binds ligands that are implicated in multiple etiologies of AD, including Aβ transport into the brain, the phosphorylation of tau, chronic inflammation, vascular dysfunction, metabolic dysregulation and neurotoxicity. These effects are attenuated following antagonism of the RAGE receptor.
 Post-mortem studies in AD patients reveal increased RAGE expression in neuronal, microglial and endothelial cells when compared to similar subjects without AD. Cells around senile plaques express higher levels of RAGE during disease progression. Furthermore, expressed levels of RAGE are correlated with the severity of the disease. The data observed in human AD patients is consistent with the multiple pre-clinical in-vitro and in-vivo animal models studied by third parties that show RAGE is overexpressed in brain tissue of AD subjects. Taken together, we believe that literature provides substantial support for RAGE inhibition as a validated and promising therapeutic approach in the treatment of AD.
 
Current Treatments of Alzheimer’s Disease and Their Limitations
 Currently, there are no disease-modifying treatments approved for the treatment of AD, and there are only two classes of approved therapies for the treatment of symptoms of AD: acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (“AChEIs”) and glutamatergic modulators. AChEIs are designed to slow the degradation of acetylcholine, helping to preserve neuronal communication and function temporarily, but do not 
 5

slow or halt neuronal death. Glutamatergic modulators are designed to block sustained, low-level activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (“NMDA”) receptor without inhibiting the normal function of the receptor in memory and cognition, providing temporary symptomatic relief.
 The currently available treatments combat the symptoms of AD rather than the underlying cause, or etiology, and as a result, AD continues to progress in these patients despite treatment. Similarly, the use of antidepressants and antipsychotics are often prescribed off-label to treat the symptoms of severe AD when patients suffer from agitation, aggressive behaviors, psychosis and depression. Recent drug candidates under development include those focused on Aβ synthesis or clearance from the brain, the phosphorylation of tau protein, chronic inflammation, vascular dysfunction, metabolic dysregulation and neurotoxicity.
 
Our Solution: Azeliragon
 Azeliragon is an orally administered, small molecule investigational drug candidate that has the potential to be among the first FDA approved disease-modifying AD therapeutics due to its novel mechanism of action of inhibiting RAGE. Because of that potential, azeliragon has been awarded Fast Track designation by the FDA. The FDA grants Fast Track designation to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs intended to treat serious diseases or conditions and fill an unmet medical need. We have demonstrated that azeliragon is a potent and selective inhibitor of RAGE and, in an analysis of data collected in our Phase 2b clinical trial, azeliragon slowed the progression of cognitive decline in mild and mild-to-moderate AD patients. Azeliragon has the potential to offer a novel modality in AD therapeutics, and we are not aware of any other clinical-stage drugs targeting RAGE. Because there are currently no approved disease-modifying treatments for AD and since currently approved treatments are focused on symptom relief, we believe that azeliragon represents a potential new approach for the treatment of AD. In addition, we believe that in order to successfully treat and combat the physiological progression of AD, a disease-modifying therapeutic must act on multiple causes, or etiologies, of the disease. Unlike development stage disease-modifying treatments that target a singular cause of AD, azeliragon is designed to inhibit RAGE, which affects multiple aspects of AD etiology, including Aβ transport into the brain, the phosphorylation of tau, chronic inflammation, vascular dysfunction, metabolic dysregulation and neurotoxicity.  To date, we have completed six Phase 1 and three Phase 2 clinical trials of azeliragon.
 Ongoing Phase 3 STEADFAST Study
 We initiated our Phase 3 clinical trial, the STEADFAST Study, in April 2015 pursuant to an SPA with the FDA and we have successfully completed the enrollment of sub-study A. The STEADFAST Study, which is being conducted in the United States as well as certain foreign jurisdictions, is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, 18-month trial in patients with mild AD, which is the population that showed greater benefit from azeliragon in an analysis of our Phase 2b trial with patients on standard of care of AChEIs and/or memantine. For the purposes of the STEADFAST Study, patients with a Mini-Mental State Examination (“MMSE”) score of 21 to 26 are considered to have mild AD. The study is conducted under a single protocol and will enroll 800 patients in total, divided equally across two independent 400-patient sub-studies, in which each subject will receive either a 5 mg/day dose of azeliragon or placebo, randomized on a one-to-one basis, added to the standard of care. The sub-studies are independently powered to demonstrate statistically significant differences in co-primary endpoints at month 18. The STEADFAST Study, if successful, will serve as the basis for filing an NDA in the United States and may also serve as a pivotal trial for marketing applications in other jurisdictions. Patients completing the STEADFAST Study may be able to participate in an open-label extension trial until the earlier of the commercial availability of azeliragon, if approved or 24 months from the date of their last visit. 
 The co-primary endpoints for the STEADFAST Study, the change from baseline in the Alzheimer’s Disease Assssment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (“ADAS-COG11”) and the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (“CDR-SB”) scores, are designed to establish efficacy by demonstrating a slowing in the loss of cognition and function in AD patients treated with azeliragon. We are evaluating multiple secondary endpoints, including the key secondary endpoint of MRI brain volumetric measures. We believe that MRI imaging for volumetric measures has the potential to demonstrate modification of the underlying disease by azeliragon.  Sub-study A completed enrollment in September 2016 and topline results are expected in early 2018.  We expect to complete enrollment in sub-study B in June 2017, and topline results from sub-study B are expected in late 2018. If results from sub-study A are favorable, we plan to initiate discussions with the FDA regarding an NDA for azeliragon in early 2018 and submit the NDA in late 2018 or early 2019.
 Completed Phase 2b Trial (TTP488-203)
 Efficacy in Mild-to-Moderate AD Patients
 Our completed Phase 2b clinical trial of azeliragon, TTP488-203, was a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, 18-month trial assessing the safety and efficacy of azeliragon in 399 patients with mild-to-moderate AD, the intent-to-treat (“ITT”) population. Azeliragon or placebo was added to the standard of care, AChEIs and/or memantine. Patients were randomized to receive an oral dose of 20 mg/day of azeliragon, 5 mg/day of azeliragon or placebo. Patients in the high dose azeliragon arm initially received 60 mg/day of azeliragon for six days followed by a daily 20 mg dose, while patients in the low dose arm initially received 15 mg/day of azeliragon for 
 6

six days followed by a 5 mg/day dose.  The study was done in partnership with Pfizer and the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study (“ADCS”).
 The primary endpoint of the study was to impede the progression of AD over 18 months as measured by the change from baseline in ADAS-COG11 score. The secondary endpoints included the changes in global, functional, cognitive and behavioral attributes as measured by CDR-SB, the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living (“ADCS-ADL”), MMSE and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (“NPI”).
 Azeliragon, at the 5 mg/day dose, met its pre-specified ADAS-COG11 endpoint demonstrating a statistically significant 3.1 point difference (p = 0.008) versus placebo at 18 months in patients with mild-to-moderate AD. The results of the primary ADAS-COG11 endpoint are summarized in the figure below.   
 


The above analysis utilizes the analysis of covariance, or ANCOVA, to determine statistical significance, with multiple imputation method to handle missing data, as specified in the protocol for the trial. Additional preplanned statistical analyses of the primary endpoint data, including complete cases ANCOVA, last observation carried forward ANCOVA, generalized estimating equations and mixed model repeated measures, demonstrated that, in each analysis, azeliragon produces statistically significant differences from placebo on ADAS-COG11 (p<0.05).
 The results for global, functional, cognitive and behavioral secondary endpoints after 18 months were also favorable despite the study not being powered to show significance. In each of the CDR-SB, ADCS-ADL, MMSE and NPI, patients in the 5 mg/day dose arm of azeliragon demonstrated numerical improvement compared to the placebo arm. In particular, the CDR-SB score improved by 0.7, the ADCS-ADL score improved by 1.4, the MMSE score improved by 1.0 and the NPI score improved by 1.2. In addition, the 5 mg/day treatment arm of azeliragon exhibited a statistically significant decrease in the incidence of psychiatric adverse events, including a statistically significant decrease in anxiety symptoms.

The results of the secondary endpoints in the ITT population are summarized in the following figures, which, in each case, illustrate a potential benefit of azeliragon versus placebo.

Prior to the completion of the analyses described above, a pre-specified interim safety analysis was conducted when 50% of subjects had completed the six-month visit. The 5 mg/day and placebo groups had no safety concerns. The high dose group was found to be associated with an increased incidence of confusion, falls and greater ADAS-COG11 decline than placebo and was discontinued. The 5 mg/day and placebo groups were allowed to continue without modification after all subjects were re-consented. The cognitive impairment and side effects in the high dose group were demonstrated to be reversible after discontinuing the study drug.
 A second pre-specified interim analysis, which did not include the population receiving the discontinued 20 mg/day dose, was conducted approximately 12 months after all subjects were randomized to compare only the 5 mg/day dose versus placebo for futility and safety. While this second pre-specified interim analysis also raised no concerns regarding safety in the low-dose group, the criterion for futility was met, and the Data Safety Monitoring Board (“DSMB”), recommended discontinuation of the study. Pfizer elected then to discontinue the study. The futility analysis was conducted using data from only 84 patients, rather than the full population of 266 patients, and the data used in the analysis had not yet undergone rigorous database monitoring and error correction. Prior to the final database lock but after the decision to discontinue the study, data entry and scoring errors were found and corrected. Subsequent to the final database lock, we and independent statisticians attempted to replicate the results of Pfizer’s futility analysis but were unable to do so.
 In accordance with the protocol-specified statistical analysis plan, Pfizer and the ADCS performed the analysis of the 5 mg/day dose with respect to the primary ADAS-COG11 endpoint and the secondary endpoints, which produced the positive results described above. Additional analyses that we conducted subsequently also produced results consistent with the results of the protocol-specified analysis. Pfizer reverted the program to us in September 2011 and retains no residual economic rights in the program.
 Efficacy in Mild AD Patients
 Azeliragon at the 5 mg/day dose showed more pronounced efficacy in the mild AD sub-population (MMSE score 21-26) compared to patients with moderate AD (MMSE score 14-20). In the mild AD sub-population including 73 subjects randomized to 
 8

receive drug, azeliragon exhibited a statistically significant 4.0-point difference (p=0.018) in the ADAS-COG11 score relative to the placebo arm, which included 68 subjects. In addition, while the study was not powered to show statistical significance in global, functional, behavioral and cognitive secondary endpoints, the mild AD sub-population demonstrated more pronounced favorable effects in those endpoints, including a statistically significant 1.0-point difference in the CDR-SB score (p=0.02) compared to the placebo group. The additional secondary endpoints demonstrated numerical improvements of 3.2 for the ADCS-ADL score, 1.1 for the MMSE score and 3.1 for the NPI score.
 The results of the primary ADAS-COG11 endpoint in the mild AD population are summarized in the figure below.

The results of the secondary endpoints in the mild AD population are summarized in the following figures, which, in each case, illustrate potential benefits of azeliragon versus placebo.

Adverse Events (Mild to Moderate AD Patients)
 Among the most frequent adverse events (“AEs”) in patients who received the high dose (20 mg/day) of azeliragon were falls (30 / 22.2%), urinary tract infection (“UTI”) (24 / 17.8%), diarrhea (20 / 14.8%), fatigue (19 / 14.1%), dizziness (12 / 8.9%), confusional state (10 / 7.4%) and headache (9 / 6.7%). Falls and UTI were also among the most frequent AEs in patients who received the low dose (5 mg/day) of azeliragon and placebo. The incidences of falls and UTI in the low-dose treatment group were 26 (19.8%) and 21 (16.0%), respectively; the incidences of falls and UTI among patients who received placebo were 26 (19.7%) and 17 (12.9%), respectively.
 10

Of particular note, there was a statistically significant lower incidence of psychiatric AEs in patients receiving 5 mg/day compared to placebo. This was evidenced by a statistically significant lower incidence of anxiety symptoms, along with numerically lower incidence of agitation, depression, sleep disorders, restlessness, aggression and confusion/disorientation.
 


No marked mean vital signs results or changes from baseline were observed in the active treatment groups compared to subjects who received placebo. There were no significant differences in laboratory blood or urine parameters or ECG changes between the three groups. No MRI findings of amyloid-associated imaging abnormalities (“ARIA”) were seen.
 The high dose (20 mg/day) azeliragon arm was discontinued due to an increased incidence of confusion, falls, and an apparent accelerated cognitive decline suggested by a greater change over time in ADAS-COG11 score at a pre-specified interim analysis by an independent DSMB. There were no safety concerns evident in the 5 mg/day dose or placebo and these groups were permitted to continue the trial following re-consenting of subjects. The cognitive impairment and side effects in the 20 mg/day dose were demonstrated to be reversible after discontinuing the study drug. The trajectory of the ADAS-COG11 change from baseline curve over time not only showed the reversal of the transient cognitive worsening but ultimately crossed the placebo curve suggesting a possible underlying effect on the disease process. The mechanism behind the central nervous system (“CNS”) toxicity is unclear, but there were no signs of increased brain atrophy, no change in CSF and plasma levels of Aβ, and no detected amyloid-related imaging abnormalities in the high-dose group.
 Our Diabetes Programs – Glucokinase Activator and GLP-1r Agonist
 Diabetes Overview
 A person suffering from type 2 diabetes does not produce or properly use insulin (a hormone necessary for allowing uptake of sugar from the bloodstream so that it may be converted into energy). In type 2 diabetes, the secretion of insulin from the pancreas and the action of insulin on tissues such as fat and muscle are both abnormal. Type 2 diabetics produce insulin, but insulin production and use both decrease over time as the disease progresses, ultimately requiring insulin administration to manage the disease. Obesity is generally considered the major contributor to the development of type 2 diabetes. As the global obesity epidemic expands, the increase in the number of type 2 diabetes patients has and is expected to continue. With the increasing incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes, we believe there is a significant unmet medical need for treatment alternatives with improved efficacy and safety.
Current Treatments for Diabetes and Their Limitations
 The current treatment paradigm for diabetes focuses on lifestyle changes, including weight loss, if applicable, as well as medications to manage blood glucose levels. Obesity is generally considered the major contributor to the development of type 2 diabetes, and weight loss alone is associated with improvements in glycemic parameters. Optimal glycemic control is the treatment goal in diabetic patients to prevent the risk of long-term microvascular complications. There are currently several classes of drugs approved to improve glycemic control in patients with diabetes, including injectable drugs and oral anti-diabetic drugs (“OADs”). Existing 
 11

injectable therapies include most forms of insulin therapy and GLP-1r agonists. Existing OADs include metformin, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones, with the addition of two new classes in the past few years, DPP-4 and SGLT-2 inhibitors, driving the OAD market’s growth. Despite the range of available therapies, diabetic patients have difficulty achieving and maintaining consistent glycemic control, defined as HbA1c < 7% as recommended by the American Diabetes Association, and eventually progress to insulin use. Failure to attain or maintain glycemic control over time raises a patient’s risk of disease progression with the attendant loss of control and progression to potentially serious complications, such as cardiovascular disease, blindness, kidney failure, and nerve damage. We believe the continued and significant unmet medical need for diabetes treatments is demonstrated by the commercial success of DPP-4 inhibitors, a new class of OADs which were first approved in the United States in 2006 and achieved annual sales of $5.2 billion in 2013.
 We expect our diabetes investigational drug candidates, if approved, to compete in the non-insulin therapy market, currently comprised of OADs and injectable GLP-1r agonists. OADs are the preferred first line treatment by physicians (primary care and endocrinologists), payors and patients given their ease of use, convenience and no training requirements. The goal of these therapies is to delay the progression to insulin dependence (see the figure below). Despite the availability of multiple oral therapies and the introduction of new oral therapies (DPP-4 and SGLT-2 inhibitors) with novel mechanisms, which are used both as monotherapy and in combination with other agents, there remains a lack of differentiation and inadequate efficacy. While GLP-1r agonists are generally considered to have superior efficacy compared with OADs, primary care physicians and patients continue to prefer oral agents for their ease of use and improved patient compliance versus injectables. There remains an unmet medical need in the OAD class for a drug that mimics the superiority of GLP-1r agonists and reduces the incidence of hypoglycemia.
 Progression of type 2 diabetes and treatment intensification using commonly prescribed oral and injectable diabetes drugs is summarized below.
 


Our Solutions: Glucokinase Activator and GLP-1r Agonist
 
With the increasing incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes, we believe there is a significant unmet medical need for treatment alternatives with improved efficacy and safety. We have chosen two different approaches for the treatment of diabetes: activation of GK, 
 12

through our drug candidate TTP399, and stimulation of GLP-1r, through our drug candidate TTP273. If approved, we believe TTP399 and TTP273 could offer attractive alternatives as OADs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
 Glucokinase Activator
 The Role of GK Activation in Diabetes
 GK acts as the physiological glucose sensor, changing its conformation, activity and/or intracellular location in parallel with changes in glucose concentrations. GK has two main distinctive characteristics that make it a good choice for blood glucose control. First, its expression is mostly limited to tissues that require glucose-sensing (mainly liver and pancreatic β-cells). Second, GK is able to sense changes in serum glucose levels and modulate changes in liver glucose metabolism that in turn regulate the balance between hepatic glucose production and glucose consumption, and modulate changes in insulin secretion by the β-cells.
 Studies in humans, along with numerous animal studies, showing that mutations in the gene encoding GK can cause both hyperglycemia (diabetes mellitus) and hypoglycemia (glucose levels below normal) depending on the mutation, confirm the critical role of GK in the regulation of glucose control. The concept of GK activation for the treatment of diabetes is attractive because it has proven to be effective and safe in normalizing glycemia in animal models of type 2 diabetes by a mechanism entirely distinct from the action of antidiabetic therapies currently on the market. Moreover, several lines of evidence have suggested that development of type 2 diabetes is related to functional impairment of the GK enzyme. Thus, GK activation may be a way to overcome an important underlying cause of type 2 diabetes progression and hence halt or delay the course of the disease.
 Many competitors have tried to develop drugs that act as GKAs. Previously identified GKAs evaluated in the clinic for the treatment of type 2 diabetes demonstrate improved glucose control; however, these GKAs showed increased incidence of hypoglycemia and hyperlipidemia and an apparent lack of durability. These liabilities have been correlated to hyperstimulation of the β-cells in a glucose independent manner and/or the accumulation of lipids in the liver, consistent with the disruption of GK and the glucokinase regulatory protein (“GKRP”) interaction by these GKAs. Thus, liver-selective compounds that do not activate GK in pancreatic β-cells or affect the GK-GKRP interaction in the liver are expected to demonstrate a superior profile in comparison to previously identified GKAs.
 TTP399
 TTP399 is an orally administered, small molecule, liver-selective GKA in development as a new potential OAD for the treatment of type 2 diabetes with a novel mechanism of action: liver-selective activation of GK that seeks to provide intensive glycemic control without inducing significant hypoglycemia. If approved, we believe TTP399 would compete primarily with other OADs, including DPP-4 and SGLT-2 inhibitors. Our trials for TTP399 suggest that our approach to GK activation has the potential to avoid the tolerability issues associated with other GKAs, such as activation of GK in the pancreas, stimulation of insulin secretion independent of glucose, hypoglycemia, increased lipids and liver toxicity. Further, we believe that TTP399, if approved, has the potential to normalize HbA1c levels without having contraindication for renal impairment and with little risk of pancreatitis. Based on data from Phase 1 and 2 trials to date, we believe that TTP399, if approved, has the potential to be a first-in-class OAD due to its liver-selectivity and novel mechanism of action.  We are continuing to explore options for further development of this product alone or in collaboration with a partner.
 We have completed nine Phase 1 and two Phase 2 clinical trials of TTP399. In our Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, TTP399 was well tolerated with negligible incidence of hypoglycemia.
 
Completed Phase 2b AGATA Study
 In August 2016, we completed a Phase 2b clinical trial of TTP399, the AGATA Study, which was a six-month trial to demonstrate proof-of-concept that the benefits from TTP399 could be sustained over time. The AGATA Study was a multi-center adaptive Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active- (sitagliptin) controlled, parallel group trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TTP399 following six months of administration in 190 subjects with type 2 diabetes on a stable dose of metformin. Patients had a baseline HbA1c of 7.0 - 9.5%. The AGATA Study included subjects across four arms, including two doses of TTP399 (400 mg and 800 mg), sitagliptin, which is a DPP-4 inhibitor, and placebo.  
 The primary endpoint of the AGATA Study was the change from baseline in HbA1c at six months. The secondary endpoints, included subject achievement of HbA1c < 7% at six months, subject achievement of HbA1c < 6.5% at six months, plasma glucose, lipids (triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol), insulin, lactate, C-peptide, glucagon, GLP-1 and body weight. 
 In the trial, TTP399 demonstrated achievement of the primary endpoint of statistically significant change from baseline in HbA1c at six months of daily administration of 800 mg of TTP399. The reduction in HbA1c was dose-dependent and sustained throughout the duration of the study. TTP399 was also found to be well-tolerated.  
 13

Completed Phase 2a Clinical Trial (TTP399-201)
 We completed a six-week Phase 2a clinical trial of TTP399, a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multiple dose study in 120 type 2 diabetes patients whose glycemic parameters were not well-controlled on metformin. The trial was designed to assess the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability of TTP399 and was conducted at 11 centers in the United States. Patients were randomized into four arms: 29 received TTP399 400 mg twice a day (“BID”), 31 received TTP399 800 mg once a day (“QD”), 30 received TTP399 800 mg BID and 30 received placebo. All patients remained on consistent doses of metformin throughout the trial. HbA1c was generally consistent across arms in the trial with an average of approximately 8.2%.
 In the trial, TTP399 demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c levels in all TTP399 dose groups compared with placebo, without induction of hypoglycemia or hyperlipidemia and with no induction of insulin secretion in patients with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, TTP399 normalized glycemia, defined as HbA1c ≤ 6.5%, after only six weeks of treatment. Specifically, within the high dose arm of TTP399, approximately 86% of patients with HbA1c levels ≤ 7.5% at baseline achieved blood glucose normalization, defined as HbA1c ≤ 6.5%, after six weeks of treatment, while 50% of patients with HbA1c levels ≤ 8% at baseline achieved normalization after six weeks. For all doses combined, approximately 40% of patients with HbA1c levels ≤ 7.5% at baseline achieved blood glucose normalization while 25% of patients with HbA1c levels ≤ 8% at baseline achieved normalization. None of the patients receiving placebo reached HbA1c normalization.
 The results showing the reduction in HbA1c in all subjects and the subgroup with HbA1c levels ≤ 7.5% at baseline are summarized in the following figures:
 


Clinical results also showed a statistically significant effect on both postprandial glucose, fasting glucose, average daily glucose and no increases on fasting plasma lipids or plasma lactate.
 TTP399 was generally safe and well tolerated at all doses in the trial. The proportion of patients reporting at least one AE was between 42% to 63% in the TTP399 groups compared to 40% in the placebo group. There was no notable imbalance in the reporting of any AE between the active trial and the placebo. There were no AEs that led to discontinuation of study drug. There was no dose-responsive increase in the percentages of subjects with at least one AE. One subject in the 800 mg QD group experienced a moderate severe AE of diverticulitis on Day 15 that was considered not related to study drug. No action was taken with study drug, and the event resolved ten days later.
 GLP-1r Agonist
 The Role of GLP-1r Activation in Diabetes
 GLP-1r is a class B, G protein-coupled receptor that regulates important physiological and pathological processes related to type 2 diabetes. GLP-1r stimulation as a therapeutic modality has been validated by the approval of peptide GLP-1r agonists, such as exendin-4 (Byetta) and liraglutide (Victoza). Subcutaneous administration of these peptides lowers blood glucose, decreases HbA1c levels and reduces weight.  However the injectable method of administration has limited their use. This injectible class of peptides is associated 
 14

with gastrointestinal side effects (nausea and vomiting). Despite the clinical success observed with the injectable peptides, no orally available GLP-1r agonists have demonstrated similar success to date.
 TTP273
 TTP273 is a potential first-in-class, orally administered, small molecule, non-peptide GLP-1r agonist. Our past proof-of-concept study with our first generation product, TTP054, demonstrated reductions in HbA1c similar to marketed GLP-1r agonists, and our trials indicated that TTP273 may have acceptable tolerability, as shown through low incidence of gastrointestinal AEs and no antibody formation. We believe an orally administered GLP-1r agonist that mimics the metabolic effects of GLP-1r showing enhanced glycemic control, an improved lipid profile and weight loss, without causing the gastrointestinal side effects typical of this class of compounds, would offer a competitive advantage compared to GLP-1r targeted treatment options currently available. For these reasons, we believe TTP273 has the potential to expand the use of GLP-1r agonists for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
 We have completed two Phase 1 clinical trials and one Phase 2 clinical trial of TTP273. Additionally, we have completed nine Phase 1 clinical trials and one Phase 2 clinical trial of TTP054, which was a predecessor orally administered GLP-1r agonist. In our Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, TTP273 and TTP054 have been well tolerated with negligible incidences of nausea and vomiting. Based on the results of our completed Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials of TTP273 and TTP054, we believe our orally administered GLP-1r agonists have the potential to provide both superior efficacy and tolerability versus peptide GLP-1r analogues.
 
Completed Phase 2 LOGRA Study
 Our completed Phase 2 LOGRA study of TTP273 was a 12-week study conducted in 30 centers in the United States in 174 patients with Type 2 diabetes on stable doses of metformin. In the LOGRA study, the patients were randomized to receive either placebo or TTP273 at doses of 150 mg once or twice daily.  Patients in the once and twice daily treatment arms had mean placebo-subtracted HbA1c differences of -0.86 percent and -0.71 percent, respectively. HbA1c increased by 0.15 percent in patients randomized to placebo. Although the study was not powered to demonstrate weight loss, trends were observed with patients losing on average 0.9 kg and 0.6 kg in the once and twice daily arms, respectively. We are continuing to analyze the full study results.
Completed Phase 2 Study (TTP054-201)
 Our completed Phase 2 clinical trial of TTP054 was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, 12-week, multiple dose study in 187 randomized type 2 diabetic patients who were not well-controlled on metformin. The trial was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of TTP054. The trial was conducted at 19 centers in the United States. Patients were randomized into four arms: 28 to receive TTP054 200 mg/day, 51 to receive TTP054 400 mg/day, 56 to receive TTP054 800 mg/day and 52 to receive placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial was change from baseline in HbA1c as compared to placebo. The secondary endpoints included change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose, subject achievement of HbA1c <7%, change from baseline in body weight, and subject achievement of body weight loss ≥ 2%.
 Our proof-of-concept trial showed statistically significant change in the average level of blood sugar as measured by HbA1c from baseline as compared to placebo. In the trial, there was a reduction of 1% HbA1c in the target population (A1c 8-10%) This reduction was consistent with published data for marketed GLP-1 mimetics (exenatide) in studies of similar duration.

These clinical trials showed that our investigational GLP-1r agonists had negligible incidences of AEs and no increased risk of hypoglycemia when compared to placebo. In our completed Phase 2 trial of TTP054, a total of 178 AEs were reported by 69 of 184 patients, or 38%. The proportion of patients reporting at least one AE was highest in the TTP054 800 mg/day dose group at 45% versus 40% in the placebo group. The proportion of patients that reported at least one AE were lowest in the 400 mg and 200 mg dose groups at 27% and 37%, respectively.
 Overall, in our Phase 2 trial, TTP054 was well-tolerated. There were no hypoglycemia AEs, and GI AEs, including nausea and vomiting, were minimal and similar in incidence and severity in active and placebo groups. There were five subjects with AEs that were considered serious and led to discontinuation from the study. Among these subjects, only two AEs occurred in TTP054-treated subjects (increases in LFTs without increased bilirubin) and were considered related to TTP054. All of these AEs resolved with no sequelae.
 TTP273 was generally well-tolerated in our completed Phase 1 clinical trials, with no severe AEs reported after up to 14 days of dosing. There was no apparent dose relationship and no hypoglycemic incidents.
 Additional Pipeline Opportunities
 Oncology – Hexokinase II Inhibitors
 The field of tumor metabolism seeks to exploit the unique ways in which cancer cells take up and utilize nutrients in order to grow and proliferate. Cancer cells have altered cellular metabolic pathways to acquire and utilize these nutrients and redirect them to provide the necessary building blocks for growth. When these metabolic pathways are blocked, cancer cells are essentially starved of critical nutrients and stop growing or die, whereas normal cells are largely unaffected.
 Most cancer cells have increased uptake of the sugar glucose relative to surrounding normal cells. This phenomenon forms the basis for the widely used tumor imaging procedure known as 18F-2-deoxyglucose (FDG)/PET. Tumors take up more FDG, a radioactive glucose analog, than the surrounding normal tissue and this differential can be visualized with PET imaging. Not only do tumors take up more glucose, they also utilize the nutrient in a unique way. Tumors convert glucose into lactic acid in a process known as aerobic glycolysis or the “Warburg effect,” a route rarely utilized in normal cells. This unique uptake and processing of glucose by tumors relative to normal tissue creates an opportunity to selectively target tumors by cutting off their ability to use this fuel.
 In many cancers, hexokinase II is overexpressed and has been linked to more aggressive and invasive tumors. Pre-clinical studies in mice have confirmed that the reduction of hexokinase II activity through genetic deactivation (siRNA knockdown studies) results in a significant reduction of tumor growth. Our hexokinase inhibitors may provide an opportunity to inhibit the unique way cancer cells utilize glucose, and the overall Warburg effect, which could potentially result in new treatments for cancer.
 Calithera Biosciences, Inc. (“Calithera”) has exclusive, worldwide rights to our hexokinase II inhibitors for research, development and commercialization. We have received an initial license fee from Calithera, and Calithera will pay us potential development and regulatory milestone payments and royalty payments under the agreement. See Intellectual Property – License Agreements – Calithera later in this section for further details.
 Other Candidates
 We are also developing a portfolio of additional investigational drug candidates for the prevention of muscle weakness associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation and critical injury, as well as the treatment of inflammatory disorders.  Such candidates include: (1) a novel PDE4 inhibitor (HPP737) with a low potential for emesis which may allow an expanded therapeutics scope than currently marketed products in Psoriasis and Atopic Dermatitis; and (2) a PPAR-δ agonist (HPP593) that exhibits beneficial effects on lipid profile and slowed muscle loss associated with immobilization in Phase 1 clinical studies.  These additional candidates have been through varying stages of preclinical and Phase 1 testing and we have submitted investigational new drug applications (“INDs”) for certain of them to the FDA.  While our primary focus is on the clinical trials involving azeliragon, TTP399 and TTP273, we plan to continue to evaluate opportunities for furthering the development of these other compounds in our pipeline.  Such development many be done internally or through partnering relationships.
Our Proprietary Technology Platform
 We use a proprietary drug discovery platform that facilitates the discovery of novel drug candidates in a time- and cost-efficient manner. Using this discovery technology, we have completed the discovery phase for some of our most promising candidate drugs in weeks and months, as compared to an industry average of two to three years, and with this technology, we expect to similarly be able to reduce the discovery phase for any future potential drug candidates.

TTP Translational Technology
 We developed a proprietary drug discovery platform called TTP Translational Technology, which we use to discover novel small molecule therapeutics for major diseases and to validate biological pathways and targets. All of the small molecule drug candidates in our pipeline (other than HPP593) were discovered using TTP Translational Technology.
 TTP Translational Technology is a fully integrated drug discovery process, amenable to automation, which works to translate genomic and proteomic data into safe and effective small molecule therapeutics in high-throughput fashion, bypassing most of the classical requirements and bottlenecks in drug discovery. We have used this technology to discover drugs for our internal pipeline and in research collaborations with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.
 Our Integrated Platform
 TTP Translational Technology consists of three modules that are fully integrated with an informatics system that captures data from each optimization cycle of the drug discovery process. This informatics system is built with a sophisticated architecture that supports various computing platforms and provides automatic archiving and storage capabilities. The three modules comprising TTP Translational Technology are:

• | TTPredict provides modeling tools, simulations, statistical and analysis algorithms and visualization in one package. The resulting molecular discovery process couples high throughput in silico and in biologico screening data with extensive automation in a parallel and integrated fashion in order to rapidly develop hypotheses concerning novel protein structures and potential ligand binding sites. The system uses high-throughput virtual docking, ranking and screening and employs multiple scoring methods. These operations are encompassed within component modules known as TTPostGene, TTPSite, TTPDock and TTPSelect.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | TTPSpace is a proprietary library of diverse, drug-like, well characterized compounds (TTProbes and related compound libraries) that can be used in our automated drug discovery processes. We have the capacity to synthesize hundreds if not thousands of well-characterized compounds per day in milligram quantities. TTProbes are an ensemble of functionally diverse, structurally unique and nested low molecular weight molecules exemplifying key recognition elements that enable an immediate interpretation and subsequent extrapolation of the geometric, stereo-electronic and physiochemical requirements for binding to target proteins. These molecular probes deliver a focused yet adjustable technique for lead discovery or target validation, especially when coupled to the computational capabilities embodied in TTPredict. TTProbes are tools for rapid biological target validation, bypassing the often time-consuming process of classical pharmacology requirements, quickly producing data about essential binding elements between biological targets and small molecule modulators. Selectivity and specificity data is generated much earlier compared to hits against a classical library, while minimizing negative prior art issues.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | TTPScreen consists of novel translational biology techniques, including genomic and high-content imaging processes and proprietary tools built with a sophisticated architecture that supports various computing platforms and utilizes dynamic scripting and parallel execution, allowing management of large amounts of biological data generated from high-throughput screening, including complex experimental protocols, flexible and dynamic assay layouts, multiple IC50 determinations, interactive profiling and kinetic studies. TTPScreen allows full utilization and access to all the available biological and chemical data and information in a highly integrated fashion.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 TTP Translational Technology reduces manual tasks, provides rapid validation, lead discovery and optimization of novel clinical candidates, reduces prior art issues associated with leads pulled from classical sources and is capable of addressing the need and demand for complex, non-traditional biological targets such as protein-protein interactions.
 Our average time from biological concept through completion of Phase 1 trials is about four to five years, which is half of the industry average, helping to lower costs and enhance the speed of drug development. Our development methods can be used to identify targets in various therapeutic areas and are scalable to support a large number of programs.
 Third-Party Suppliers and Manufacturers
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to manufacture clinical supplies of our drug candidates and for our other research and discovery programs.

 Trade Secrets
 In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, significant aspects of our TTP Translational Technology are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect, and a number of the individual components of our TTP Translational Technology are now commercially available. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed by employees or through a relationship with a third party. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become publicly known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our contractors use or incorporate intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
License Agreements
 Calithera
 In March 2015, we entered into a License and Research Agreement with Calithera (the “Calithera License Agreement”), under which Calithera obtained an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to develop and commercialize certain of our hexokinase II inhibitors for any therapeutics, prophylactic, preventative or diagnostic use.
 Under the terms of the Calithera License Agreement, Calithera paid us an initial license fee of $600,000, and will pay us potential development and regulatory milestone payments totaling up to $30.5 million for the first licensed product. We are eligible for an additional $77.0 million in potential sales-based milestones, as well as royalty payments, at mid-single digit royalty rates, based on tiered sales of the first commercialized licensed product. In addition, Calithera agreed to fund up to $1.1 million during the first 12 months of the Calithera License Agreement for the costs associated with up to four of our full-time employee equivalents to develop additional hexokinase inhibitors under which the Company has recognized a total of $0.3 million through December 31, 2016. If Calithera develops additional licensed products, after achieving regulatory approval of the first licensed product, Calithera would owe additional regulatory milestone payments and additional royalty payments based on sales of such additional licensed products.
 18

Except for the research program funded by Calithera with us, Calithera will be responsible for the worldwide development and commercialization of the licensed products, at its cost, is required to use commercially reasonable efforts with respect to such development and commercialization activities, and must meet certain specified diligence obligations. Calithera holds the first right to prosecute and to enforce all licensed patents under the Calithera License Agreement throughout the world, and we will retain certain step-in prosecution and enforcement rights.
 The Calithera License Agreement, unless terminated earlier, will continue on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until expiration of the royalty obligations Calithera owes to us on such licensed product, which extend until the later of the expiration of certain patent or data exclusivity rights covering such licensed product in such country or ten years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country. Either party may terminate the Calithera License Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach. Calithera may terminate the Calithera License Agreement at will upon prior written notice. Either party may terminate the Calithera License Agreement for the other party’s insolvency.
 Novo Nordisk
 In February 2007, we entered into an Agreement Concerning Glucokinase Activator Project with Novo Nordisk A/S (the “Novo License Agreement”) whereby we obtained an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under certain Novo Nordisk intellectual property rights to discover, develop, manufacture, have manufactured, use and commercialize products for the prevention, treatment, control, mitigation or palliation of human or animal diseases or conditions. As part of this license grant, we obtained certain worldwide rights to Novo Nordisk’s GKA program, including rights to preclinical and clinical compounds such as TTP399. Under the terms of the Novo License Agreement, we have additional potential developmental and regulatory milestone payments totaling up to $115.0 million for approval of a product. We are also obligated for an additional $75.0 million in potential sales-based milestones, as well as royalty payments, at mid-single digit royalty rates, based on tiered sales of commercialized licensed products.
Columbia University
 In May 2015, we entered into a New Exclusive License Agreement (the “Columbia License Agreement”) with The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York (“Columbia”) whereby we obtained a worldwide, exclusive license, with the right to grant sublicenses under certain Columbia RAGE-related patent rights to discover, develop, manufacture, use, sell, have sold, import, have made, offer to sell, rent, or lease RAGE-inhibiting small molecules, including azeliragon. We also obtained a worldwide right to use certain RAGE-related research information and material. Under the terms of the Columbia License Agreement, we are required to pay an annual fee of $0.1 million, a potential milestone payment of $0.8 million and royalty payments at low-single digit royalty rates based on the net sales of licensed products. At the end of 2021, any fees and payments under the agreement will end, and we will have an irrevocable license to the RAGE-related patent rights, research information and material.
Competition
 The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and generic drug companies. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our drug candidates are efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, mechanism of action, control and predictability, convenience of dosing and price and reimbursement.
 Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 Potential Competing Products – Alzheimer’s Disease
 There are currently no approved disease-modifying treatments for AD in the United States, as existing therapies treat only the symptoms of the disease, rather than targeting the underlying mechanisms. The approved symptomatic AD therapies in the United States fall into two classes, AChEIs and glutamatergic modulators. If azeliragon is approved, its mechanism of action may be complementary to existing standard of care, as well as that of drug candidates with differentiated mechanisms currently in development as potential disease modifying treatments for AD, including anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies, BACE inhibitors, tau aggregation inhibitors and monoamine oxidase-b inhibitors. This will allow the opportunity for co-administration with these other drug candidates if they are successfully developed.  We are not aware of any other clinical-stage RAGE inhibitors investigational products being developed for the treatment of AD.
 19

Potential Competing Products – Type 2 Diabetes
 If approved, we expect that our type 2 diabetes investigational drug candidates will compete with currently available non-insulin medication products for type 2 diabetes. These products include the following:

• | Injectable GLP-1r agonists, such as exenatide or liraglutide, which mimic a naturally occurring hormone that stimulates the pancreas to secrete insulin when blood glucose levels are high.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | DPP-4 inhibitors, such as sitagliptin or saxagliptin, are a class of drugs that work by blocking the enzyme that normally degrades GLP-1.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sulfonylureas and meglitinides, which are classes of drugs that act on the pancreatic cells to stimulate the secretion of insulin.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Thiazolidinediones, such as pioglitizone, and biguanides, such as metformin, which lower blood glucose by improving the sensitivity of cells to insulin, or diminishing insulin resistance.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, which lower the amount of glucose absorbed from the intestines, thereby reducing the rise in blood glucose that occurs after a meal.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | SGLT-2 inhibitors, such as dapagliflozin and canagliflozin, are a class of medications that lower blood glucose by increasing glucose excretion in urine.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to existing marketed products, there are a number of product candidates currently in development focusing on the same mechanisms as our programs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, including:
  
• | Glucokinase activators: Advinus Therapeutics Ltd., Yabao Pharmaceutical Co, Inc., Pegbio Co. Ltd., Hua Medicine Ltd. and Teijin Pharma Limited are among the companies evaluating glucokinase activators in clinical or preclinical studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Oral GLP-1r agonists: Diabetology Ltd., Heptares Therapeutics Ltd., Novo Nordisk, Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc., Poxel SA and Receptos, Inc. are among the companies evaluating oral GLP-1r agonists in clinical or preclinical studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that our investigational drug candidates may offer key potential advantages over these competitive products that could enable our drug candidates, if approved, to capture meaningful market share from our competitors. Nevertheless, many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do, as well as greater experience in the discovery and development of drug candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining regulatory approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug candidate we may commercialize and may render our drug candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of their development and commercialization. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market, existing treatments come off patent, and more advanced technologies become available. Finally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our drug candidates non-competitive or obsolete.
 Collaboration Revenue and Customers
 The majority of our collaboration revenue and accounts receivable are related to the Calithera License Agreement described above. Currently, we do not believe the amounts of revenue generated under the Calithera License Agreement are material to us, since the compounds subject to the Calithera License Agreement are in the pre-clinical stage, and we are focused primarily on our Phase 3 clinical trial, the STEADFAST Study, with respect to azeliragon, and our Phase 2 diabetes investigational products in particular TTP399 and TTP273.
 Government Regulation and Product Approval
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, export and import of products such as those we are developing. Our drug candidates must receive final approval from the FDA before they may legally be marketed in the United States.
U.S. Drug Development Process
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, “FDCA”, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and ensuring compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an 
 20

approval, a hold on clinical trials, warning letters, product seizures, product detention, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to Good Laboratory Practices or other regulations, as well as formulation studies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new drug;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 The testing and approval process require substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our drug candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 Once a pharmaceutical drug candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. The preclinical testing stage includes laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor must also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical trial lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance.
 All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations. These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, an institutional review board (“IRB”), must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at any institution. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical trial and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Once an IND is in effect, each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the IND for FDA review, and to the IRBs for approval.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
  
• | Phase 1. The drug candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing may be conducted in patients having the specific disease.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. Phase 2 trials involve investigations in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the drug candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine optimal dosage and schedule.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in a larger patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the drug candidate and provide an adequate basis for regulatory approval and product labeling.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval studies, also called Phase 4 trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approvals. These studies are used to obtain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and may be required by the FDA as part of the approval process.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected side effects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 
 21

Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution on various grounds, including if the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 Special Protocol Assessment
 The special protocol assessment, or SPA, process is designed to facilitate the FDA’s review and approval of drugs by allowing the FDA to evaluate the proposed design and size of Phase 3 clinical trials that are intended to form the primary basis for determining a drug product’s efficacy. Upon specific request by a clinical trial sponsor, the FDA will evaluate the protocol and respond to a sponsor’s questions regarding, among other things, primary efficacy endpoints, trial design and data analysis plans, within 45 days of receipt of the request.
 The FDA ultimately assesses whether the protocol design and planned analysis of the trial are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the drug candidate with respect to effectiveness of the indication studied. All agreements and disagreements between the FDA and the sponsor regarding an SPA must be clearly documented in an SPA letter or the minutes of a meeting between the sponsor and the FDA.
 Even if the FDA agrees to the design, execution and analyses proposed in protocols reviewed under the SPA process, the FDA may revoke or alter its agreement under the following circumstances:
  
• | public health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the protocol assessment, or the director of the review division determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining safety or efficacy has been identified after testing has begun;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a sponsor fails to follow a protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the relevant data, assumptions or information provided by the sponsor in a request for SPA change, are found to be false statements or misstatements, or are found to omit relevant facts.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A documented SPA may be modified, and such modification will be deemed binding on the FDA review division, except under the circumstances described above, if FDA and the sponsor agree in writing to modify the protocol and such modification is intended to improve the study. We have obtained an SPA with the FDA for our Phase 3 STEADFAST Study of azeliragon. Agreement by the FDA to an SPA does not guarantee that the results of a study conducted in accordance with the agreement will be successful or that other issues that arise may impede approval of the investigational product.
 United States Review and Approval Processes
 The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees which may be waived under certain limited circumstances.
FDA Review of New Drug Applications
 The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing.  The FDA has 60 days to make this determination. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be re-submitted with the additional information. The re-submitted application also is subject to review for completeness before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), the FDA has ten months from the date the application is accepted for filing in which to complete the initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant and six months for a priority NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the chemistry, manufacturing and control documentation is adequate to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA may refer the NDA to 
 22

an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts who provide advice and recommendations when requested by the FDA on matters of importance that come before the agency. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee.
 The approval process is difficult and unpredictable and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information.
 Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA in its present form. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies that the FDA identified in the NDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to conform the application to a condition suitable for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, withdraw the application, or request an opportunity for a hearing.
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs
 The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track designation, accelerated approval and priority review, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
 To be eligible for a Fast Track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA may determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it is expected to provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors.  Fast Track designation allows for more frequent FDA meetings and communications and eligibility for accelerated approval and/or priority review if certain criteria are met.
 The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months from the date of filing of the NDA. Most products that are eligible for Fast Track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
 In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible to receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures.
 Moreover, under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, enacted in 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a drug candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
 23

Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We have obtained Fast Track designation for azeliragon for the treatment of dementia of the Alzheimer’s type.
 Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally (a) one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus (b) the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent and within 60 days of approval of the drug. The PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
 Data and market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data and marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active pharmaceutical ingredient, or active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that references the previously approved drug with exclusivity. Section 505(b)(2) generally permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from clinical trials not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. However, an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application may be submitted after four years if it contains a Paragraph IV certification claiming that the patents covering the drug are either invalid or not infringed by the drug described in the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application. We would expect that our lead investigational drug candidates would qualify for data exclusivity.
 The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, Section 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application. Such clinical trials may, for example, support new indications, dosages, routes of administration or strengths of an existing drug, or a new use. This exclusivity, which is sometimes referred to as clinical investigation exclusivity, prevents the FDA from approving an ANDA or an application under Section 505(b)(2) for the same conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations before the expiration of three years from the date of approval. Such three-year exclusivity, however, would not prevent the approval of another application if the applicant submits a Section 505(b)(1) NDA and has conducted its own adequate, well-controlled clinical trials demonstrating safety and efficacy, nor would it prevent approval of an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application for a product that did not incorporate the exclusivity-protected changes of the approved drug product. We expect that our Alzheimer’s and diabetes investigational products in development would all qualify for clinical investigation exclusivity.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Any drugs for which we receive FDA approval are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. In September 2007, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 was enacted, giving the FDA enhanced post-marketing authority, including the authority to require post-marketing studies and clinical trials, labeling changes based on new safety information, and implementation of risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (“REMS”) programs as mandated by the FDA. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, manufacturers of drugs must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, certain changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to prior FDA review and approval.
 Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the drug. Manufacturers must 
 24

establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards, and test each product batch or lot prior to its release.
 The FDA may restrict market availability or withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product subsequent to its approval may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, warning letters, holds on clinical trials, product seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions or civil or criminal penalties.
 From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. For example, in July 2012, FDASIA was enacted, which, among other things, expanded drug supply chain requirements and strengthened FDA’s response to drug shortages. In addition to new legislation, the FDA regulations and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our drug candidates. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
 Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Foreign Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and may become subject to additional foreign regulations pertaining to commercial sales and distribution of our drug candidates to the extent we choose to clinically evaluate or sell any products outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. As in the United States, post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacture, marketing, or distribution would apply to any product that is approved for sale outside the United States.
 Third-Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any of our drug candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In both the United States and foreign markets, our ability to commercialize our drug candidates successfully, and to attract commercialization partners for our drug candidates, depends in significant part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including, in the United States, governmental payors such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, managed care organizations, and private health insurers. Medicare is a federally funded program managed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, through local administrative contractors that administer coverage and reimbursement for certain healthcare items and services furnished to certain individuals aged 65 or older, disabled or suffering from end-stage renal disease. Medicaid is an insurance program for certain categories of patients whose income and assets fall below state defined levels and who are otherwise uninsured that is both federally and state funded and managed by each state. The federal government sets general guidelines for Medicaid and each state creates specific regulations that govern its individual program. Each payor has its own process and standards for determining whether it will cover and reimburse a procedure or particular product. The Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly are used as models for how private payors and other governmental payors develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for drugs and biologics. Therefore, achieving favorable coverage and reimbursement from government payors is usually a significant gating issue for successful introduction of a new product. The competitive position of some of our products will depend, in part, upon the extent of coverage and adequate reimbursement for such products and for the procedures in which such products are used. 
 25

Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our drug candidates can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by the government and other payors and may require us to pay significant rebates.
 The U.S. Congress and state legislatures may, from time to time, propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment, which could impact our ability to sell our drug candidates profitably. For example, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which we refer to collectively as the Affordable Care Act, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Effective October 1, 2010, the Affordable Care Act revised the definition of “average manufacturer price” for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states once the provision is effective. Further, the law imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. The Affordable Care Act also addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, and established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare practitioners. We will not know the full effects of the Affordable Care Act until applicable federal and state agencies issue final regulations or guidance under the new law. Although it is too early to determine the effect of the Affordable Care Act, the new law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.  However, due to the presidential transition in 2017, the future of the Affordable Care Act is uncertain.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. These automatic reductions include aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our drug candidates or additional pricing pressures.
 The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental, media and other third-party payor interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative proposals. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by current and future healthcare reforms.
 Some third-party payors also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers that use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on the pricing for our drug candidates and our ability to operate profitably.
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including CMS, other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. The laws we are subject to include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations.
 The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) is the statute that provides the FDA with authority to oversee the safety and approval of pharmaceutical products. The FDCA vests authority with FDA to conduct inspections sponsors conducting pharmaceutical development, such as vTv, to protect the rights, safety and welfare of clinical trial subjects, ensure the accuracy and reliability of clinical trial data, and verify compliance with FDA regulations. The FDCA sets forth the standards for approval of new and generic drugs, as well as setting forth the prohibition on marketing investigational products that have not been approved by the FDA as safe and effective. The government (FDA and SEC) use the FDCA to ensure that companies do not mislead the medical, patient or investor communities about investigational products prior to their approval. To that end, the FDCA prohibits “off-label promotion” of any investigational or approved product for any uses, doses or populations, except that set forth in the full prescribing information approved by the FDA. 
 26

While physicians can prescribe a product for any dose, purpose or population in their medical judgment, manufacturers can only market products for their FDA-approved dose, purpose and population. There are significant civil and criminal penalties that attach to violations of the FDCA, including strict liability misdemeanors for responsible corporate officers, even if such officers were not involved in or aware of the underlying wrongdoing.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations. In the past, the government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
 Additionally, the civil False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the United States government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) also created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 There has also been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposes new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members (also known as the Sunshine Act). Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Drug manufacturers are required to submit reports to the government by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. While we are not currently subject to the reporting requirements of the Sunshine Act, we are committed to complying with industry standards and best practices, and only paying fair market value for services provided by healthcare professionals and others.
 We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 27

Based on the conduct of some of our clinical trials oversees, we are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act that prohibits payments to foreign public officials relating to official acts. In addition to its prohibition on bribery of foreign government officials, the Act requires companies to maintain accurate records and have vigorous internal controls. The DOJ and SEC have made FCPA enforcement a high priority. In addition, other anti-corruption laws such as the UK Bribery Act are even broader than the FCPA in that they apply to bribes offered to any person, not just government officials. There are significant criminal and civil penalties and fines that attach to violations of the FCPA.
