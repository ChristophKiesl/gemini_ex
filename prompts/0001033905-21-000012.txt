ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview

We develop, manufacture and sell proprietary biological testing technologies and products with applications throughout the life sciences industries, including diagnostics, pharmaceutical and research. These industries depend on a broad range of tests, called assays, to perform diagnostic testing and conduct life science research. We have established a position in several segments of the life sciences industries by developing and delivering products that satisfy a variety of customer needs in specific market segments, including multiplexing, accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, reduction of labor and ability to test for proteins and nucleic acids. These needs are addressed by our proprietary technologies. 
Multiplexing, the foundation of our Company, allows the end user in a laboratory to generate multiple laboratory results from a single sample with a single assay. This is important because our end user customers, which include laboratory professionals performing discovery and research, and clinical laboratories performing tests on patients as ordered by physicians and other laboratories, have a fundamental need to perform high quality testing as efficiently as possible. Until the availability of multiplexing technology, the laboratory professional had to perform one assay at a time in a sequential manner, and if additional testing was required on a sample, a second assay would be performed to generate the second result, and so on until all the necessary tests were performed. 
Business Strategy 
 Our Company’s current focus is both on solidifying our leadership position as a provider of effective tools for diagnostic and research use, as well as establishing Luminex as a market leader in the molecular diagnostic market. To achieve these objectives, we have implemented and are pursuing the following strategies:
•Focus on key markets
We have identified the following goals in our key market segments: (i) expanding usage of our automated molecular infectious disease testing solutions, (ii) enabling and expanding end markets for our xMAP technologies through our partnership arrangements, and (iii) developing and expanding the image-based flow cytometry market. We will continue to employ a combination of a product-driven direct sales model focused on select market segments and assay applications and a partnership-driven business model to achieve our goals.
•Develop and deliver market-leading molecular diagnostic platforms and assays
Our research and development and our acquisition activity have expanded the breadth of technologies and solutions we offer our customers to meet their needs. In addition, we collaborate with industry participants, biomedical research institutions and government entities to develop additional products on our platforms, and we continuously consider other adjacent markets where our platforms and assay offerings would be beneficial.
In March 2020, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) awarded the Company two milestone-based contracts related to the development of diagnostics for SARS-COV-2, with a value of $642,450 each, funding approximately 36% of the overall cost of development. The Company’s management believes these two contracts helped to enable an expansion of the Company’s current portfolio of diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). In September 2020, BARDA awarded the Company two additional milestone-based contracts valued at $5,389,813 and $683,500, respectively, related to completing a 510(k) filing for Luminex’s expanded NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel (RPP), which will include the SARS-CoV-2 virus for COVID-19 testing and to support the enhancement of the Company’s xMAP SARS-CoV-2 Multi-Antigen IgG Assay. The Company intends to submit this enhanced serology assay for an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) when this project is completed.
Based upon our understanding of the needs of our customers to address the impacts of COVID-19, in addition to the above, the Company intends to include diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 in future syndromic panels. 
We also offer our VERIGENE System, which provides automated, cost-effective multiplex capabilities that rapidly and accurately detect infectious pathogens and drug resistance markers, without relying on time-consuming culture methods. We believe the VERIGENE System delivers better outcomes, improved patient care, earlier optimization for patient treatment and improved laboratory and hospital efficiency, all at a lower cost than competing systems. We currently offer assays on the VERIGENE platform in the categories of Bloodstream Infection Tests, Gastrointestinal Infection Tests and a Respiratory Infection Test. 
We also are developing the VERIGENE II System, having initiated clinical studies on the system and its first assay in 2018. We currently expect to commercially launch the VERIGENE II System in 2021. 
In addition, we have improved the simplicity and ease-of-use of our xMAP-based multiplex products through the development of a version of our multiplex PCR technology. This NxTAG chemistry streamlines workflow without sacrificing throughput, preserving the ability to process 1 to 96 patient samples in a single batch. This throughput flexibility and capacity is a crucial aspect for tests like our NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel (RPP), in which seasonality and local outbreaks can cause testing volumes to surge unpredictably. We continue to pursue projects such as development of consumables, automation, software and the expansion and enhancement of our multiplexing capabilities to advance our technologies and improve market acceptance.
We are working on the development of the xMAP INTELLIFLEX instrument, a next generation bead-based multiplexing system. This new system will provide the opportunity to address both expanding and evolving market needs, plus offer an opportunity for existing users to upgrade to a modernized version of bead-based multiplexing. We currently expect to commercially launch this system in the first half of 2021.
We have developed a full range of multiplexing instruments and consumables to cover a broad range of customer applications and budgets. We have developed, and continue to improve, our proprietary chemistries for our multiplex assays in areas such as infectious disease testing, human genetic testing and personalized medicine testing. All of these technology solutions provide our customers with a breadth of innovative solutions to meet their many testing needs.
We have plans to submit additional assays to regulatory authorities in 2021, including the FDA and foreign equivalents, for market authorization in order to comply with established guidelines across the jurisdictions in which we compete.
Additionally, we intend to expand our presence in the image-based, flow cytometry market with our proprietary technology that provides microscopy-quality images of individual cells. The new product will evolve our flagship Amnis ImageStream platform to deliver a simplified user experience with enhanced performance and functionality. The improvements made with this new product should both further advance scientific discovery and expand adoption. Advances in instrument design should also improve image definition, accelerate data acquisition, and increase system flexibility. Finally, new data analysis capabilities should improve system usability to enable a greater range of applications with less user effort.
•Actively pursue acquisitions to accelerate our business strategies
We actively assess potential acquisition targets to accelerate our business strategies in the key markets described above. This approach led to several successful acquisitions historically, including GenturaDx, which is the foundation of our ARIES System, Nanosphere, which is the foundation of the VERIGENE System and EMD Millipore Corporation’s flow cytometry portfolio. We actively evaluate opportunities to enhance our capabilities or our access to targeted markets and technologies, to provide us other advantages in executing our business strategies in our key markets.
•Continue to develop the partnership channel focused on select key markets
As of December 31, 2020, 54 of our 82 strategic partners have developed and commercialized xMAP-based assays and are paying royalties to us. We also have strategic partners who distribute Luminex products. During 2020, the 54 strategic partners who have commercialized xMAP-based assays accounted for approximately 31% of our total revenue and all of our strategic partners represented approximately 33% of our total revenue. Of these 54 strategic partners, 27 principally serve the clinical diagnostics market and 27 principally serve the life science research market. We intend to continue pursuing opportunities to expand market acceptance of xMAP technology through development, marketing and distribution partnerships with leading companies in the life sciences markets. By leveraging our strategic partners’ market positions and utilizing their distribution channels and marketing infrastructure, we believe we can continue to expand our installed instrument base. 
Furthermore, our partners’ investments in research and development for xMAP applications provide customers vastly more assay solutions than we could develop and commercialize individually.

    We continue to focus our commercialization efforts through our strategic partners covering large sectors of the life science research market, where Luminex believes it has competitive advantages over alternative technologies and approaches. We define strategic partners as those companies in the life sciences markets that develop and distribute assays and tests on xMAP technology or that may only distribute our xMAP technology-based systems and consumables. With our partners’ support and through our direct commercial efforts in the molecular diagnostics clinical laboratory segment, we have targeted major pharmaceutical companies, large clinical laboratories, research institutions and major medical institutions for our principal marketing efforts. We believe that these customers provide the greatest opportunity for maximizing the use of xMAP-based products and that continued adoption by these industry leaders will promote wider market acceptance of our xMAP technology. 
Market Approach / Sales and Marketing 
 Our three primary focus areas for continued revenue growth, as well as our sales and marketing strategies to achieve such growth, are as follows:
 1. Molecular Diagnostics: the development and sale of molecular diagnostic assays utilizing our proprietary MultiCode, xMAP and VERIGENE technologies for use on our installed base of automated and non-automated systems. Our molecular diagnostic assay sales and marketing strategy is to expand the installed base and utilization of xMAP, xTAG, NxTAG, ARIES and VERIGENE product lines. We sell the xTAG, NxTAG, MultiCode, ARIES and VERIGENE product lines primarily through a direct sales channel. Building a direct relationship with customers is a critical component of our sales and marketing strategy to launch innovative products such as our VERIGENE Systems, NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel (RPP) and ARIES Systems. In addition, we market and sell our clinical diagnostics products to group purchasing organizations (GPOs) and integrated healthcare delivery networks. These efforts support and enable our selling efforts to individual laboratories, for example, by contracting with GPOs to provide standardized pricing and terms for member hospitals. Our assays are primarily focused on multiplexed applications for the human molecular clinical diagnostics market and are also focused on three segments of the molecular diagnostic testing market: infectious disease, human genetics and personalized medicine. 
 2. Licensed Technologies Group (LTG): the sustained expansion of our partnership revenues through the introduction of an innovative new xMAP system and continued fulfillment of our partner's needs in their respective fields of use, as well as supporting the kit development and testing services developed or performed by partners who generate royalties. Our strategic partners include market leaders in immune/clinical diagnostics, protein diagnostic, pharmaceutical and life sciences companies that develop applications and/or provide testing services using our xMAP technology platforms. Some partners also distribute xMAP Systems to their customers. Our LTG sales and marketing strategy also includes generating recurring revenues from the sale of Luminex developed assays, microspheres and other consumables, 
 We continue to work with these strategic partners as the primary distribution channel for our xMAP Systems, and we will continue to pursue new partnerships focusing on partners with market presence in the key partner segments described below. Some of our strategic partners develop application-specific kits for use on our xMAP Systems that they, in turn, sell to their customers, thereby generating royalties for us. Certain strategic partners also perform testing services for third parties using our xMAP products, which also result in royalty revenue. We also contract with distributors to purchase and resell xMAP Systems and consumables in geographic or application-specific areas not covered by strategic partners.
 We update our LTG listing regularly to reflect partner consolidations resulting from mergers and acquisitions, commercial sales inactivity, as well as termination or expiration of existing non-performing partner agreements. We also believe our strategic partners provide us with complementary capabilities in product development, regulatory expertise and sales and marketing. By leveraging our strategic partners’ assay development capabilities, customer relationships and distribution channels, we believe that we can continue to achieve measurable market penetration and product adoption. Our current partners are in various stages of development and commercialization of products that incorporate our technology.
 We also serve as an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for certain strategic partners who choose to sell components of the xMAP product line as an embedded system under their own branding and marketing efforts. Luminex and these partners have sold more than 17,900 xMAP-based instruments in laboratories worldwide as of December 31, 2020, some of which may be retired or otherwise not in use.
 3. Flow Cytometry: the continued innovation of our proprietary image-based flow cytometry technology, and expansion of all of our platforms into existing and additional markets. Our flow cytometry sales and marketing strategy is to become a global leader in flow cytometry, competing in all markets with disruptive and differentiated solutions by expanding our position in the research markets, building our diagnostic capabilities and increasing content generation. We are pursuing this strategy by leveraging our pipeline of new product launches and expanding our positions in the pharma, academic, diagnostics and industrial markets, which we believe will allow us to grow our recurring revenue in service, research and clinical reagents, and clinical trial solutions and drive geographic expansion in both established and developing markets.
 We sell the Amnis and Guava Flow Cytometry Systems through a direct sales channel in developed markets in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia-Pacific region, and through distribution partners in emerging markets in Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America. Our flow cytometry business has built healthy relationships with its customer base and has a reputation for quality customer support through its sales team and field application scientists, as well as technical service and instrument repair teams. We anticipate continuing to leverage these strengths to expand our installed base of instruments and concomitant recurring sales of reagents, software licenses and services.

Supply Chain
    We have historically purchased many of the components and raw materials used in our products from numerous suppliers worldwide. For reasons of quality assurance, sole source availability and cost-effectiveness, certain components and raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are available only from one supplier. We have worked closely with our suppliers to develop contingency plans to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability, and in some cases, we have established long-term supply contracts with our suppliers. Due to the high standards and FDA requirements applicable to the manufacturing of our products, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials. In the event that we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials or components on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner, our ability to manufacture our products on a timely and cost-competitive basis may be compromised, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Instruments
    Component suppliers and contract manufacturers provide certain components and component assemblies of our xMAP and ARIES Systems. The remaining assembly and manufacturing of our systems are performed at our facilities in Austin, Texas and Northbrook, Illinois. The quality control and quality assurance protocols are all performed at our facilities. Parts and component assemblies that comprise our technology systems are obtained from a number of sources. We have identified alternate sources of supply for several of our strategic parts and component assemblies. Additionally, we have entered into supply agreements with most of our suppliers of strategic parts and component subassemblies to help ensure component availability and flexible purchasing terms with respect to the purchase of such components. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 17,900 Luminex multiplexing analyzers have been shipped since 1999, some of which may be retired or otherwise not in use.
Microspheres
    We procure our undyed, standard MicroPlex microspheres and manufacture our magnetic MagPlex carboxylated polystyrene microspheres. We synthesize our dyes and manufacture our dyed microspheres using a proprietary method in our Austin, Texas manufacturing facility in large lots. We dye the microspheres with varying intensities of red and near infrared dyes to produce our distinctly colored microsphere sets. We currently purchase the standard polystyrene microspheres from one supplier, in accordance with a supply agreement. We believe this agreement will help ensure microsphere availability and flexible purchasing terms with respect to the purchase of such microspheres. While we believe the microspheres will continue to be available from our supplier in quantities sufficient to meet our production needs, we believe our in-house manufacturing capabilities along with other potential suppliers would provide sufficient microspheres for us if given adequate lead-time to manufacture the microspheres to our specifications.
Assays and Reagents
    Component suppliers and contract manufacturers produce certain components of our developed reagents. The remaining assembly and manufacturing of our on-market kits are performed at one of our facilities in Austin, Texas, Toronto, Canada, Madison, Wisconsin, Northbrook, Illinois, or Seattle, Washington. The quality control and quality assurance protocols are all performed at our facilities. Reagents, consumables and other raw material that comprise our kits are obtained from a number of sources.
    In addition to developed assay kits, increasing regulatory requirements coupled with rising demand for new clinical applications are driving demand for laboratory developed tests. Our proprietary technologies and platforms offer a unique combination of flexibility and throughput, as our systems’ open architecture, software and standard protocols allow our customers the ability to use our proprietary reagents to validate and verify a new test, while being able to utilize the same system to handle increasing volumes once the assay is commercialized.
Competition 
    We design our xMAP Systems and consumables for use by customers across the various segments of the life sciences, pharmaceutical and clinical diagnostic industries. Our xTAG, NxTAG, MultiCode, ARIES and VERIGENE products are developed specifically for the molecular diagnostic segment. Our competition includes companies marketing conventional testing products based on established technologies such as ELISA, real-time PCR, mass spectrometry, gene sequencing, biochips, arrays and flow-based technologies, as well as next generation sequencing and companies developing their own advanced testing technologies.
    The pharmaceutical industry is a large market for the genomic, protein and high-throughput screening applications supported by xMAP Technology. In each application area, Luminex faces a different set of competitors. Genomic and protein testing can be performed by products available from Affymetrix, Inc. (a Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. brand), Life Technologies Corporation (a Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. brand), Becton, Dickinson and Company, Illumina, Inc., Qiagen N.V., Meso Scale Discovery (a division of Meso Scale Diagnostics LLC), Quanterix Corporation, PerkinElmer, Inc., Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., and others.
    Our diagnostic market competitors include, among others, Abbott Laboratories, Life Technologies Corporation (a Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. brand), BioFire Diagnostics, LLC (a bioMérieux company), Cepheid (a Danaher Corporation company), GenMark Dx, Roche Diagnostics, Siemens Medical Solutions, Hologic, Inc., Alere (now part of Abbott Laboratories), Quidel Corporation, Focus Diagnostics (DiaSorin S.p.A), T2 Biosystems, Inc., Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc., Meridian Bioscience, Inc., and Illumina, Inc. Some of these companies have technologies that can run a variety of established assays. In addition, certain of these companies offer integrated systems and laboratory automation that are designed to meet the need for improved work efficiencies in the clinical laboratory.
    Competition within the academic biomedical research market is highly fragmented. There are hundreds of suppliers to this market including, among others, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, a part of GE Healthcare, Life Technologies Corporation (a Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. brand) and Becton, Dickinson and Company.
    Flow cytometry is a well-established field that has grown into a multi-billion dollar market, including research and clinical systems and applications. Competition for our flow cytometry systems is expanding as established competitors consolidate their positions and new competitors and technologies enter and grow within the field. BD Biosciences and Beckman Coulter are long-time leaders in the field and hold the majority of the market share. Mid-term competitors include Miltenyi Biotec, Bio-Rad, Sony Biotechnology, and Attune (part of ThermoFisher Scientific). Newer competitors include ACEA Biosciences, Cytek Biosciences. Our imaging flow cytometry systems cross over into both imaging and microscopy areas and face a number of competitors in these fields, as well as new competitors developing imaging-in-flow systems.
Intellectual Property
    To establish and protect our proprietary technologies and products, we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements. We have filed for registration or obtained registration for trademarks used with our products and key technologies.
    We have implemented a strategy designed to optimize our intellectual property rights. For core intellectual property, we are pursuing patent coverage in the United States and those foreign countries that correspond to the majority of our current and anticipated customer base. We currently own 821 issued patents worldwide directed to various aspects and applications of our products and technology, including 237 issued patents in the United States. Other countries in which we have issued patents directed to various aspects and applications of our products and technology include, among others, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, the Netherlands, Canada, Hong Kong, China and South Korea. Our patent portfolio also includes 110 pending patent applications in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions. We believe our patents and pending patent applications provide, or will provide, protection for systems and technologies that allow real-time multiplexed analytical techniques for the detection and quantification of many analytes from a single sample. We also hold patents covering the fluorescently dyed, magnetically responsive microspheres. In addition, multiple granted patents and pending applications describe aspects of MultiCode technology, xTAG technology, nanoparticle technology, the ARIES and VERIGENE Systems, NxTAG technology, imaging flow cytometry technology and capillary flow cytometry technology.
    The source code for our proprietary software is protected as a trade secret and/or as a copyrighted work. Aspects of the software also are covered by issued patents.
    We also rely on trade secret protection of our intellectual property. We attempt to protect our trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with strategic partners, third parties, employees and consultants. Our employees and third-party consultants also sign agreements requiring that they assign to us their interests in inventions and original works of expression and any corresponding patents and copyrights arising from their work for us. See Item 1A, Risk Factors - “The property rights we rely upon to protect the technologies underlying our products may not be adequate to maintain market exclusivity. Inadequate intellectual property protection could enable third parties to exploit our technologies or use very similar technologies and could reduce our ability to distinguish our products in the market.”
Government Regulation
    Our products are generally considered medical devices and are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA and similar agencies outside the United States. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of our medical devices. Our business is also affected by the United States and foreign patient privacy laws, cost containment initiatives and environmental health and safety laws and regulations. The primary laws and regulations that are particularly relevant to our business are described below.
Food and Drug Administration
    In general, the products that we manufacture are considered to be medical devices and are subject to regulation in the United States by the FDA. We also manufacture versions of the Luminex instruments for use with diagnostic assay kits that are available through our strategic partners. For FDA purposes, Luminex systems are considered components of our partners’ kit products. Kits manufactured by our strategic partners used in conjunction with our technology may be subject to clearance or approval requirements and other FDA regulations.
    The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes on the basis of the intended use of the device, the risk associated with the use of the device for that indication, as determined by the FDA, and on the controls deemed by the FDA to be necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness. Class I devices, which have the lowest level of risk associated with them, are subject to general controls. Class II devices are subject to general controls and special controls, including performance standards. Class III devices, which have the highest level of risk associated with them, are subject to general controls and premarket approval. Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempt from a requirement that the manufacturer submit a premarket notification, or 510(k), and receive clearance from the FDA, which is otherwise a premarketing requirement for a Class II device. Class III devices may not be commercialized until a premarket approval application (PMA) is submitted to and approved by the FDA.
510(k) Clearance Pathway
    To obtain 510(k) clearance, a sponsor must submit to the FDA a premarket notification demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent (SE) to a device legally marketed in the U.S. for which a PMA was not required. The FDA is supposed to make a SE determination within 90 days of FDA’s receipt of the 510(k), but it often takes longer if the FDA requests additional information. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new clearance or possibly a pre-market approval. 
Emergency Use Authorization
In emergency situations, such as a pandemic, the FDA has the authority to allow unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of cleared or approved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear warfare threat agents when there are no adequate, approved and available alternatives.
Under this authority, the FDA may issue an EUA for an unapproved device if the following four statutory criteria have been met: (1) a serious or life-threatening condition exists; (2) evidence of effectiveness of the device exists; (3) a risk-benefit analysis shows that the benefits of the product outweigh the risks; and (4) no other alternatives exist for diagnosing, preventing or treating the disease or condition. Evidence of effectiveness includes medical devices that “may be effective” to prevent, diagnose or treat the disease or condition identified in a declaration of emergency issued by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. The “may be effective” standard for EUAs requires a lower level of evidence than the “effectiveness” standard that the FDA uses for product clearances or approvals in non-emergency situations. The FDA assesses the potential effectiveness of a possible EUA product on a case-by-case basis using a risk-benefit analysis. In determining whether the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks, the FDA examines the totality of the scientific evidence to make an overall risk-benefit determination. Such evidence, which could arise from a variety of sources, may include (but is not limited to) results of domestic and foreign clinical trials, in vivo efficacy data from animal models, in vitro data, as well as the quality and quantity of the available evidence. 
Once granted, an EUA will remain in effect and generally terminate on the earlier of (1) the determination by the Secretary of HHS that the public health emergency has ceased or (2) a change in the approval status of the product such that the authorized use(s) of the product are no longer unapproved. After the EUA is no longer valid, the product is no longer considered to be legally marketed and one of the FDA’s non-emergency premarket pathways would be necessary to resume or continue distribution of the subject product.
The FDA also may revise or revoke an EUA if the circumstances justifying its issuance no longer exist, the criteria for its issuance are no longer met, or other circumstances make a revision or revocation appropriate to protect the public health or safety. 
On January 31, 2020, the Secretary of HHS issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19. On February 4, 2020, HHS determined that COVID-19 represents a public health emergency that has a significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of U.S. citizens living abroad and, subsequently, declared on March 24, 2020, that circumstances exist to justify the authorization of emergency use of medical devices, including alternative products used as medical devices, during the COVID-19 pandemic, subject to the terms of any authorization as issued by the FDA. On February 29, 2020, the FDA issued an immediately in effect guidance with policy specific to development of in vitro diagnostic tests during the COVID-19 public health emergency. This guidance was updated on March 16, 2020, May 4, 2020 and May 11, 2020.
Clinical Trials
    Clinical trials are usually required to support a PMA and are sometimes required for a 510(k). In the U.S., if the device is determined to present a “significant risk,” the manufacturer may not begin a clinical trial until it submits an investigational device exemption application (IDE) and obtains approval of the IDE from the FDA. These clinical trials are also subject to the review, approval and oversight of an institutional review board (IRB) at each clinical trial site. The clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations and good clinical practices. A clinical trial may be suspended by the FDA, the sponsor or an IRB at its institution at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to the study participants outweigh the benefits of participation in the trial. Even if a clinical trial is completed, the results may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a device to the satisfaction of the FDA, or may be equivocal or otherwise not be sufficient to obtain approval of a device.
FDA Enforcement
    After a medical device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include among other things:
•establishment registration and device listing;
•the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
•labeling regulations and the FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or “off-label” uses and other requirements related to promotional activities;
•medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or if their device malfunctioned and the device or a similar device marketed by the manufacturer would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
•corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDC Act) that may present a risk to health; and
•post-market surveillance regulations, which apply to certain Class II or III devices when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
    To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, medical device manufacturers are subject to market surveillance and periodic, pre-scheduled and unannounced inspections by the FDA. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include sanctions, including but not limited to, warning letters; fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; recall or seizure of the device; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusal to grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals of new devices; withdrawal of 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals; and civil or criminal prosecution.
On June 26, 2020, the Company received a warning letter (Warning Letter) from the FDA relating to the operations of the Company’s Austin, Texas and Northbrook, Illinois facilities (Facilities) and the Company’s VERIGENE Processor SP System. The Warning Letter resulted from inspections held at the Facilities from February 10, 2020 to February 14, 2020. The company submitted a comprehensive response to each of these inspections. The subsequently issued Warning Letter primarily relates to the Company’s VERIGENE SP instrument and its hybridization heater in connection with certain FDA requirements under the Quality System Regulation (21 C.F.R. Part 820) and the regulation of Medical Device Corrections and Removals (21 C.F.R. Part 806).
The Company timely submitted a response and corrective action plan to the FDA regarding the issues raised in the Warning Letter, as requested by the FDA, and continues working diligently and expeditiously to resolve the issues raised by the FDA. The Warning Letter did not restrict the manufacture, production or shipment of any of the Company’s products, nor require the withdrawal of any product from the marketplace. The Company believes it has taken, and is continuing to take, appropriate measures to address the items identified by the FDA with respect to the VERIGENE SP instrument and its hybridization heater, and the Company included communication of these measures in its response to the Warning Letter. Specifically, we recalled affected products from the field and replaced them with new units. Additionally, we are executing a field action to re-calibrate all VERIGENE SP instruments deployed in the field with in-house built and verified temperature verification fixtures by March 18, 2021. In addition, the Company continues to evaluate what further corrective or preventive actions may be required.
The Company has responded to the FDA’s concerns raised in the Warning Letter but cannot give assurances that the FDA will be satisfied with its response to the Warning Letter or that such actions will sufficiently resolve the issues identified in the Warning Letter. Failure to promptly and fully address the issues raised in the Warning Letter to the FDA’s satisfaction or to comply with U.S. medical device regulatory requirements in general could result in further regulatory and enforcement actions being initiated by the FDA. These actions could result in, among other things, product recalls, product seizures, injunctions, civil monetary penalties, further delays in obtaining marketing authorization for products, an impact on federal contracts, limitations on our ability to export products and criminal enforcement actions. Any such actions could disrupt our ongoing business and operations and potentially have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Research Use Only Products 
    Some of our products are currently intended for research use only (RUO) applications, although our customers may use our products to develop their own products that are separately subject to regulation by the FDA. Although most products intended for RUO are not currently subject to clearance or approval by the FDA, RUO products fall under the FDA’s jurisdiction if they are used for clinical rather than research purposes. Consequently, these products are labeled “For Research Use Only.”
    On November 25, 2013, the FDA issued Final Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff on “Distribution of In Vitro Diagnostic Products Labeled for Research Use Only or Investigational Use Only,” (the RUO/IUO Guidance). The purpose of an FDA guidance document is to provide the FDA’s current thinking on when IVD products are properly labeled for RUO or for Investigational Use Only (IUO), but as with all FDA guidance documents, this guidance does not establish legally enforceable responsibilities and should be viewed as recommendations unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The RUO/IUO Guidance explains that the FDA will review the totality of the circumstances when evaluating whether equipment and testing components are properly labeled as RUO. Merely including a labeling statement that a product is intended for research use only will not necessarily exempt the device from the FDA’s 510(k) clearance, premarket approval, or other requirements, if the circumstances surrounding the distribution of the product indicate that the manufacturer intends its product to be used for clinical diagnostic use. These circumstances may include written or verbal marketing claims or links to articles regarding a product’s performance in clinical applications, a manufacturer’s provision of technical support for clinical validation or clinical applications, or solicitation of business from clinical laboratories, all of which could be considered evidence of intended uses that conflict with RUO labeling. Consequently, these Luminex products are labeled “For Research Use Only” and meet the intent of the RUO/IUO Guidance.
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988
    Laboratories that purchase certain of our products are subject to extensive regulation under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), which applies to all clinical laboratory testing performed on humans in the United States (with the exception of clinical trials and basic research). A clinical laboratory is defined by CLIA as any facility that performs laboratory testing on specimens obtained from humans for the purpose of providing information for health assessment or for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease. CLIA requires laboratories to meet specified standards in areas such as personnel qualifications, administration, participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance and inspections. Certification through the CLIA program is generally a prerequisite to be eligible to bill state and federal health care programs, as well as many private insurers, for laboratory testing services. As a condition of CLIA certification, laboratories are subject to survey and inspection every other year, in addition to being subject to additional random inspections. The biennial survey is conducted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), a CMS agent (typically a state agency), or a CMS‑approved accreditation organization. High complexity, CLIA-certified laboratories frequently develop testing procedures to provide diagnostic results to customers.
     These tests have been traditionally offered by nearly all complex laboratories for the last few decades as LDTs, which are subject to CMS oversight through its enforcement of CLIA. The FDA also has claimed that it has regulatory authority over LDTs, but has not exercised enforcement with respect to most LDTs offered by high complexity laboratories, and has not sought to require these laboratories to comply with FDA regulations regarding medical devices. During 2010, the FDA publicly announced that it had decided to exercise regulatory authority over these LDTs, and that it planned to issue guidance to the industry regarding its regulatory approach. At that time, the FDA indicated that it would use a risk-based approach to regulation and would direct more resources to tests with wider distribution and with the highest risk of injury, but that it would be sensitive to the need to not adversely impact patient care or innovation. In September 2014, the FDA announced its framework and timetable for implementing this guidance. On November 18, 2016, the FDA announced it would not release final guidance at that time and instead would continue to work with stakeholders, the new administration and Congress to determine the right approach. On January 3, 2017, the FDA released a discussion paper outlining a possible risk-based approach for FDA and CMS oversight of LDTs. Later in 2017, the FDA indicated that Congress should enact legislation to address improved oversight of diagnostics, including LDTs, rather than the FDA addressing the issue through administrative proposals. Several legislative proposals have been described in separate bills (including, for example, the Diagnostic Accuracy and Innovation Act (DAIA) in 2017 and the Verifying Accurate, Leading-edge IVCT Development (VALID) Act in 2018), but none of these legislative approaches have been enacted. We cannot predict the ultimate timing or form of any such guidance or regulation or their potential impact. If adopted, such a regulatory approach by the FDA may lead to an increased regulatory burden, including additional costs and delays in introducing new tests. While the ultimate impact of the FDA’s approach is unknown, it may be extensive and may result in significant change.
Radiological Health Regulations
    Certain of our instruments use lasers to detect assay results. Therefore, we are required to ensure that these products comply with FDA regulations pertaining to the performance of laser products. The Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act, administered by the FDA, imposes performance standards and record keeping, reporting, product testing and product labeling requirements for devices that emit radiation. These regulations are intended to ensure the safety of laser products by establishing standards to prevent exposure to excessive levels of laser radiation. There can be no assurance that the FDA will agree with our interpretation and implementation of these regulations.
Foreign Jurisdictions
    Our products are also subject to certification or approval and regulation by foreign regulatory, safety agencies and notified bodies. For example, the EU has adopted the In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (IVDR), which is scheduled to go into effect on May 26, 2022. This new regulation will impose stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of in vitro diagnostic medical devices, including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance. As of now, manufacturers of currently approved in vitro diagnostic medical devices will have until May 26, 2022 to meet the IVDR. Complying with the requirements of this regulation may require us to incur significant expenditures. Failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to the EU requirements. 
 Medical device laws and regulations are also in effect in many countries outside of the United States, ranging from comprehensive pre-approval or pre-certification requirements for medical products, to simpler requests for product data or certification. The number and scope of these requirements is increasing. There can be no assurance that we, and our strategic partners, will be able to obtain any approvals that may be required to market xMAP or other technology products outside the United States. In addition, we may incur significant initial and/or ongoing costs in obtaining or maintaining our foreign regulatory approvals or certifications. Further, the export by us of products that have not yet been cleared for domestic commercial distribution is subject to FDA and other export requirements and/or restrictions.
    We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, or administrative or other penalties, and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future government contracts and programs.
    We produce CE marked products, which are subject to a number of different EU Directives, including, but not limited to, the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive 98/79/EC (IVDD). CE marking of our products is currently by self-assessment based on the intended uses of our products. There is currently no need for intervention in the assessment process by a notified body. A product that is not CE marked is non-compliant with applicable EU rules. Enforcement is ensured through market surveillance by the competent authorities of the EEA Member States. Imported products into the EU are checked for compliance at customs offices. 
EU Regulation of Medical Devices
As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the Essential Requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use and that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device (e.g., product labeling and instructions for use) are supported by suitable evidence. This assessment must be based on clinical data, which can be obtained from results of domestic and foreign clinical trials, in vivo efficacy data from animal models, in vitro data, as well as the quality and quantity of the available evidence. The conduct of clinical studies in the EEA is governed by detailed regulatory obligations. These may include the requirement of prior authorization by the Competent Authorities of the country in which the study takes place and the requirement to obtain a positive opinion from a competent Ethics Committee. This process can be expensive and time-consuming. 
On May 26, 2021, the current EU legislation applicable to medical devices is scheduled to be replaced by the Medical Device Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/745) (MDR). 
EU Regulation of In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices
In the EEA, in vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVDs) are regulated under the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive 98/79/EC (the IVDD). IVD manufacturers are required to comply with the Essential Requirements laid down in Annex I to the IVDD. Compliance with these requirements entitles manufacturers to affix the CE mark on products, without which they cannot be placed on the EU market. To demonstrate compliance with the Essential Requirements laid down in Annex I to the IVDD and obtain the right to affix the CE mark, IVD manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of IVDs. The IVDD groups IVDs into four categories based on the risks associated with relative dangers to public health and / or patient treatment by an IVD failing to perform as intended:
•General IVDs;
•IVDs for self-testing;
•IVDs falling within the scope of Annex II, List A; 
•IVDs falling within the scope of Annex II, List B.
 Following determination of the appropriate category for an IVD, manufacturers are required to follow the related conformity assessment procedures laid down in Article 9 of the IVDD.
 For general IVDs, a self-assessment process in accordance with Annex III of the IVDD and a related Declaration of Conformity by the manufacturer prior to affixing the CE mark is sufficient. In the Declaration of Conformity, the manufacturer certifies that its product complies with the Essential Requirements provided for in Annex I to the IVDD.

For IVDs for self-testing and those falling within List A or B of Annex II to the IVD, a notified body must undertake an assessment of the conformity of the manufacturer and/or the device with the applicable provisions of the IVDD.
 The notified body will commonly audit and examine a product's Technical File and the quality management system for the manufacture, design, and final inspection of a medical device before issuing a CE Certificate of Conformity demonstrating compliance with the requirements of the IVDD. Following the issuance of a CE Certificate of Conformity, manufacturers can draw up the Declaration of Conformity and affix the CE mark to the products covered by the CE Certificate of Conformity and the Declaration of Conformity.
 CE marking of our products is currently by self-assessment, not issued by a third party, based on the intended uses of our products. The involvement of a notified body during the conformity assessment procedure is not, therefore, currently required. This situation may, however, change with the new Regulation on In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices (IVDR), which are scheduled to go into effect May 26, 2022. The Regulation, which will replace the previous IVDD, will substantially impact IVD manufacturers.
 There can be no assurance that the Competent Authorities of the EEA Member States will agree with our interpretation and implementation of these regulations as it pertains to classification of our products. The failure by us or our strategic partners to comply with the IVDD could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
Regulation of our products in China
 The State Food and Drug Administration, P.R. China (SFDA), is the government regulation authority in charge of safety management of drug, food, health food and cosmetics for the People’s Republic of China. The SFDA issues certificates that are required for registration and approval to import our products into China. Certificates are also subject to periodic recertification requirements. We have received certificates for the “Luminex System,” which combines the Luminex 100 and Luminex 200 into one product, and for our MAGPIX System.
 Failure by us, or our strategic partners, to comply with applicable current federal, state and foreign medical product laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business. Federal, state and foreign regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of medical devices and components of such devices are continually subject to future changes. We cannot predict what impact, if any, such changes might have on our business, but any such changes could have a material impact.
WEEE
Directive 2012/19/EU on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE Directive) outlines the responsibility for the disposal of waste electrical and electronic equipment. Compliance with the WEEE Directive is placed with the manufacturers of such equipment. Those manufacturers are required to establish an infrastructure for collecting WEEE, in such a way that users of electrical and electronic equipment from private households should have the ability of returning WEEE at least free of charge. All Luminex-manufactured equipment is in compliance with this directive. Since August 13, 2005, we have been in compliance with the requirements regarding the labeling and disposal of our products containing electronic devices in each of the EEA Member States where our regulated products are distributed.
RoHS
Directive 2011/65/EU on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (RoHS Directive) restricts the placing on the EU market of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) containing specific hazardous substances in quantities above the maximum concentrations specified in Annex II to the RoHS Directive. Restricted substances include lead, cadmium, mercury, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyl (PBB) and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE). Maximum concentration levels have also been set for Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), Butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), Dibutyl phthalate (DBP), Diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP) following Commission Delegated Directive (EU) 2015/863 of 31 March 2015 amending Annex II to Directive 2011/65/EU as regards the list of restricted substances The restriction of DEHP, BBP, DBP and DIBP will be applicable to in vitro medical devices from July 22, 2021. 
 The Directive directly affects manufacturers, importers and distributors of EEE placing their products on the EEA market. The Directive applies to EEE falling within the categories set out in Annex I to the RoHS Directive, including medical devices and IVDs. Manufacturers of EEE are required to comply with the requirements set out in Article 4 of the RoHS. Article 4 of the RoHS Directive restricts the presence of substances referred to in Annex II to the RoHS Directive above the maximum concentrations detailed for each substance in Annex II to the RoHS Directive in EEE. Exemptions for applications are provided in Annex III to the RoHS Directive. Further exemptions for specific applications to medical devices and monitoring and control instruments are set out in Annex IV to the RoHS Directive.
In the EEA, EEE manufacturers must comply with the requirements of Article 4 of the RoHS Directive. Compliance with these requirements entitles manufacturers to affix the CE mark on products, without which they cannot be placed on the EU market. To demonstrate compliance with the requirements of Article 4 of the RoHS Directive and obtain the right to affix the CE mark on products, manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure. For EEE, a self-assessment process in accordance with module A of Annex II to Decision No 768/2008/EC and a related Declaration of Conformity by the manufacturer prior to affixing the CE mark is sufficient. In the Declaration of Conformity, the manufacturer certifies that its product complies with the requirements of Article 4 of the RoHS Directive.
If the EEE also falls under other EU legislation requiring the application of a conformity assessment procedure which is at least as stringent, compliance with the requirements of Article 4 of the RoHS Directive may be demonstrated within the context of that procedure and a single technical documentation may be drawn up.
Environmental
    We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment. In the course of our business, we are involved in the handling, storage and disposal of certain chemicals and biohazards. The laws and regulations applicable to our operations include provisions that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. Some of these environmental laws and regulations impose “strict liability,” rendering a party liable without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such party. Such environmental laws and regulations may expose us to liability for environmental contamination, including remediation costs, natural resource damages and other damages as a result of the conduct of, or conditions caused by, us or others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed. In addition, where contamination may be present, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury, property damage and recovery of response costs. Although it is our policy to use generally accepted operating and disposal practices in accordance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, hazardous substances or wastes may have been disposed or released on, under or from properties owned, leased or operated by us or on, under or from other locations where such substances or wastes have been taken for disposal. These properties may be subject to investigation, remediation and monitoring requirements under federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. However, failure to comply with these environmental laws and regulations may result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties or other liabilities. We do not believe that we have been required to expend material amounts in connection with our efforts to comply with environmental requirements or that compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position. Because the requirements imposed by such laws and regulations may frequently change and new environmental laws and regulations may be adopted, we are unable to predict the cost of compliance with such requirements in the future, or the effect of such laws on our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position. Moreover, the modification or interpretation of existing environmental laws or regulations, the more vigorous enforcement of existing environmental laws or regulations or the adoption of new environmental laws or regulations may also negatively impact our strategic partners, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us and other similarly situated component companies.
Other Government Regulations
    Our operations in the United States are subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018, and state and federal marketing compliance laws. These laws may impact our operations directly or indirectly through our customers and may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to or impacted by patient and consumer privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. We are also subject to statutes in foreign jurisdictions that prohibit commercial bribery and certain activities with customers or potential customers. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include the following foreign laws, federal laws and their counterparts at the state level in addition to various implementing regulations:
•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and state anti-kickback prohibitions; 
•the federal physician self-referral prohibition, commonly known as the Stark Law, and state equivalents; 
•the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and implementing privacy, security and breach notification regulations, and similar state laws;
•the Civil Monetary Penalties Law and related exclusion provisions; 
•the federal False Claims Act and state equivalents; 
•the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010;
•the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which applies to our international activities; and 
•the Physician Payment Sunshine Act. 
The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data security continues to evolve. There has been increased attention to privacy and data security issues that could potentially affect our business, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which entered into effect on May 25, 2018 and imposes penalties up to 4% of annual global turnover. In addition, laws and regulations enacted in the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America, including the new California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which went into effect January 1, 2020, increases potential enforcement and litigation activity. 
In the event we enroll subjects in our ongoing or future clinical investigations in the EEA, we may be subject to additional privacy restrictions, including restrictions relating to the collection, use, storage, transfer, and other processing of personal data, including personal health data, regarding individuals in the European Economic Area as governed by the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. The GDPR imposes several requirements on companies that process personal data, strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Economic Area, including to the U.S and fines and penalties for failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EU Member States. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. The obligations under the GDPR may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation, and reputational harm in connection with any European activities. Furthermore, the United Kingdom’s exit of the EU, often referred to as Brexit, has created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the United Kingdom. In particular, it is unclear how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated.
Because of the remote work policies we implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic, information that is normally protected, including company confidential information, may be less secure. Cybersecurity and data security threats continue to evolve and raise the risk of an incident that could affect our operations or compromise our business information or sensitive personal information, including health data.
We may also need to collect more extensive health-related information from our employees to manage our workforce. If we or our third-party partners fail to comply or are alleged to have failed to comply with applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations, and related employment rules, or if we were to experience a data breach involving personal information, we could be subject to government enforcement actions or private lawsuits.
In addition, our business could be adversely impacted if our ability to transfer personal data outside of the EEA or Switzerland is restricted, which could adversely impact our operating results. For example, in July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union, or the Court of Justice, declared the Privacy Shield Decision (Decision 2018/1250) invalid, which could adversely impact our ability to transfer personal data from the EU to the U.S. The Court of Justice further ruled that in order to transfer data outside of the EU, under the existing mechanism known as the Standard Contractual Clauses, or SCCs, the importing country’s level of protection must be adequate.
On September 8, 2020, the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner, or FDPIC, of Switzerland issued an opinion concluding that the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework does not provide an adequate level of protection for data transfers from Switzerland to the United States. The FDPIC also found that SCCs may still be legally adequate at an individual level, provided that they can pass a risk assessment conducted by the FDPIC. If the level of protection in the U.S. or any other importing country is called into question under the SCCs, this could further impact our ability to transfer data outside of the EU or Switzerland.
Health Care Reform 
    Over the last decade, the U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have introduced and passed a large number of laws and regulations designed to make major changes in the healthcare system, including changes intended to increase access to health insurance. The most prominent of these efforts, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Affordable Care Act), has resulted in extensive changes across the healthcare system and affects how healthcare services are covered, delivered and reimbursed. However, there is substantial uncertainty regarding the future of the Affordable Care Act. The law has been subject to legislative and regulatory changes and court challenges, and certain members of Congress have expressed their intent to repeal or make significant changes to the Affordable Care Act, its implementation or its interpretation. Effective January 2019, Congress eliminated the financial penalty associated with the individual mandate to maintain health insurance coverage. As a result of this change, a federal court in Texas ruled that the individual mandate was unconstitutional, and determined that the rest of the law was, therefore, invalid. In December 2019, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld this decision with respect to the individual mandate, but remanded for further consideration of how this affects the rest of the law. The law remains in place pending appeal. It is possible that the Affordable Care Act, uncertainty regarding its repeal, the ultimate outcome and impact of court challenges, significant changes to the law or other health reform efforts, such as single-payor proposals, will adversely affect our customers and strategic partners, which could cause them to reduce or delay the purchase of our systems or to demand reduced fees.
Human Capital Management
Our People
We believe that our talented workforce and culture of collaboration is one of our key strengths and that our continued success is built on the empowerment of our employees to develop and deliver reliable products for the diagnostic and life science industries we serve. As a global company in a highly competitive industry, we have designed our human capital strategy, including our employee compensation programs, to attract, develop, engage and retain talented employees who will allow us to continue to deliver on our business strategy. 
As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 1,325 team members in 18 countries. 1,058 of our team members are employed in the United States and the remaining 267 are employed in foreign countries, primarily in Canada, China, Japan, The Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom. Nearly 90% of our team members work full time, while approximately 7% are limited assignment team members who work primarily in our manufacturing facilities. Less than 5% are part-time workers. In 2020 we classified less than 5% of our turnover as “regrettable,” which is the classification term we use generally to describe an employee who voluntarily resigns without any associated disciplinary or performance issues pending. None of our team members in the United States are subject to collective bargaining agreements. 
Culture of Inclusion 
Creating a culture where all colleagues feel supported and valued is paramount to our corporate values. We encourage all of our team members to bring their entire self to Luminex and to feel valued for the distinct contributions they bring to the growth of our business. As a global company, we embrace diversity and collaboration in our workforce and in how we operate. Our talent strategy is focused on attracting the best diverse talent, as well as developing and rewarding our team members' performance to increase retention and performance. We are an affirmative action employer and in addition to our focus on diversity, we prioritize the hiring of our veterans and seek out ways to provide opportunities for our disabled team members. Our recruiters are trained in diversity sourcing strategies and partner with external organizations that develop and supply diverse talent. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 40% of our workforce self-identified as female and approximately 35% of our workforce self-identified as racial minorities. The average age of our team members is forty-two and 21% of our workforce are managers. 
In addition to our focus in hiring, we seek to foster a diverse and inclusive workplace that encourages engagement and development of our team members and drives retention. We provide diversity and inclusion training for leaders across our organization and utilize Employee Resource Groups (“ERG”) programs, which are staffed by volunteer team members with diverse backgrounds, experiences, or characteristics who share a common interest in professional development, improving corporate culture and delivering sustained business results. 
We currently have four ERGs:
1.xTreme Team, which promotes and organizes events to keep all team members engaged with Luminex and keep it a fun environment where employees want to be part of a great team; 
2.Women@Luminex, which focuses on the growth and development of our female team members by providing educational opportunities, mentoring programs and other activities to provide growth and development of our talented women and to encourage community development for women and girls to choose a career in life sciences;
3.Diversity Council, which embraces the diversity and inclusion of our team members, customers, partners and stakeholders, including their unique backgrounds, experiences, thoughts and talents; and 
4.Community Involvement Committee, which promotes our commitment to corporate social responsibility and improving the world for current and future generations, as well as our collective values rooted in trust, respect, innovation and execution. 
We believe that our rich culture of diversity and inclusion and our continuous focus on developing and training our global workforce, enable us to create, develop and fully leverage the strengths of our workforce to exceed customer expectations. 
Compensation 
The primary objective of our compensation programs, which we design with oversight from senior management and the compensation committee of our board of directors, as appropriate, is to provide incentives that attract, retain, motivate and reward superior performance by team members who must perform in a highly competitive and technologically challenging environment. The compensation programs for our team members align with the compensation programs for our executives, which the compensation committee of our board of directors reviews annually. We seek to identify top talent and then provide incentives for these talented team members to grow their careers with us. We review total compensation and benefits with reference to both external comparisons and internal comparisons and believe that our compensation programs support our corporate strategic priorities and align our team members’ economic interests with those of our stockholders. We base annual changes in compensation on our overall performance, as well as each individual’s contribution to the results achieved, and we grant equity awards, not only to our executives but also to our key team members and certain top performers. Annual bonus decisions are significantly tied to our overall achievement of financial goals and key development projects so that our employees’ incentives track our performance and align with our key business priorities. We believe that our compensation programs encourage an innovative, collaborative working environment and incentivize our team members to drive our overall success.
Compliance and Ethics
Compliance and ethics are deeply embedded in our values and business processes. Our compliance programs are designed around global standards with appropriate variations addressing the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate. We strive to create a culture of compliance for every team member, with a responsibility to always “do the right thing.” We have a Code of Compliance that applies to all of the team members, officers and directors and regularly conduct compliance and regulatory training at all of our locations. We also maintain an ethics reporting hotline for both team members and customers to provide any compliance, regulatory or discrimination concerns. We believe that fostering a workforce committed to compliance and ethics is an important part of our overall success.
Wellness and Safety
We strive to ensure the health, safety and general well-being of all of our team members. We maintain a safety environment that seeks to eliminate workplace incidents, risk, hazards and transmission of any illnesses. We also continue to evolve our programs to meet our team members’ health and wellness needs, which we believe is essential to attract and retain high-caliber employees. In addition, as we have sought to manage the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our workforce, we have undertaken a number of new initiatives, including working remotely when possible, increasing the amount of communication from senior management, providing mental health programs and online training for our remote employees and offering COVID-19 and serology testing to our manufacturing and R&D team members and their support organizations who must physically report to the office. 
We also monitor the overall engagement of our team members with the use of on-boarding surveys and recently implemented a new tool to allow more frequent surveys to measure the morale and ongoing concerns of our team members. We understand that the work environment has changed because of the COVID-19 pandemic and are committed to working in tandem with our leaders and team members to assess how the shifts brought on by the pandemic may change our flexible working policies in the future. 
Seasonality
    Worldwide sales, including U.S. sales, do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, sales of our Respiratory Viral products have demonstrated seasonal fluctuations consistent with the onset and decline of influenza-like illnesses.
