Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing small molecule therapeutics targeting fundamental biological pathways of cancers. We use our highly efficient drug discovery engine, which we refer to as our Integrated Discovery Engine, to identify targets and develop small molecule new chemical entities, or NCEs, with properties that we believe could result in potentially differentiated product profiles. Our discovery engine combines our extensive experience and capabilities across cancer biology and medicinal chemistry. We believe our product candidates are differentiated from current programs targeting similar pathways and, if approved, have the potential to significantly impact clinical outcomes of patients with cancer.
We are developing a broad pipeline of product candidates, with an initial focus on validated oncology targets with the potential to address large patient populations. We currently have two (2) lead product candidates - ZN-c5 and ZN-c3. ZN-c5 is an oral selective estrogen receptor degrader, or SERD, currently in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the treatment of advanced estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, or ER+/HER2-, advanced or metastatic breast cancer. We have designed ZN-c5 to have high potency and selectivity, as well as favorable tolerability and pharmacokinetic, or PK, properties. We intend to initiate the Phase 2 monotherapy and combination portions of this Phase 1/2 trial in the first half of 2021. ZN-c3, an inhibitor of WEE1, a protein tyrosine kinase, is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the treatment of advanced solid tumors as a monotherapy and in a Phase 1b clinical trial in combination with chemotherapy in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. We plan to present initial data from the Phase 1 portion of the Phase 1/2 monotherapy trial at the 2021 American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting. In 2021, we intend to initiate a Phase 2 monotherapy trial for uterine serous carcinoma, or USC, and two (2) additional Phase 1 clinical trials evaluating ZN-c3 in combination with chemotherapy and PARP inhibitor in ovarian cancer and other targeted indications.
Our other clinical product candidates include ZN-d5, a selective inhibitor of B-cell lymphoma 2, or BCL-2, currently in Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or NHL, and acute myelogenous leukemia, or AML, and ZN-e4, an irreversible inhibitor of mutant epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR, currently in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC. 
We plan to explore the combination potential of ZN-c5, our oral SERD, with ZN-d5, our BCL-2 inhibitor, for the treatment of ER+/HER2- breast cancer. We expect to report topline results from the Phase 1 portion of the ongoing trials of each of ZN-c5, ZN-c3 and ZN-e4 in 2021. We currently own worldwide development and commercialization rights to each of our product candidates, other than in select Asian countries (including China) for each of ZN-c5, ZN-c3 and ZN-d5, for which we have out-licensed these rights to our majority-owned joint venture, Zentera Therapeutics (Cayman), Ltd., or Zentera, and for ZN-e4, for which we have out-licensed these rights to SciClone Pharmaceuticals International (Cayman) Development Ltd., or SciClone.
The following table summarizes our product candidate pipeline.
(1) We are currently evaluating ZN-c5 in combination with palbociclib, as part of a clinical research collaboration with Pfizer, and are evaluating ZN-c5 in combination with abemaciclib, as part of a clinical research collaboration with Eli Lilly and Company, or Lilly. We maintain full ownership of ZN-c5 in each such collaboration. SciClone has development and commercial rights to ZN-e4 in Greater China (including Macau and Hong Kong), South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Zentera, our majority-owned joint venture, has development and commercial rights to ZN-c5, ZN-c3 and ZN-d5 in select Asian countries (including China). Zentera submitted an investigational new drug application, or IND, in China for ZN-c5 in December 2020, for ZN-c3 in February 2021, and intends to submit for ZN-d5 in 2021. 
We are also currently advancing multiple small molecule programs in preclinical development for other cancer indications, including select solid tumors and hematological malignancies. We are now in lead optimization for our fifth product candidate and plan to submit an IND to the FDA in 2021.
In the six (6) years since our inception, we have successfully cleared four (4) INDs with the FDA, and expect to submit a fifth IND in 2021. Our Integrated Discovery Engine has enabled us to take each of our clinical-stage product candidates from initial discovery to IND submission in less than three (3) years in a capital efficient manner. We begin our process of drug discovery by identifying fundamental biological pathways of cancers based upon a number of factors, including validation of the pathway through prior clinical outcomes and ability to impact large patient populations. We then analyze existing marketed products and compounds in development that target these cancer pathways and assess their limitations, efficacy, safety, tolerability, PK, patient convenience and potential to be used in combination with other therapies. Next, we use our medicinal chemistry expertise and extensive understanding of target-drug structure activity to design proprietary NCEs with properties that we believe can address observed limitations and suboptimal drug characteristics of marketed products or other compounds in development, including potency, solubility, route of administration and PK properties. We believe overcoming these limitations may also allow us to develop these product candidates for use in combination with other therapies, including with our internally-developed product candidates, if approved. Finally, we strive to generate preclinical data to support that such candidates could have a differentiated product profile in our expected lead indications before advancing a compound into clinical development. We have used our Integrated Discovery Engine to generate a pipeline of four (4) product candidates targeting solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Longer term, we believe our discovery engine has the potential to generate product candidates addressing a wide range of additional therapeutic areas.
ZN-c5, one of our lead product candidates, is an oral SERD for the treatment of ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer. ER+/HER2- breast cancer affects approximately 70% of all breast cancer patients in the United States. These tumors depend on the estrogen receptor, or ER, for growth and survival, and are currently treated by a number of approved hormonal therapies. We have designed ZN-c5 to overcome limitations of existing hormonal therapies, including the only FDA-approved SERD, fulvestrant (marketed as Faslodex® by AstraZeneca). Despite its limitations, Faslodex® generated worldwide sales of over $1.0 billion in 2018 (the last year prior to generic competition), reflecting part of the significant potential of the SERD therapeutic class in ER+/HER2- breast cancer.
We believe ZN-c5, which is being developed for convenient oral administration, has the potential to be used as monotherapy and in combinations, and could become the standard of care for hormonal therapy in the treatment of all lines of ER+/HER2- breast cancer, if approved. We are currently evaluating ZN-c5 in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer, both as monotherapy and in combination with palbociclib (marketed as Ibrance® by Pfizer) as part of a clinical research collaboration with Pfizer. Palbociclib is an inhibitor of cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6, or CDK4/6, and is FDA approved for ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients in combination with hormonal therapies, such as fulvestrant. In addition, we initiated a Phase 1b open label, multi-center trial evaluating ZN-c5 in combination with abemaciclib (marketed as Verzenio® by Lilly) in patients with ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in November 2020 as part of a clinical research collaboration with Lilly. Abemaciclib is a CDK4/6 inhibitor FDA approved for the treatment of HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients in combination with fulvestrant, aromatase inhibitors or as a single agent in certain patients with disease progression following treatment with prior endocrine therapy or chemotherapy regimens.
We believe ZN-c5, if approved, may have a potentially differentiated product profile. Based on results from our ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial as of the database cutoff date of June 30, 2020, the PK of ZN-c5, as monotherapy and in combination with palbociclib, was characterized by rapid absorption into the systemic circulation and high drug exposure levels. Six (6) of the 15 patients in the Phase 1, monotherapy dose escalation portion of the trial showed stable disease for 24 weeks, leading to a clinical benefit rate of 40% as of such date. In addition, ZN-c5 has been observed to be well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities reported. In preclinical studies, ZN-c5 has shown anti-tumor activity, potency and selectivity. We intend to initiate the Phase 2 monotherapy and combination portions of the Phase 1/2 trial in the first half of 2021. We are also currently dosing ZN-c5 in a Phase 1 Window of Opportunity study in patients with ER+/HER2- breast cancer scheduled to undergo surgical resection of the tumor or start neoadjuvant treatment. We expect to report topline results of the Window of Opportunity study in the first half of 2021. In addition, we intend to initiate, subject to feedback from the FDA, a Phase 2/3 clinical trial evaluating 
ZN-c5 in earlier stage breast cancer patients in 2021 and to initiate a Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating ZN-c5 in combination with ZN-d5, our BCL-2 inhibitor product candidate, in patients with ER+/HER2- breast cancer in 2021.
Our other lead product candidate, ZN-c3, is an oral, small molecule inhibitor of WEE1, a DNA damage response protein. The inhibition of WEE1 aims to allow sufficient DNA damage in cancer cells to cause them to undergo programmed cell death, or apoptosis, thereby preventing tumor growth and potentially causing tumor regression. There is currently no FDA-approved WEE1 inhibitor. We believe ZN-c3, if approved, may have broad applicability in a wide range of cancers as monotherapy and in combination, including with chemotherapy agents and other targeted therapies. Based on data from 22 patients dosed in the Phase 1 monotherapy dose escalation portion of our ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial as of the database cutoff date of June 19, 2020, ZN-c3 has been observed to be well tolerated with no dose limiting toxicities reported. We are currently conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ZN-c3 in patients with advanced solid tumors. We plan to report results from the Phase 1 portion of this trial at the AACR Annual Meeting in April 2021. In addition, we initiated a Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating ZN-c3 in combination with chemotherapy in patients with advanced ovarian cancer in October 2020 and plan to initiate a Phase 2 trial evaluating ZN-c3 as monotherapy in patients with uterine serous carcinoma, or USC, in 2021. USC comprises 10%, and has the highest mortality rate, of all endometrial cancers, with approximately 6,000 new cases and 4,500 deaths in the United States per year. We continue to actively evaluate other potential combinations for the future clinical development of ZN-c3, and intend to initiate two (2) additional Phase 1 clinical trials evaluating ZN-c3 in combination with chemotherapy and PARP inhibitor in ovarian cancer and other targeted indications in 2021.
ZN-d5 is our oral, small molecule inhibitor of BCL-2, a protein that is designed to inhibit programmed cell death. BCL-2 is a validated target in a wide variety of malignancies and we are initially developing ZN-d5 for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. In the third quarter of 2020, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of ZN-d5 in patients with NHL and AML. We intend to initiate a Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating ZN-d5 in combination with ZN-c5, our oral SERD product candidate, in patients with ER+/HER2- breast cancer in 2021.
ZN-e4 is our oral, small molecule product candidate being developed as an irreversible inhibitor of mutant EGFR. EGFR regulates a number of cellular functions, including cell proliferation and survival, and is a driver of tumor growth in certain cancers, including lung cancer. We have designed ZN-e4 to be highly selective against mutant EGFR. We are conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ZN-e4 in patients with advanced NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations and are currently evaluating potential combination therapies for future clinical development of ZN-e4. We expect to report topline results from the Phase 1 portion of the trial in 2021.
Pursuant to a collaboration and license agreement entered into in May 2020, we collaborate with Zentera, our majority-owned joint venture, on the development and commercialization of ZN-c5, ZN-c3 and ZN-d5 in select Asian countries (including China). Zentera submitted an IND in China for ZN-c5 in December 2020, for ZN-c3 in February 2021, and intends to submit for ZN-d5 in 2021. 
Our History and Team
We began operations in January 2015. We have assembled a management team of biopharmaceutical experts with extensive experience in building and operating organizations that develop and deliver innovative medicines to patients. Our management team has broad expertise and successful track records in drug discovery, clinical development, regulatory affairs, manufacturing and commercialization of cancer therapies, as well as in business and finance, through previous experiences at leading institutions including Aisling Capital, Array Biopharma, Bayer Healthcare, Celgene, CureVac AG, Eisai US, Goldman Sachs, IQVIA, Merck, Morgan Stanley, Novartis, Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Pfizer, PsiOxus Therapeutics and R-Pharm US.
We are guided by our board of directors, scientific advisory board and business advisory board. Our scientific advisory board works with our management team in planning, development and execution of scientific, clinical, and research and development initiatives and strategies, while our business advisory board works with our management team on business and operational initiatives and strategies. Our renowned scientific and business advisory boards are comprised of key scientific and clinical thought leaders in oncology: Stephen Ansell, M.D., Ph.D., Andrew Badley, M.D., Robert Glassman, M.D., Shaji Kumar, M.D., Anthony Letai, M.D., Ph.D., Ross Levine, M.D., Donald McDonnell, Ph.D., Chad Robins, M.B.A. and Kwok-Kin Wong, M.D., Ph.D. These individuals are associated with the following leading institutions: Adaptive Biotechnologies, Credit Suisse, Duke University, Harvard Medical School, Mayo Clinic, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and NYU Langone Health.
We believe our experienced and diverse team is well positioned to leverage our highly efficient Integrated Discovery Engine to identify targets and develop small molecule NCEs targeting fundamental biological pathways of cancers that are differentiated from existing marketed therapies by clinical performance, and to address large patient populations.
Strategy
Our goal is to become a leading oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company. Our strategy includes the following key components:

•Discover and develop differentiated small molecule NCEs that address large patient populations with cancer. We have leveraged our broad industry experience and know-how, and the guidance of our scientific and business advisory boards, to build our Integrated Discovery Engine. This engine integrates our extensive capabilities across cancer biology and medicinal chemistry. We use our Integrated Discovery Engine to identify validated and fundamental targets and develop small molecule NCEs that are differentiated from existing marketed therapies by clinical performance, and, if approved, could offer meaningful benefits for patients. In addition, in April 2020, we entered into a discovery platform agreement with Tavros Therapeutics, Inc., or Tavros, to apply Tavros’ functional genomic discovery platform to develop next generation targeted small molecule drug candidates, with an initial goal of expanding our oncology product candidate pipeline. In February 2021, we announced a strategic collaboration to leverage Tempus’ patient-derived organoid biological modeling platform to strengthen Zentalis’ discovery and research capabilities. Tempus’ proprietary platform has the ability to grow and recapitulate tumors both genetically and functionally, some of which can be used for DNA repair profiling and therapeutic sensitivity testing. In harnessing Tempus’ cutting-edge approach, the collaboration will initially aim to evaluate Zentalis’ WEE1 inhibitor, ZN-c3, and its DNA damage response pathway in genetically distinct patient populations. The platform will also be used to investigate additional novel targets of cancer pathways identified by Zentalis, as well as support the study of Zentalis’ current product candidates across various indications. Zentalis retains full ownership of its therapeutic candidates. We will continue to pursue other opportunities for new technologies to enhance the Zentalis approach.
•Rapidly advance the development of our lead product candidates, ZN-c5 (oral SERD) and ZN-c3 (WEE1 Inhibitor), toward regulatory approval. We have designed ZN-c5 to overcome limitations of existing hormonal therapies including fulvestrant, the only FDA-approved SERD. Based on data observed in our preclinical studies and results from our ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial, we believe ZN-c5, if approved, may have a differentiated product profile. We are evaluating ZN-c5 as a treatment of ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer. ER+/HER2- breast cancer affects approximately 70% of all breast cancer patients in the United States. We are currently evaluating ZN-c5 in an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with ER+/ HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer both as monotherapy and in combination with palbociclib and in an ongoing Phase 1 Window of Opportunity study in patients with ER+/HER2- breast cancer scheduled to undergo surgical resection of the tumor or start neoadjuvant treatment. We intend to initiate the Phase 2 monotherapy and combinations portions of the Phase 1/2 trial, and to report topline results of the Window of Opportunity study, in the first half of 2021. In addition, in November 2020, we initiated a Phase 1b open label, multi-center trial evaluating ZN-c5 in combination with abemaciclib in patients with ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer as part of a clinical research collaboration with Lilly. In 2021, we intend to initiate a Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating ZN-c5 in combination with ZN-d5, our BCL-2 inhibitor product candidate, in patients with ER+/HER2- breast cancer, and, subject to feedback from the FDA, a Phase 2/3 clinical trial evaluating ZN-c5 in earlier stage breast cancer patients.We are currently evaluating ZN-c3 in a Phase 1/2 monotherapy clinical trial for the treatment of advanced solid tumors and in a Phase 1b clinical trial in combination with chemotherapy in advanced ovarian cancer. We plan to report initial topline results from the ongoing clinical trials of ZN-c3 at the 2021 American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting. In 2021, we intend to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating ZN-c3 as monotherapy in patients with USC, and two (2) additional Phase 1 clinical trials evaluating ZN-c3 in combination with chemotherapy and PARP inhibitor in ovarian cancer and other targeted indications. 
•Advance our additional product candidates, ZN-d5 (BCL-2 Inhibitor) and ZN-e4 (EGFR Inhibitor), across multiple cancer indications. We are advancing the development of our other small molecule NCEs targeting fundamental biological cancer pathways. These product candidates are designed to be small molecule NCEs with differentiated product profiles. ZN-d5 is currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial in NHL and AML and ZN-e4 is currently in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the treatment of advanced NSCLC. We expect to report topline results from the Phase 1 portions of the ongoing clinical trials of ZN-e4 in 2021. We also intend to initiate a Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating ZN-d5 in combination with ZN-c5 in patients with ER+/HER2- breast cancer in 2021. 
•Continue to evaluate our product candidate pipeline in combination with internally discovered and third-party compounds. We believe the future of cancer treatment is to target multiple fundamental biological pathways through combination therapies. In our preclinical studies and clinical trials, our product candidates have shown the potential for combination with other approved and development- stage cancer therapies. For example, we are dosing ZN-c5, our oral SERD, in combination with palbociclib for the treatment of ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer and, in November 2020, we initiated a Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating ZN-c5 in combination with abemaciclib for the treatment of ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer. We also plan 
to explore other potential combinations for our product candidates with internally developed compounds. For example, we plan to explore the combination potential of ZN-d5, our BCL-2 inhibitor, with ZN-c5, our oral SERD, for the treatment of breast cancer.
•Deploy our highly efficient Integrated Discovery Engine to further expand our product candidate pipeline. Our robust product candidate pipeline is enabled by our highly efficient drug discovery engine, which we plan to continue to leverage to discover and develop additional differentiated small molecule NCEs for the treatment of cancer. In the six (6) years since our inception, we have successfully cleared four (4) INDs with the FDA and expect to submit a fifth IND in 2021. Our Integrated Discovery Engine has enabled us to take our clinical-stage product candidates from initial discovery to acceptance of IND in less than three (3) years per program and in a capital efficient manner. We are also currently advancing multiple small molecule programs in preclinical studies for other cancer indications, including select solid tumors and hematological malignancies.
•Evaluate strategic opportunities to accelerate development timelines and maximize the value of our product candidate pipeline. We currently own the worldwide development and commercial rights to each of our product candidates, other than in select Asian countries (including China) for each of ZN-c5, ZN-c3 and ZN-d5, for which we have outlicensed these rights to Zentera, our majority-owned joint venture, and for ZN-e4, for which we have out-licensed these rights to SciClone. We intend to evaluate additional collaborations that could maximize the value of our product candidate pipeline, either through the evaluation of our product candidates in combination with compounds owned by third-parties or through geographic collaborations outside of the United States that allow us to leverage the existing infrastructure of other companies.
Our Zentalis Approach
We have leveraged our extensive industry experience and know-how, and the guidance of our scientific advisory board, to build our Integrated Discovery Engine that integrates our extensive capabilities across cancer biology and medicinal chemistry. This engine enables us to identify targets for which small molecule NCEs with high potency, high exposure and other optimized drug properties could yield potentially differentiated product profiles. Our approach centers on utilizing our Integrated Discovery Engine to identify such targets and subsequently develop product candidates that address targets with large cancer patient populations. At the core of our Integrated Discovery Engine is our experienced and proven management team, as well as our renowned chemistry team that has over 150 years of combined discovery expertise and who have collectively brought 35 product candidates into clinical development, including 27 oncology product candidates. Due in large part to our Integrated Discovery Engine, we have four (4) active INDs with the FDA, and expect to submit a fifth IND in 2021.
Our Integrated Discovery Engine is executed through the following process:

•First, identify fundamental biological pathways of cancers, considering a number of factors, including prior clinical outcomes, input from our scientific and business advisory boards, large unmet medical need and market opportunity.
•Second, identify and analyze key products or compounds targeting these cancer pathways and assess their limitations, including with respect to efficacy, safety, tolerability, PK, patient convenience and their potential to be used in combination.
•Third, use our medicinal chemistry expertise and deep understanding of target-drug structure activity relationships to create proprietary NCEs that are designed to improve upon and address observed limitations of existing products or compounds.
•Fourth, generate strong preclinical data to support our view that such candidates could have potentially differentiated product profiles in our expected lead indications, if approved, before moving a compound into clinical development.
We have initially chosen to focus on targets that have been validated clinically and, in most cases, commercially. This provides us with a clear understanding of the indications we will target and endpoints that have been required for regulatory approval of products for these indications in the past, as well as the potential for clinical adoption and commercial success. This strategy has enabled us to begin our drug discovery and development process at an advanced state relative to where the process would otherwise begin in focusing on uncharacterized targets. We believe this ability provides us with an efficient path to identifying novel drug compounds and advancing them into clinical development in a capital efficient manner.
Our Product Candidates
ZN-c5, an Oral SERD for the Treatment of ER+/HER2- Breast Cancer
Overview
We are developing ZN-c5, an oral, small molecule product candidate targeting the ER, a key driver of tumor growth and survival in ER+/HER2- breast cancer. These tumors are currently treated by a number of hormonal therapies; however, in contrast to most ER binders that simply block or modulate ER activity, ZN-c5 is also designed to cause degradation of the ER. As such, ZN-c5 is known as a Selective ER Degrader, or SERD. Fulvestrant, marketed as Faslodex® by AstraZeneca, is currently the only FDA-approved SERD. While effective, fulvestrant is limited to its FDA-approved dosing regimen of two (2) painful 5 mL concomitant monthly intramuscular injections, thus restricting the level of ER degradation that can be induced in patients, which we believe limits its efficacy. We have applied our expertise to design ZN-c5 as an oral potent and selective SERD with characteristics which we believe may result in a differentiated product profile. We believe ZN-c5, if approved, has the potential to be used as monotherapy and in combinations and could become the standard of care for hormonal therapy in the treatment of all lines of ER+/HER2- breast cancer.
We are currently conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ZN-c5 in patients with ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer. ER+/HER2- breast cancer affects approximately 70% of all breast cancer patients in the United States. We continue to enroll patients and collect data for ZN-c5 administered as monotherapy and in combination with palbociclib as part of a clinical research collaboration with Pfizer. Palbociclib, marketed as Ibrance®, is a CDK4/6 inhibitor that is FDA approved for the treatment of ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with hormonal therapies, such as fulvestrant. In addition, in November 2020, we initiated a Phase 1b open label, multi-center trial evaluating ZN-c5 in combination with abemaciclib (marketed as Verzenio® by Lilly) in patients with ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer as part of a clinical research collaboration with Lilly. Abemaciclib is a CDK4/6 inhibitor FDA approved for the treatment of HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with fulvestrant, aromatase inhibitors or as a single agent in certain patients with disease progression following treatment with prior endocrine therapy or chemotherapy regimens. We maintain full ownership of ZN-c5 in each collaboration.
We intend to initiate the Phase 2 monotherapy and combination portions of the Phase 1/2 trial in the first half of 2021. We are also currently dosing ZN-c5 in a Phase 1 Window of Opportunity study in patients with ER+/HER2- breast cancer scheduled to undergo surgical resection of the tumor or start neoadjuvant treatment. We expect to report topline results of the Window of Opportunity study in the first half of 2021. In addition, we intend to initiate, subject to feedback from the FDA, a Phase 2/3 clinical trial evaluating ZN-c5 in earlier stage breast cancer patients in 2021 and to initiate a Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating ZN-c5 in combination with ZN-d5, our BCL-2 inhibitor product candidate, in patients with ER+/HER2- breast cancer in 2021.
Background on Breast Cancer and Current Treatments
Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in women, accounting for 30% of all female cancers and 13% of cancer-related deaths in the United States. The National Cancer Institute estimated that approximately 275,000 new cases of breast cancer would be diagnosed in the United States in 2020, and approximately 42,000 breast cancer patients would die of the disease.
Most breast cancer tumor growth is dependent on two (2) main protein receptors: estrogen receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Approximately 70% of breast cancers in the United States are ER+/HER2-, meaning that they express ER and not HER2, and therefore depend on estrogen signaling for tumor growth and survival. These ER+ tumors are sometimes referred to as hormone receptor positive, or HR+ tumors, and are currently treated using several approaches:

•by blocking receptor function with selective ER modulators, or SERMs;
•by blocking the synthesis of these hormones with aromatase inhibitors, or AIs; or
•by degrading, and thus potentially eliminating ER receptors with a drug in the SERD class.
AIs have demonstrated superior clinical benefit to SERMs, including tamoxifen, and SERDs have demonstrated superior clinical benefit to AIs.
FDA-Approved SERD, Fulvestrant, and its Limitations
Currently, fulvestrant is the only FDA-approved SERD. Fulvestrant is FDA-approved for first and second-line treatment for women with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer both as monotherapy and as combination therapy with a number of other drug classes. Fulvestrant has demonstrated improved efficacy relative to AIs. In a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in treatment of naïve advanced and metastatic breast cancer patients, treatment with 500 mg of fulvestrant resulted in median progression free survival, or PFS, of 16.6 months versus 13.8 months for anastrozole, an FDA-approved oral AI marketed as Arimidex® by ANI Pharmaceuticals. However, fulvestrant has a number of pharmacological characteristics that 
require it to be delivered via two (2) painful 5 mL concomitant monthly intramuscular injections, which we believe may limit its efficacy and tolerability. Despite these limitations, AstraZeneca reported worldwide sales of Faslodex® of over $1.0 billion in 2018, the last year prior to generic competition.
We believe the following limitations associated with fulvestrant create an opportunity to develop a SERD with a superior product profile:

•Route of administration. Fulvestrant is highly insoluble and must be given via painful intramuscular injection. Fulvestrant is dosed monthly following two (2) initial loading doses administered two (2) weeks apart, and can only be delivered via two (2) painful 5 mL concomitant monthly intramuscular injections.
•Capped efficacy in humans. Results of third-party clinical trials have shown that higher doses of fulvestrant increased ER degradation and efficacy. In a randomized Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating fulvestrant in 211 postmenopausal women with ER+ locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, 250 mg and 500 mg of fulvestrant achieved a mean change of 14% and 50% of ER degradation, respectively, in each case measured at week 4 from dosing. In addition, in a Phase 3 clinical trial, the 500 mg dose arm achieved a median overall survival of 26.4 months as compared to 22.3 months achieved in the 250 mg dose arm.
Mean Change in ER Expression Levels (Week 4)
In preclinical mouse models, administration of 200 mg/kg of fulvestrant showed meaningful anti-tumor activity. However, based on recent published scientific literature, the human equivalent of the 200 mg/ kg dose of fulvestrant results in exposure that is an estimated eight-fold higher than what is clinically achievable with the highest FDA-approved human dose (500 mg) of fulvestrant. Based on these clinical and preclinical data, we believe the overall efficacy that can be achieved with the administration of fulvestrant may be capped by the current FDA-approved dose.
•Convenience and resource utilization. The administration of fulvestrant as an intramuscular injection requires once monthly visits by patients to their health care providers, resulting in patient inconvenience and burden, such as time away from work. These injections also result in injection site pain, as well as bleeding complications in those patients with bleeding tendencies or anticoagulant use. In addition, significant injection related events such as sciatica, neuralgia, neuropathic pain, and peripheral neuropathy have been reported. Furthermore, we believe the combination of monthly intramuscular injections with a daily oral therapy, such as a CDK4/6 inhibitor, does not achieve optimal patient compliance.
SERD Use in Combination
Fulvestrant is FDA approved as a combination therapy with a number of other drug classes:

•CDK4/6 inhibitors. One common mechanism of resistance to fulvestrant is the activation of the CDK4/6 pathway. Fulvestrant administered in combination with oral CDK4/6 inhibitors has demonstrated improved clinical efficacy when compared with fulvestrant as monotherapy. In a randomized, double-blind clinical trial, treatment of HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer patients with a combination of fulvestrant and palbociclib demonstrated a median PFS of 9.5 months compared to 4.6 months for those patients dosed with fulvestrant as a single agent. These 
patients had previously progressed on or after prior endocrine therapy. Worldwide sales of currently marketed CDK4/6 inhibitors, which are indicated for the treatment of breast cancer, were $6.0 billion in 2019, and are expected to grow to $14.4 billion in 2026. Worldwide sales of Ibrance® were $5.0 billion in 2019 and are expected to grow to $9.7 billion in 2026.
•Phosphoinositide 3-kinase, or PI3K, inhibitors. Another common mechanism of resistance to fulvestrant is the activation of the PI3K pathway, an important intracellular pathway that regulates cell growth and metabolism. Approximately one third of HR+ breast cancer tumors resistant to endocrine therapy harbor activating mutations of the catalytic subunit of PI3K, referred to as PIK3CA. Fulvestrant used in combination with alpelisib, an oral PI3K inhibitor marketed as Piqray® by Novartis approved by the FDA in May 2019, has demonstrated improved clinical efficacy in patients whose tumors had a PIK3CA mutation. In a randomized, double-blind clinical trial, treatment of HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer patients with a PIK3CA mutation with a combination of fulvestrant and alpelisib led to a median PFS of 11.0 months compared to 5.7 months for those patients treated with fulvestrant as monotherapy. These patients had previously progressed on or after prior endocrine therapy. Worldwide sales of Piqray®, currently only FDA-approved for the treatment of breast cancer, were approximately $116.0 million in 2019 and are expected to grow to $1.4 billion in 2026.
Clinical data has also shown promising results from the use of fulvestrant with other targeted therapies:

•Mammalian target of rapamycin, or mTOR, inhibitors. Similar to CDK4/6 and PI3K, the mTOR pathway has also been identified as a mechanism of resistance to endocrine therapy. Everolimus is an mTOR inhibitor that is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer in combination with exemestane, an AI. Everolimus has also shown clinical benefit in combination with fulvestrant. In a randomized, double-blind clinical trial, treatment of HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer patients with a combination of fulvestrant and everolimus demonstrated a median PFS of 10.3 months compared to 5.1 months for those patients dosed with fulvestrant as monotherapy. These patients had previously progressed on or after prior AI therapy. Worldwide sales in breast cancer of everolimus, marketed as Afinitor® by Novartis and a leading mTOR inhibitor, were approximately $831.0 million in 2019.
Our SERD Solution: ZN-c5
We believe a conveniently administered oral SERD with superior efficacy could be indicated for monotherapy or in combinations and could become the standard of care for hormonal therapy in the treatment of all lines of ER+/HER2- breast cancer.
ZN-c5 is our oral SERD product candidate, which we believe has the potential to overcome limitations of existing hormonal therapies in the treatment of ER+/HER2- breast cancer due to the following observed preclinical and clinical results:

•Potency and selectivity. In our in vitro preclinical studies, we observed the potency of ZN-c5 as measured by proliferation inhibition and degradation of ERα, and that the combination of ZN-c5 and palbociclib was associated with meaningful shrinkage in MCF-7 tumors. In addition, ZN-c5 has exhibited no agonist activity in animal models which, if present, may compromise its anti-tumor activity.
•Preclinical anti-tumor activity. In preclinical studies, ZN-c5 demonstrated anti-tumor activity in multiple breast cancer cell lines, both as monotherapy and in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors and PI3Ka inhibitors, as well as superior tumor growth inhibition when compared to fulvestrant. In addition, in preclinical studies ZN-c5 demonstrated increased anti-tumor activity when administered in combination with BCL-2 inhibitors, including our BCL-2 inhibitor product candidate, ZN-d5, as compared to ZN-c5 as monotherapy.
•Preliminary Clinical Activity As of the database cutoff date of June 30, 2020, one patient in the Phase 1, monotherapy dose expansion portion of the Phase 1/2 trial at the 150 mg/day dose level had met the definition of a confirmed partial response, or PR, per RECISTv1.1 criteria after four (4) cycles of ZN-c5. In addition, as of such date, six (6) of the 15 patients in the Phase 1, monotherapy dose escalation portion of the trial showed stable disease, or SD, for at least 24 weeks leading to a clinical benefit rate, or CBR, of 40%. 
•PK characteristics. In preclinical and clinical studies to date, oral dosing of ZN-c5 has shown high exposure levels.
•Tolerability profile. In preclinical studies, ZN-c5 was well tolerated in one-month repeat dose toxicology studies. In addition, based on results from our Phase 1/2 clinical trial as of the database cutoff date of June 30, 2020, no dose-limiting toxicities have been reported.
•Safety profile. In clinical studies to date, ZN-c5 has demonstrated a favorable tolerability profile, which we believe may be an important differentiating factor for patients who require longer term dosing, particularly patients with earlier stage disease.
•Convenience of administration. ZN-c5 was designed to be a once-daily oral drug. If approved, we believe this would provide patient convenience and the potential for an all oral dosing regimen as monotherapy and in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors and other oral targeted therapies.
In our Phase 1/2 clinical trial, we are evaluating the potential of ZN-c5 as monotherapy and in combination with palbociclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, as part of a clinical development collaboration with Pfizer. In addition, we initiated a Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating ZN-c5 in combination with abemaciclib as part of a clinical collaboration with Lilly in November 2020, and we plan to initiate a Phase 2/3 clinical trial evaluating ZN-c5 in earlier stage breast cancer patients in 2021. We also intend to initiate a Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating ZN-c5 in combination with ZN-d5, our BCL-2 inhibitor product candidate, in patients with ER+/HER2- breast cancer in 2021.
Preclinical Results
Potency of ZN-c5 in Combination Therapy in MCF-7 Breast Cancer Xenograft Model
We have assessed the potency of the combination of ZN-c5 and palbociclib in mice with MCF-7 tumors. In this study, the tumors were initially grown to a large size of over 800 mm3, at which point treatment began on day 36. We observed that the combination of ZN-c5 and palbociclib, both dosed orally, led to the meaningful shrinkage of these tumors to a mean size of less than 200 mm3 by day 78, as shown in the graph below.
ER Degradation in MCF-7 Models
We assessed the potency of ZN-c5 and third-party hormonal therapies, fulvestrant and RAD1901, in repeat preclinical studies using MCF-7 breast cancer cells. RAD1901 is a SERM/SERD being evaluated by a third party in an ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial. As shown in the table below, ZN-c5 was observed to have good anti-proliferative activity and ERa degradation activity.

Assessment of Agonist Activity
In preclinical studies, we observed no difference in agonist activity of ZN-c5 when compared to vehicle in a standard Uterine Wet Weight (UWW) animal model which, if present, may otherwise compromise anti-tumor activity.
Anti-tumor Activity in MCF-7 Breast Cancer Xenograft Models
In a preclinical study, we assessed the anti-tumor activity of ZN-c5, alongside fulvestrant and palbociclib, in each case as monotherapy, in multiple breast cancer cell lines. ZN-c5 was also assessed in combination with palbociclib. As shown in the graph below, in a xenograft model using human MCF-7 breast cancer cells, we observed that ZN-c5 dosed at 1 mg/kg had more potent anti-tumor activity than 200 mg/kg of fulvestrant. Even greater anti-tumor activity was observed by either increasing the dose of ZN-c5 to 40 mg/kg or by combination therapy using 5 mg/kg of ZN-c5 and 50 mg/kg of palbociclib.

We also assessed the anti-tumor activity of ZN-c5, alongside fulvestrant and alpelisib, in each case as monotherapy, in preclinical models. ZN-c5 and fulvestrant were also assessed in combination with alpelisib. As shown in the graph below, in a xenograft model using human MCF-7 breast cancer cells, we observed that ZN-c5 dosed once daily at 1 mg/kg had more potent anti-tumor activity than 3 mg/dose of fulvestrant administered once per week over four (4) weeks. Even greater anti-tumor activity was observed with the combination of 1 mg/kg of ZN-c5 and 50 mg/kg of alpelisib. We also observed that the combination of ZN-c5 and alpelisib had more potent anti-tumor activity than the combination therapy using 3 mg/dose of fulvestrant and 50 mg/kg of alpelisib. In addition, the combination of ZN-c5 and alpelisib was associated with a body weight loss at the end of the study of 20.5% relative to baseline, compared to a body weight loss of 19% for alpelisib as monotherapy relative to baseline. The body weight loss at the end of the study for ZN-c5 as monotherapy was 7% relative to baseline.

Anti-Tumor Activity in Breast Cancer Resistance Model (ESR1)
In a preclinical study, we assessed anti-tumor activity of ZN-c5 as monotherapy and in combinations with palbociclib and abemaciclib in animal models using patient-derived tumors, referred to as PDX models. We also assessed the anti-tumor activity of palbociclib, abemaciclib and fulvestrant each as monotherapy in the same PDX models. In the WHIM20 model, tumors were established in mice from a tumor isolated from a patient with metastatic breast cancer. This tumor contained a mutation in the ESR1, the gene encoding the ER. These mutations are a common mechanism that drives resistance to therapy, with a prevalence of resistance that ranges from 11% to 39%. As shown in the graph below, ZN-c5 was observed to have anti-tumor activity at a concentration of 40 mg/kg as a single agent in this model. As monotherapy, ZN-c5 demonstrated improved anti-tumor activity compared with the fulvestrant dose that results in exposure that is an estimated eight-fold higher than what is clinically achievable with the highest FDA-approved human dose of fulvestrant. Further, tumor shrinkage was observed with doses of 40 mg/kg ZN-c5 in combination with 50 mg/kg palbociclib and in combination with 50 mg/kg abemaciclib.

Anti-Tumor Activity of ZN-c5 in Combination with BCL-2 Inhibitor in MCF-7 Breast Cancer Models
In preclinical studies, we assessed the anti-tumor activity of ZN-c5, both as monotherapy and in combination with ZN-d5, our BCL-2 inhibitor, as well as in combination with venetoclax. As shown in the graphs below, in MCF-7 breast cancer models, we observed that the combinations of ZN-c5 dosed at 10 mg/kg with venetoclax, dosed at 50 mg/kg, and ZN-d5, dosed at each of 50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg, had greater anti-tumor activity than 10 mg/kg of ZN-c5 as monotherapy.

PK Data Comparison in Mouse Model
We assessed the PK properties of ZN-c5 and select third-party hormonal therapies in clinical development in repeat preclinical mouse studies, as shown in the table below. Oral dosing of ZN-c5 resulted in peak concentrations, or Cmax, of 5,017 ng/mL. As shown below, ZN-c5 also had high overall drug exposure, or AUC, as measured by ng*hr/mL, and good oral bioavailability (F), which is the fraction of an oral administered drug that reaches systemic circulation

Toxicology Results
ZN-c5 was well tolerated in up to 28-day repeat dose toxicology studies and produced no evidence of diarrhea.
Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial of ZN-c5
Trial Design
In December 2018, we initiated enrollment in our Phase 1/2 open label, multi-center trial of ZN-c5 in patients with ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer, which we refer to as our ZN-c5-001 Trial, to assess the safety, tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics and anti-tumor activity of ZN-c5 as monotherapy and in combination with palbociclib. We plan to enroll a total of approximately 250 patients in the trial, which will be conducted at multiple sites in the United States and Europe.
The Phase 1 portion of our ZN-c5-001 Trial consists of: a monotherapy dose escalation study, a monotherapy expansion study and a combination dose escalation study evaluating ZN-c5 in combination with palbociclib. The Phase 2 portion will evaluate preliminary anti-tumor efficacy of ZN-c5 as monotherapy and in combination with palbociclib.
 Phase 1, Monotherapy Dose Escalation
The primary objective of the Phase 1, monotherapy dose escalation portion of this trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, and recommended Phase 2 dose, or RP2D. The secondary objectives include, among others, to assess the PK, safety and tolerability as well as preliminary efficacy of ZN-c5. In addition, biomarkers will be assessed based on availability of patients’ biopsies.
In the Phase 1, monotherapy dose escalation portion of this trial, ZN-c5 is being evaluated in up to 36 adult patients with ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer who are refractory to or intolerant of established cancer therapies, and who may have received up to two (2) prior chemotherapy regimens for advanced/metastatic breast cancer. ZN-c5 is being orally administered, either once or twice daily continuously at sequentially escalating doses starting with 50 mg/day and up to 1,200 mg/day, using a 28-day cycle.
Phase 1, Monotherapy Expansion
During the Phase 1, monotherapy dose escalation portion of the trial, up to 45 additional patients with ER+/ HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have received up to two (2) prior lines of endocrine therapy, and who have may have received at most one prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced/metastatic breast cancer, are expected to be enrolled onto one or more dose levels for the Phase 1, monotherapy expansion portion of this trial.
The primary objective of the Phase 1, monotherapy expansion portion of the trial will be to assess the safety and tolerability of ZN-c5 administered as monotherapy. Secondary objectives of the monotherapy expansion portion of this trial will include, among others, to assess the preliminary anti-tumor efficacy and characterize the PK of ZN-c5.
Phase 1, Combination Dose Escalation
We are also evaluating ZN-c5 in combination with palbociclib in the Phase 1, combination dose escalation portion of this trial in up to 40 adult patients with ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer who are refractory to or intolerant of established therapies known to provide clinical benefit for their malignancy, and who may have received at most one prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced metastatic breast cancer.
The primary objective of the Phase 1, combination dose escalation portion of the trial is to determine the MTD or RP2D for ZN-c5 when administered in combination with palbociclib. Secondary objectives include, among others, to assess the safety and tolerability of ZN-c5 in combination with palbociclib, to assess preliminary efficacy of ZN-c5 in combination with palbociclib and to characterize the individual PK of ZN-c5 and palbociclib when administered in combination.
The dose and schedule of palbociclib in the Phase 1, combination dose escalation portion of this trial will be the FDA-approved dose (125 mg/day), orally administered, once daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by seven (7) days off treatment.
Phase 2
Once the MTD or RP2D have been determined for ZN-c5 as monotherapy and in combination with palbociclib, we plan to initiate enrollment in the Phase 2 portion of the trial to assess preliminary anti-tumor efficacy for ZN-c5 as monotherapy and in combination with palbociclib. We expect to initiate the Phase 2 monotherapy and combination portions of this Phase 1/2 trial in the first half of 2021.
The Phase 2 monotherapy portion of this trial will assess ZN-c5 at the RP2D in up to 75 adult patients with ER+/HER2- advanced breast cancer who have received one or two (2) prior lines of endocrine therapy, and no prior chemotherapy for advanced metastatic breast cancer.
The Phase 2 combination portion of this trial will evaluate ZN-c5 in combination with palbociclib in up to 112 adult patients with ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer and who have received up to one prior line of endocrine therapy, and at most one prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced metastatic breast cancer.
The primary objective of the Phase 2 portion of this trial will be to determine preliminary anti-tumor efficacy for ZN-c5 when administered as monotherapy and in combination with palbociclib. The secondary objectives will include, among others, to assess the safety and tolerability of ZN-c5 as monotherapy and in combination with palbociclib, and to characterize the PK of ZN-c5 as monotherapy and to characterize the individual PK of ZN-c5 and palbociclib when given in combination.
Clinical Results
As of June 30, 2020, we had enrolled 15 patients in the Phase 1, monotherapy dose escalation portion of this trial, three patients each at the dose levels of 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg. All patients were female, with a median age of 57 years (range 51 to 89 years) and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, or ECOG, performance status, a measurement of a patient's level of functioning in terms of their ability to care for themself, daily activity, and physical ability, of 0 (n = 9) or 1 (n = 6). 
The median number of prior therapies for advanced disease was four (4) (range two (2) to eight (8)). Twelve of the 15 patients received prior treatment with fulvestrant. Of these 15 patients, one is still on treatment and 14 discontinued due to disease progression (n = 13) or physician decision (n = 1). Enrollment in the Phase 1, monotherapy dose escalation portion of this trial has been completed.
As of June 30, 2020, 14 patients were enrolled in the Phase 1, monotherapy expansion portion of this trial, 12 patients at the 150 mg dose and two (2) patients at the 300 mg dose. All patients were female, with a median age of 57 years (range 38 to 73) and an ECOG performance status of 0 (n = 3) or 1 (n = 11). The median number of prior therapies for advanced disease was one (range zero (0) to three (3)). Six (6) of the 14 patients received prior treatment with fulvestrant. Of these 14 patients, five (5) are still on treatment and nine (9) discontinued due to disease progression. Enrollment in the Phase 1, monotherapy expansion portion of this trial has been completed.
As of June 30, 2020, we had enrolled 15 patients in the Phase 1, combination dose escalation portion of this trial, three patients each at the ZN-c5 dose levels of 50 mg and150 mg, and nine (9) patients at 100 mg. 14 patients were female and one was male, with a median age of 65 years (range 51 to 79 years) and an ECOG performance status of 0 (n = 7), 1 (n = 7) or 2 (n = 1). The median number of prior therapies for advanced disease was one (range zero (0) to six (6)). Three (3) of the 15 patients received prior treatments with fulvestrant. Of these 15 patients, nine (9) are still on treatment and six (6) discontinued due to disease progression (n = 5) and physician decision (n = 1). Enrollment in the Phase 1, combination dose escalation portion of this trial is ongoing and a total of up to 40 patients may be enrolled.
Safety Results
Phase 1, Monotherapy Dose Escalation and Monotherapy Dose Expansion
Based on the results as of the database cutoff date of June 30, 2020 for the Phase 1, monotherapy dose escalation and monotherapy dose expansion portions of this trial, ZN-c5 has been observed to be well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities reported.
In the Phase 1 monotherapy dose escalation and monotherapy dose expansion portions of this trial, a total of 29 patients were enrolled and dosed, with data available in the electronic data capture system as of the June 30, 2020 database cutoff. Treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, occurred in 27 of the 29 patients. Nausea was observed in nine (9) patients; hyperglycemia in eight (8) patients; anemia, fatigue, hypertension and vomiting in six (6) patients each; headache in five (5) patients; cough, hot flush, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia and lymphocyte count decreased in four (4) patients each; alanine aminotransferase, or ALT, increased, arthralgia, back pain, diarrhea, dyspnea, musculoskeletal pain and pyrexia in three patients each and all other adverse events were observed in only one or two (2) patients each. In addition, there have been no reports of bradycardia or any other cardiac abnormalities. TEAEs of Grade 3 severity were single cases of hypertension, hypercalcemia, back pain, arthralgia, pyrexia, COVID-19, device related infection, musculoskeletal chest pain, and pain in extremity. None of the Grade 3 TEAEs were deemed related to ZN-c5. All other TEAEs were of Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity. The Grade 3 TEAEs of arthralgia, device related infection and COVID-19 were also reported as serious adverse events, all deemed unrelated to treatment. There were three serious adverse events reported; all deemed unrelated to treatment. There were no deaths reported. 
Investigator assessed treatment-related adverse events occurred in 16 of 29 patients. These treatment-related adverse events included nausea, hot flush and fatigue (n = 3), ALT increased (n = 2) and other single adverse events. All were of Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity.
Diarrhea, an adverse event of special interest, has been observed in three patients: one Grade 1 adverse event at 50 mg, which was deemed treatment-related; and one Grade 1 and one Grade 2 adverse event, each at 150 mg, neither of which was deemed treatment-related.
The first patient with ALT increased had the first dose of 50 mg of ZN-c5 on December 19, 2018. The patient entered the study with a Grade 1 ALT increased, which subsequently worsened to a Grade 2 ALT increased on February 13, 2019, 56 days after the first dose. On March 27, 2019, the patient was taken off treatment for disease progression, and at that time the Grade 2 ALT increased was still ongoing. The event was deemed related to ZN-c5. The second patient with ALT increased had the first dose of 300 mg of ZN-c5 on October 15, 2019. The patient developed Grade 1 ALT increased and Grade 1 aspartate aminotransferase, or AST, increased 84 days after the first dose, on January 6, 2020. Dosing was interrupted and the Grade 1 AST increased resolved on Day 91, and the Grade 1 ALT increased resolved on Day 98. The events were not deemed to be related to ZN-c5. The third patient with ALT increased had the first dose of 150 mg of ZN-c5 on December 18, 2019. The patient entered the study with Grade 1 ALT increased and AST increased, but AST increased normalized on Day 8 and ALT increased normalized on Day 15. The patient again developed Grade 1 ALT increased and Grade 1 AST increased 58 days after the first dose, on February 13, 2020. Dosing was not interrupted. The AST increased normalized on Day 83, but fluctuated again to Grade 1 on Day 162. On June 3, 2020, the patient was taken off treatment for disease progression, and at that time both the Grade 1 ALT increased and AST increased were still ongoing. The event was deemed to be related to ZN-c5. 
Overall, in the Phase 1, monotherapy dose escalation and monotherapy dose expansion portions of the trial, there was no observed increase in severity of adverse events with increasing dosing levels.
Phase 1, Combination Dose Escalation
As of the June 30, 2020 database cutoff date, ZN-c5 in combination with palbociclib was observed to be well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities reported. Based on these safety results, we are continuing to enroll patients ZN-c5 in combination with palbociclib.
TEAEs occurred in 14 of the 15 patients dosed. Adverse events occurring in three or more patients included: white blood cell count decreased (n = 11); neutrophil count decreased (n = 9); anemia (n = 5), hyperglycemia, hypophosphatemia and nausea (n = 4); arthralgia, dizziness, fatigue, headache and platelet count decreased (n = 3). All other adverse events were observed in one or two (2) patients each. TEAEs of Grade 3 severity were neutrophil count decreased (n = 5), white blood cell count decreased (n = 3), arthralgia (n = 2) and single cases of each of hypophosphatemia, pneumothorax and pain in extremity. There was one serious adverse events of Grade 3 pneumothorax reported, deemed not related to ZN-c5 nor palbociclib.
Investigator assessed treatment-related adverse events to either ZN-c5 or palbociclib occurred in 13 of 15 patients. These investigator assessed treatment-related adverse events included: white blood cell count decreased (n = 11), neutrophil count decreased (n = 9), anemia (n = 5), fatigue (n = 3), platelet count decreased (n = 3), lymphocyte count decreased (n = 2) and 
other single adverse events. Events of Grade 3 severity were neutrophil count decreased (n = 3), and white blood cell count decreased (n = 5). Of note, there has been no evidence of any TEAEs of diarrhea bradycardia or visual disturbances. There were no deaths reported.
Overall, as of the June 30, 2020 database cutoff date, there was no increase in severity of adverse events observed with increasing dosing levels.
Efficacy Results
Clinical activity in the Phase 1 trial is determined by the CBR, which is the total number or percentage of patients who achieved a complete response, or CR, partial response, or PR, or stable disease, or SD, for 24 weeks or longer per RECIST v1.1 criteria.
While it is anticipated, based on the mechanism of action of ZN-c5 and advanced state of disease of the patients enrolled, that tumor regressions may not occur in this study phase, as of June 30, 2020, six (6) of the 15 patients in the Phase 1, monotherapy dose escalation portion of this trial showed SD for at least 24 weeks, leading to a CBR, of 40%. Two (2) of these patients were dosed at the low dose of 50 mg and showed SD for approximately 12 months. 
Most patients in the combination dose escalation portion of the trial have been on treatment for less than 24 weeks, an insufficient amount of time to establish the CBR. 
As of the database cutoff date of June 30, 2020, one patient in the Phase 1, monotherapy dose expansion portion of this trial at the 150 mg/day level has met the definition of a confirmed PR (reduction of 64%) per RECISTv1.1 criteria, starting after four (4) cycles of ZN-c5. Treatment of the patient is ongoing. 
The following table illustrates treatment duration and best overall response for the Phase 1, monotherapy dose escalation portion of the trial as of the database cutoff date of June 30, 2020.

ZN-c5 Pharmacokinetics Results
As of the database cutoff date of June 30, 2020, the PK of ZN-c5 observed in the first 15 patients in the Phase 1, monotherapy dose escalation portion of our ZN-c5-001 Trial was characterized by fast absorption into the systemic circulation, as evidenced by median time to maximum concentration, or Tmax, of one to two hours. As shown in the table below, the exposures have generally increased with increased doses and was 124,000 ng*hr/ml at the 300 mg dose. Additionally, we have not observed drug accumulation of ZN-c5 at steady state (Day 15). The estimated mean elimination half-life ranged between 11 and 18 hours.

ZN-c5 human drug exposure at all dose levels, ranging from 50 mg to 300 mg, exceeds the ZN-c5 effective concentration, 100%, or EC100, observed in our preclinical mouse studies at 10 mg/kg/day, the dose level associated with a 100% tumor growth inhibition in an MCF-7 mouse model. Based on the activity observed in mouse models, the exposures observed in human patients may translate into once daily, oral dosing.
Phase 1 Trial of ZN-c5 (Window of Opportunity study)
In January 2020, we dosed the first patient in our Phase 1 open label, multi-center, dose escalation trial of ZN-c5, which we refer to as our ZN-c5-002 Trial. The ZN-c5-002 Trial will be conducted at several sites in the United States, Europe and Asia-Pacific (Australia), in patients with ER+/HER2- breast cancer scheduled to undergo surgical resection of the tumor or start neoadjuvant treatment. We plan to enroll approximately 36 patients in this trial.
This is a Window of Opportunity study, the objective of which is to assess the ER degradation ability of ZN-c5 as a monotherapy over a 21-day treatment period measured using paired biopsies. We intend to evaluate various tissue and functional imaging biomarkers in response to ZN-c5 exposure. These biomarkers will assess ER degradation, progesterone receptor degradation and Ki67, a proliferation marker, using paired biopsies. In addition, tumor tissue and plasma concentration of ZN-c5 will be assessed.
ZN-c5 will be evaluated at escalating doses starting at 50 mg, orally administered, once daily. Subsequent dose levels will be determined based on PK profile, safety and any additional biomarker data observed in our ZN-c5-001 Trial.
At June 30, 2020, eight patients had been enrolled and treated: three patients at 50 mg/day, four (4) patients at 150 mg/day and one (1) patient at 300 mg/day.
We believe this trial will assist in determining the precise RP2D of ZN-c5 as a monotherapy, in conjunction with the safety, PK and pharmacodynamics, or PD, data from the ZN-c5-001 Trial. We expect to report topline results from this trial in the first half of 2021.
Phase 1b Trial of ZN-c5 in combination with abemaciclib
In November 2020, we dosed the first patient in our Phase 1b open label, multi-center trial of ZN-c5 in combination with abemaciclib in patients with ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer, which we refer to as our ZN-c5-003 Trial. This trial aims to assess the safety, tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics, and anti-tumor activity of ZN-c5 in combination with abemaciclib. The ZN-c5-003 Trial will be conducted at several sites in the United States and Europe. We plan to enroll approximately 18 patients in this trial. 
ZN-c3, an Inhibitor of WEE1 for the Treatment of Solid Tumors and Other Cancers
Overview
We are developing ZN-c3, an oral, small molecule DNA damage response product candidate, targeting WEE1 in cancer. The inhibition of WEE1, a protein tyrosine kinase, aims to generate sufficient DNA damage in cancer cells to undergo apoptosis, thereby preventing tumor growth and potentially causing tumor regression. There is currently no FDA-approved WEE1 inhibitor, and AstraZeneca’s AZD1775 is currently one of few other WEE1 inhibitors in clinical development of which we are aware. Despite the observed efficacy of AZD1775 in clinical trials, we believe its narrow therapeutic window is a potential limitation affecting its dosing in monotherapy and in combination. We have applied our expertise to design ZN-c3 to have such solubility, selectivity and PK properties that we believe may provide a broad therapeutic window and which, if ZN-c3 is approved, may constitute a differentiated product profile. We believe ZN-c3, if approved, may have broad applicability in a wide range of cancers both as monotherapy and in combination, including with chemotherapy agents, PARP inhibitors and other targeted therapies.
We have initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ZN-c3 in patients with advanced solid tumors. We plan to report results from the Phase 1, monotherapy dose escalation portion of the trial at the AACR Annual Meeting in April 2021. In addition, we initiated a Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating ZN-c3 in combination with chemotherapy in patients with advanced ovarian cancer in October 2020, and plan to initiate a Phase 2 trial evaluating ZN-c3 as monotherapy in patients with USC in 2021. We continue to actively evaluate other potential combinations for the future clinical development of ZN-c3, and intend to initiate two (2) additional Phase 1 clinical trials evaluating ZN-c3 in combination with chemotherapy and PARP inhibitor in ovarian cancer and other targeted indications in 2021.
Background on DNA Damage Repair and WEE1 Inhibitors
The underlying principle behind a number of cancer therapies is to generate sufficient DNA damage in cancer cells, many of which already have deficiencies in DNA damage response, to cause them to undergo apoptosis. Examples of these therapies include alkylating agents, DNA-binding drugs and the use of radiation. However, cancer cells have developed multiple mechanisms of resistance to these therapies, thereby potentially limiting their therapeutic efficacy.
The regulation of DNA damage response mechanisms in cancer cells may therefore play a crucial role in the induction of apoptosis and the ultimate efficacy of DNA damaging cancer therapies. This is particularly true in cancers with specific mutations in DNA repair proteins that prevent efficient DNA damage response and repair, rendering them particularly vulnerable to any agent that further inhibits the ability of cells to repair DNA damage.
Examples of such cancers are those with mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. Inhibitors of PARP, an independent DNA repair protein, work to prevent DNA damage repair, and are FDA approved for the treatment of multiple cancers, such as breast and ovarian cancers associated with BRCA1 and BCRA2 mutations. Sales of FDA-approved PARP inhibitors were approximately $1.6 billion in 2019 and are expected to grow to $6.9 billion in 2026.
Similar to PARP, WEE1 plays a role in cellular regulation and repair, allowing cells with DNA damage to repair and survive. WEE1 is a protein tyrosine kinase that mediates cell cycle arrest by regulating the phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent 
kinase 1, or CDK1. Inhibition of WEE1 causes dysregulation of DNA replication and inability of DNA response processes to act, leading to an increase in double-strand DNA breaks and subsequently inducing apoptosis. Based on these similar mechanisms of action, we believe the use of WEE1 and PARP, both DNA damage response agents, in combination can have a synergistic effect. In third-party preclinical studies, the combination of PARP and WEE1 has been observed to result in improved anti-tumor activity as compared to the use of each as monotherapy. However, both of these compounds have been associated with bone marrow toxicity, which may limit their concomitant administration.
WEE1 Inhibitor in Clinical Development and Limitations
One of few other WEE1 inhibitors currently in clinical development of which we are aware is AZD1775. AZD1775 has been the subject of many publications in the scientific literature and has been explored in numerous clinical trials across multiple tumor types. AZD1775 is currently being evaluated by third parties in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials in ovarian cancer and a variety of other solid tumors, both as monotherapy and in combination with other cancer therapies. In earlier third-party clinical trials, multiple patients with advanced or metastatic tumors for whom no standard therapy was available achieved partial responses when dosed with AZD1775 in combination with chemotherapy agents. For example, in a Phase 2 clinical trial in 24 patients (21 of such patients were evaluable for efficacy) with relapsed ovarian cancer, the combination of AZD1775 and carboplatin, an FDA-approved chemotherapy, demonstrated an overall response rate of 43% and one patient exhibited a complete response lasting over 42 months.
In addition, in a recent Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with recurrent USC, an aggressive subtype of endometrial carcinoma characterized by TP53 mutations, AZD1775 administered as monotherapy demonstrated an overall response rate of 30%.
Further, in a recent Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer, AZD1775 in combination with gemcitabine, an FDA-approved chemotherapy, and radiation resulted in a median overall survival of 21.7 months. This overall survival was substantially longer than the 11.9 to 13.6 months observed in a prior clinical trial with a similar population of patients combining gemcitabine with or without erlotinib with radiation.
Although AZD1775 has demonstrated promising efficacy in clinical trials, we believe AZD1775 has a narrow therapeutic window, a potential limitation affecting its dosing as monotherapy and in combination. Furthermore, the use of AZD1775 in combination with PARP inhibitors in preclinical studies has demonstrated increased bone marrow toxicities, thereby potentially limiting its use in continuous dosing. We believe AZD1775 has a number of characteristics that could be improved upon, including selectivity, solubility, PK properties and tumor concentration.
Our WEE1 Solution: ZN-c3
ZN-c3 is our oral WEE1 inhibitor product candidate that we are currently evaluating for the treatment of advanced solid tumors in an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial. We believe ZN-c3 has the potential to provide a wide therapeutic window due to the following observed clinical and preclinical results:

•Potency, selectivity and solubility. In our preclinical studies, ZN-c3 produced favorable absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, or ADME, results. In our in vitro preclinical studies, we observed ZN-c3’s potency in inhibiting tumor growth and inducing apoptosis through DNA damage, and ZN-c3 has shown high selectivity for WEE1. In addition, in a series of repeat preclinical studies assessing the solubility of ZN-c3 and AZD1775 utilizing a standard in vitro assay and uniform controls, ZN-c3 demonstrated solubility of 2,132,000 nM, approximately 35 times greater than that of AZD1775, which we believe could reduce inter-patient drug exposure variability and limit the toxicity observed in clinical trials of AZD1775.
•Preclinical anti-tumor activity. In head-to-head preclinical studies, ZN-c3 showed anti-tumor activity across a number of cell lines, as well as superior tumor growth inhibition, DNA damage and apoptosis when compared to AZD1775. Anti-tumor activity was observed in both continuous and intermittent dosing, as well as in the shorter of the dosing periods evaluated.
•PK properties. In our preclinical studies, ZN-c3 showed PK properties that resulted in high drug exposure in animal models. We believe this level of drug exposure may contribute to the observed sustained and lengthy tumor growth inhibition, which may necessitate lower dose intensity thereby potentially affording a wide therapeutic window. In addition, we observed that ZN-c3 had favorable drug accumulation in tumors.
•Well tolerated in preclinical studies and clinical trials. In preclinical studies and clinical trials to date, ZN-c3 was observed to be well tolerated across varying dosage levels.
In addition to having a potentially wide therapeutic window, we believe the characteristics of ZN-c3 may allow patients with aggressive solid tumors to be treated with sequential therapy using mechanism of action synergistic multiple agents, including PARP inhibitors. In a third-party preclinical combination study with PARP inhibitors, sequential dosing resulted in favorable tolerability as compared to continuous dosing, while maintaining strong anti-tumor activity.
We have completed the dose escalation part of our Phase 1 monotherapy study, and we plan to report data from the dose escalation portion of the trial at the AACR Annual Meeting in April 2021.
Preclinical Results
Potency Across Variety of Solid Tumor Cell Lines
We assessed the potency of ZN-c3 and AZD1775 in repeat in vitro preclinical studies across a variety of solid tumor cell lines, as shown in the table below. We observed ZN-c3’s potency in inhibiting tumor growth and inducing DNA damage and apoptosis in each of the solid tumor cell lines studied.

Selectivity of ZN-c3 in Kinase Screening Panel
In our head-to-head in vitro preclinical studies, we assessed the selectivity of ZN-c3, alongside AZD1775. The selectivity profile of each of ZN-c3 (right) and AZD1775 (left) was characterized against a broad kinase panel for WEE1 consisting of 485 mammalian serine/threonine and tyrosine, as depicted by the respective kinase dendograms below. ZN-c3 and AZD1775 were tested at a single concentration to determine the percentage inhibition at 1 μM. ZN-c3 was observed to have higher selectivity relative to that of AZD1775 as depicted by the overall fewer kinases being affected in the ZN-c3 dendogram.

Solubility of ZN-c3
We assessed the relative ADME properties and solubility of ZN-c3 and a proxy chemical compound of AZD1775 in a series of repeat preclinical studies. ZN-c3 showed targeted ADME properties, and demonstrated solubility of 2,132 µM, approximately 35 times greater than the 60 µM observed with AZD1775 in repeat preclinical studies. We believe greater solubility may reduce interpatient variability, and in turn limit toxicities for ZN-c3.
Anti-Tumor Activity in Human Lung Cancer Model
In a preclinical study, we assessed the anti-tumor potential of ZN-c3 alongside AZD1775, each as a monotherapy, in a lung cancer model using human A-427 cells that contained a KRAS mutation. In this model, doses of 40 mg/kg or 80 mg/kg of ZN-c3 demonstrated tumor shrinkage that was evident at the first post-treatment observation at four (4) days and continued through the end of the experiment. Across dose levels there was no statistical difference between ZN-c3 and AZD1775 and each compound produced tumor regression. ZN-c3 was observed to be well tolerated across all doses.

Anti-Tumor Activity in Lung Cancer Model Across Varying Dosage Levels and Intermittent Dosing Regimen
We have explored various dosing regimens of ZN-c3 in preclinical studies. A loading dose of 120 mg/kg daily for seven (7) days followed by once-daily dosing of 100 mg/kg resulted in ten (10) out of ten (10) treated mice being tumor free after five (5) weeks. We also explored the potential of shorter dosing periods or intermittent dosing of ZN-c3 in preclinical studies. A loading dose of 120 mg/kg for five (5) days followed by two (2) days off drug followed by five (5) weeks of 100 mg/kg given five (5) days on, two (2) days off resulted in seven (7) out of ten (10) mice being tumor free as shown in the graph below. A loading dose of 120 mg/kg for seven (7) days followed by seven (7) days off drug followed by two cycles of seven (7) days on 100 mg/kg drug and seven (7) days off drug resulted in five (5) out of ten (10) mice being tumor free as shown in the graph below.

We also assessed the potential of utilizing an intermittent dosing regimen with ZN-c3 alongside that of AZD1775 in a preclinical study. Dosing of ZN-c3 by using a loading dose of 120 mg/kg for four (4) days followed by three days off drug 
followed by five (5) weeks of 100 mg/kg given four (4) days on, three (3) days off resulted in more prolonged tumor growth delay than that observed with AZD1775 at the same dosing regimen.
PK Data Comparison in Animal Models
We assessed the PK properties of ZN-c3 and AZD1775 in repeat preclinical animal models, as shown in the table below. For each of the preclinical studies, we observed the respective Cmax, Tmax, AUC and tumor concentration of each compound at doses of 20, 40 and 80 mg/kg/day. Administration of ZN-c3 was observed to result in high drug exposure in animal models and the selective accumulation of ZN-c3 to high levels in tumors. We believe this increased drug exposure may cause the inhibition of WEE1 at low doses, potentially affording a wide therapeutic window.

Toxicology Results
ZN-c3 was evaluated in 28-day repeat dose toxicology studies. Results of these studies showed many of the toxicities associated with other WEE1 inhibitors in development, including those reported for AZD1775.
Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial of ZN-c3
In November 2019, we initiated a Phase 1/2 open label, multi-center trial of ZN-c3 in patients with advanced solid tumors, which we refer to as our ZN-c3-001 Trial, to assess the safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK properties and pharmacodynamics of ZN-c3 as a single agent and in combination with a number of potential therapies, including PARP inhibitor. We plan to enroll up to 360 patients in this trial, which is being conducted at several sites in the United States. Our ZN-c3-001 Trial currently consists of a monotherapy dose escalation portion of the trial and a dose expansion portion to evaluate ZN-c3 as monotherapy and in combination with relevant combination therapies. 
The primary objective of the Phase 1, monotherapy dose escalation portion of the trial is to assess the safety and tolerability of ZN-c3 as a single agent and to determine the MTD or RP2D. The secondary objectives are to assess the PK properties and obtain preliminary assessments of anti-tumor efficacy of ZN-c3 as a single agent, as well as exploratory PD characteristics.
We plan to enroll up to 70 patients in the Phase 1, monotherapy trial and the patient population will be limited to patients with solid tumors with advanced or metastatic disease who are refractory or ineligible to receive standard therapies, or for whom no standard therapy is available. We expect to report topline results from the Phase 1, monotherapy dose escalation portion of this trial in 2021.
The primary objective of the dose expansion portion of the trial will be to assess the anti-tumor efficacy of ZN-c3 by objective response rate at the RP2D. The secondary objectives of the dose expansion portion will be to assess the anti-tumor efficacy of ZN-c3 by duration of response, clinical benefit rate and PFS as monotherapy, and to assess the PK parameters of ZN-c3.
Phase 1b Clinical Trial of ZN-c3
We initiated a Phase 1b, combination dose escalation clinical trial evaluating ZN-c3 in combination with chemotherapy in patients with advanced ovarian cancer in October 2020.
The primary objective of this Phase 1b, combination dose escalation trial is to determine the MTD or RP2D for ZN-c3 when administered in combination with chemotherapy.

Interim Clinical Results
Interim data is subject to change as more data on these patients and additional patients become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.
Safety Results
As of the June 19, 2020 database cutoff, in the Phase 1, monotherapy dose escalation portion of the ongoing ZN-c3-001 trial, a total of 22 patients were enrolled and dosed and had data available in the electronic data capture system: two (2) patients each at the dose levels of 25 mg, 50 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg, four (4) patients at 100 mg and ten (10) patients at 75 mg/day. Enrollment in the Phase 1, monotherapy dose escalation portion of this trial is ongoing, and a total of up to 50 patients may be enrolled. 
As of the June 19, 2020 database cutoff, no dose limiting toxicities were observed. TEAEs occurred in 21 of the 22 patients. Nausea was observed in seven (7) patients; diarrhea in six (6) patients; fatigue in five (5) patients; anemia in four (4) patients; and abdominal distention, decreased appetite, dyspnea, gamma-glutamyltransferase increased, pyrexia and vomiting in three patients each. All other adverse events were observed in one or two (2) patients each. A single TEAE of Grade 4 severity (ALT increased) was observed. TEAEs of Grade 3 severity included two (2) cases of gamma-glutamyltransferase increased, and single cases of anemia, hepatic enzyme increased, blood bilirubin increased, hypertension, sepsis, and AST increased. All other TEAEs were of Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity. The Grade 3 TEAEs of sepsis, anemia (n = 2) and hepatic enzyme increase also accounted for four (4) of the six (6) serious adverse events reported. The other two serious adverse events included Grade 2 transient ischemic attack and large intestinal obstruction. No serious adverse event was deemed related to ZN-c3. There were no deaths reported.
Investigator assessed treatment-related adverse events occurred in 14 of 22 patients. These treatment-related adverse events included diarrhea and nausea in three patients each, fatigue and vomiting in two (2) patients each, and other single adverse events. A single treatment-related adverse event of Grade 4 severity (ALT increased) was observed. Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events reported included AST increased and hepatic enzyme increased. All others were of Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity. None of the liver function test abnormalities were indicative of drug-induced liver injury. Of the two (2) patients with treatment-related hepatic enzyme increased, one had a history of ethanol use. 
Overall, as of the June 19, 2020 database cutoff date, there was no increase in incidence or in severity of adverse events observed with increasing dosing levels. 
The following graphs show hematological parameters (neutrophilis, platelets or hemoglobin) on study for individual patients in each of the higher dose groups (100 mg/day, 200 mg/day and 300 mg/day). As of the June 19, 2020 database cutoff date, we have observed higher exposures with escalating doses of ZN-c3. Of note, these exposures have not led to a negative effect on hematological parameters (neutrophilis, platelets or hemoglobin).

ZN-c3 Pharmacokinetics Results
As of the June 19, 2020 database cutoff date, upon oral dosing at the dose levels of 25 mg to 200 mg, ZN-c3 was absorbed into the systemic circulation with the median Tmax of one (1) to four (4) hours and the typical half-life was six (6) to nine (9) hours. As shown in the table below, Cmax and AUC values of ZN-c3 increased in an approximately dose proportional manner on Day 1 and greater than dose proportionally on Day 15. Based on AUC, there was low to no ZN-c3 accumulation on Day 15 compared to Day 1, with accumulation ratios ranging between 0.72- and 2.38-fold.

ZN-d5, an Inhibitor of BCL-2 for the Treatment of Hematologic Cancers
Overview
We are developing ZN-d5, an oral selective inhibitor of BCL-2, an intracellular protein that suppresses apoptosis for the treatment of cancers, with an initial focus on hematologic malignancies. We have applied our expertise to design ZN-d5 as an oral BCL-2 inhibitor and to have optimized potency, selectivity and PK.
We began enrolling subjects in a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating ZN-d5 in patients with relapsed or refractory NHL and AML, in October 2020. This trial is initially enrolling subjects with NHL and we expect to open enrollment to subjects with AML in 2021. This dose-escalation study is designed to assess the safety, efficacy and PK of ZN-d5, and to determine the MTD and RP2D in NHL and AML. In 2021, we intend to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating ZN-d5 as monotherapy and Phase 1b clinical trial in combination with ZN-c5, our oral SERD product candidate, in patients with ER+/HER2- breast cancer. 
Role of BCL-2 in Hematological Cancers
The BCL-2 family of protein is most notable for its critical role in the regulation of apoptosis at the mitochondrion. Based upon their functions, BCL-2 family proteins are classified into pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic members. The anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins include BCL-2, B-cell lymphoma extra-large, or BCL-xL, myeloid cell leukemia-1, or MCL-1, and BCL-2 related protein Al.
The overexpression of BCL-2 and/or BCL-xL proteins is frequently detected in many different types of cancers, including chronic lymphatic leukemia, or CLL, SLL, AML, NHL (including follicular lymphoma, or FL, mantle-cell lymphoma, or MCL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL),Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, multiple myeloma, or MM, and small cell lung cancer, or SCLC. These overexpressed proteins prevent apoptosis of cancer cells. We believe the use of small molecule inhibitors to block the protein-protein interactions of BCL-2 and/or BCL-xL with their pro-apoptotic partners will restore the normal apoptosis process in cancer cells. This new cancer therapeutic strategy has been validated through the recent approval of Venetoclax as described below.
There have been many attempts to develop a new class of anticancer therapies that target BCL-2 and/or BCL-xL proteins. The intracellular localization of the BCL-2 family proteins on the mitochondrial membrane prevents the use of antibodies and other large molecules to target these anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins. The large surface area involved in BCL-2 PPIs also makes BCL-2 family proteins difficult targets for small molecule drugs. Currently, venetoclax is the only FDA-approved BCL-2 inhibitor and, to our knowledge, there are only a small number of additional agents in active clinical development.
FDA-Approved BCL-2 Inhibitor, Venetoclax
Venetoclax, the only FDA-approved BCL-2 inhibitor (marketed by AbbVie and Genentech as Venclexta®), was initially developed to overcome unfavorable side effects of previously tested BCL-2 inhibitors resulting from BCL-xL inhibition, which is known to cause thrombocytopenia. Venetoclax has demonstrated clinical efficacy across a range of hematological malignancies and is now FDA-approved for the treatment of adult patients with CLL and SCC, and in combination with azacitidine, or decitabine, or low-dose cytarabine for the treatment of newly diagnosed AML in adults 75 years of age or older, or who have comorbidities that preclude use of intensive induction chemotherapy. Common adverse reactions for Venclexta in CLL/SLL include neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, diarrhea, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, cough, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and edema, and in AML include nausea, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, constipation, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, fatigue, vomiting, edema, pyrexia, pneumonia, dyspnea, hemorrhage, anemia, rash, abdominal pain, sepsis, musculoskeletal pain, dizziness, cough, oropharyngeal pain, and hypotension (source: Venclexta prescribing information, February 18, 2021).
Promising results for venetoclax have been reported in a variety of other hematologic malignancies as monotherapy and in combination with other targeted agents as well as traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. Worldwide sales of Venclexta® were approximately $1.3 billion in 2020, an increase of 69% from 2019.
Emerging Role of BCL-2 in Solid Tumors
Although the development of venetoclax has to date been primarily limited to hematologic cancers, a study in a panel of cell lines derived from a variety of tumors demonstrated that BCL-2 expression and venetoclax sensitivity has been observed in multiple solid tumors. These include SCLC, bone, breast, and nervous system tumors. A clinical trial of venetoclax in combination with tamoxifen in patients with ER+/BCL-2+ metastatic breast cancer showed a 54% response rate and clinical benefit rate of 75%, providing clinical evidence that BCL-2 inhibition is a viable target in solid tumors (source: Lok et al., Cancer Discovery 2019; 9:354-369. https://doi.org/10.1158/2159-8290.CD-18-1151).
Additionally, the efficacy of venetoclax used in combination with fulvestrant versus fulvestrant administered as monotherapy is being evaluated in an ongoing third-party Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with ER+/HER2- breast cancer.
Our BCL-2 Inhibitor: ZN-d5
ZN-d5 is our oral, small molecule BCL-2 inhibitor product candidate for the treatment of cancers, with the initial focus on hematologic malignancies. We have designed ZN-d5 to have the following characteristics:

•Potency. In our preclinical studies, ZN-d5 was observed to be potent in cell lines and xenograft models across a variety of hematological malignancies.
•Selectivity. In our in vitro studies, ZN-d5 showed more than 600 times greater selectivity for BCL-2 than BCL-xL. The inhibition of BCL-xL is a known cause of thrombocytopenia, a commonly reported toxicity in patients treated with venetoclax. We believe ZN-d5's greater selectivity for BCL-2 over BCL-xL observed in preclinical studies may support the use of ZN-d5 in combination with other drugs that are associated with a high rate of thrombocytopenia.
•Tolerability profile. In our animal toxicity studies, ZN-d5 was observed to be well tolerated across various dosage levels.
We believe the observed properties of ZN-d5 make it an attractive candidate for evaluation as monotherapy and in combination with other therapies, initially for the treatment of hematological malignancies. As noted above, ZN-d5 entered clinical trials in the third quarter of 2020 in a Phase 1 dose escalation study that is currently enrolling NHL patients. Our plans for 2021 for ZN-d5 include opening enrollment in the ongoing study to patients with AML and launching a Phase 1b trial in combination with ZN-c5, our oral SERD product candidate, in patients with ER+/HER2- breast cancer in 2021.
Preclinical Results
Potency and Selectivity Across Hematological Malignancies
In an in vitro preclinical study, we assessed the selectivity and potency of ZN-d5 alongside venetoclax. As shown in the table below, we assessed the affinity of each agent as measured in nM in a biochemical assay. Based on these measurements, ZN-d5 showed 600 times greater selectivity for BCL-2 than BCL-xL, and we believe such selectivity may limit the incidence of thrombocytopenia observed in third-party clinical trials as a result of BCL-xL inhibition. We also observed that ZN-d5 was potent across hematological malignancy cell lines as measured by CellTiter-Glo, or CTG, a cell viability assay, shown in the table below.

In a preclinical study, we also assessed the platelet toxicity of ZN-d5 against venetoclax, as measured by mM in a platelet viability assay. In each assay, ZN-d5 was observed to be less toxic to platelets than venetoclax, which we believe may limit the incidence of thrombocytopenia.

Potency for BCL-2 Mutations
We believe genetic mutations in the BCL-2 gene may be responsible for a developed resistance to venetoclax observed in some CLL patients. In a third-party clinical trial, 16 of 29 patients acquired mutations in members of the BCL-2 family of proteins, 14 of which were a mutation in BCL-2. In nine (9) of those 14 patients, the BCL-2 mutation was detected after 24 months on venetoclax. In an in vitro preclinical study, we assessed the affinity of ZN-d5 alongside venetoclax, to bind to such BCL-2 mutations, as measured in nM. In each assay, ZN-d5 was observed to bind with higher affinity to such BCL-2 mutants as compared to venetoclax.

Anti-Tumor Activity of ZN-d5 in Xenograft Leukemia Model
In a preclinical study, we assessed the anti-tumor activity of ZN-d5, alongside venetoclax. In a RS4;11 xenograft leukemia mouse model, ZN-d5, dosed at 50 mg/kg daily for a period of 11 days, showed potent anti-tumor activity with tumors shrinking upon treatment and yielding durable complete responses after cessation of dosing to the end of the study, as shown in the graphic below. We observed similar results with venetoclax in this model.
Toxicology
The IND enabling toxicology studies are currently ongoing.
ZN-e4, an Inhibitor of EGFR for the Treatment of NSCLC
Overview
We are developing ZN-e4, an irreversible inhibitor of EGFR, a regulator of a number of cellular functions, including proliferation and survival, and a driver of tumorigenesis in certain cancers, including lung cancer. We have designed ZN-e4 to be highly selective against mutant EGFR, and in animal studies, the metabolites of ZN-e4 do not include any compounds known to bind potently to the wild-type EGFR. We believe the presence of such, the production of which is believed to be responsible for the development of a number of toxicities, including skin rash. We believe that eliminating the formation of such a metabolite will allow for a wide therapeutic window. In addition, we believe a more tolerable EGFR inhibitor would, if approved, allow for use in combination while limiting the toxicity associated with use in combination.
We are conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ZN-e4 in patients with advanced NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations, which we refer to as our ZN-e4-001 Trial. We are actively evaluating potential combination therapies for future clinical development of ZN-e4. We will evaluate whether to initiate the Phase 2 portion of this trial upon the completion of the Phase 1 portion and after considering trial design, patient population and combination strategies. We expect to report topline results from the Phase 1 portion of the trial in 2021.

Role of EGFR Inhibition in NSCLC
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for both men and women, accounting for approximately 18% of all cancer deaths globally. There are an estimated 228,000 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed and 143,000 deaths in the United States annually. More than half of the people with lung cancer die within one year of being diagnosed. Non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, accounts for approximately 80-85% of lung cancer cases. EGFR mutations are detected in approximately 10% to 15% and 30% to 40% of Caucasian and Asian patients, respectively, with NSCLC.
EGFR mutations lead to activation of EGFR signaling and oncogenic transformation both in vitro and in vivo. Cancers with EGFR mutations depend on EGFR signaling for growth and survival and are often sensitive to treatment with EGFR inhibitors. Two (2) inhibitors of EGFR were approved in the early 2000s to treat patients with advanced NSCLC based on antitumor responses in a subset of patients. These first-generation drugs, erlotinib and gefitinib, were reversible EGFR inhibitors. Although most NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations displayed an initial pronounced response to these first-generation EGFR inhibitors, they acquired resistance to the drugs after approximately nine (9) to 14 months of treatment. The T790M mutation of EGFR was the most common mechanism of such an acquired resistance, having been detected in over 50% of patients treated with EGFR inhibitors.
A second-generation of EGFR inhibitors was developed to address this treatment resistance and to improve upon the efficacy of the first-generation therapies. The second-generation of EGFR inhibitors, including afatinib, marketed as Gilotrif® by Boehringer Ingelheim, and dacomitib, marketed as Vizimpro® by Pfizer, are irreversible inhibitors which covalently bind to EGFR. As such, they are more potent, but are associated with increased toxicity. Further, T790M-mediated acquired resistance occurred at a similar frequency in patients receiving a second-generation therapy as those receiving first generation therapy. Third-generation therapies, such as osimertinib, specifically targeting the T790M mutation have been clinically shown to be a useful strategy in the treatment of NSCLC.
FDA-Approved Third-Generation EGFR Inhibitor, Osimertinib
Osimertinib, which represents the third-generation of EGFR inhibitors, targets EGFR mutations and acquired resistance EGFR mutations such as T790M in order to improve upon the efficacy of previous generations of EGFR inhibitors. In a randomized Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with EGFR-mutated metastatic NSCLC, osimertinib demonstrated a median PFS period of 18.9 months versus 10.2 months for the control arm in which patients received gefitinib or erlotinib. Based on these results, osimertinib was approved by the FDA in November 2015. AstraZeneca reported sales of Tagrisso® of $4.3 billion in 2020, an increase of 36% from 2019 and are expected to grow to $9.5 billion in 2026.
Osimertinib was also designed to have reduced potency against non-mutated, or wild-type, EGFR found in healthy cells, thereby minimizing the toxicities associated with first and second-generation EGFR inhibitors. Despite its observed success in addressing the T790M-mediated acquired resistance and improved efficacy, osimertinib has a similar adverse event profile to first and second-generation EGFR inhibitors. As demonstrated by third-party clinical data, approximately 60% of patients dosed with osimertinib reported rashes compared to 80% of those dosed with gefitinib or erlotinib and a range of 70% to 90% for the second-generation EGFR inhibitor, afatinib. In addition, similar levels of gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhea were observed in each of the patient populations. Osimertinib also has warnings and precautions regarding interstitial lung disease, QT prolongation, a surrogate marker for the risk of developing tachycardias, cardiomyopathy, keratitis and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome.
We believe one of the major metabolites of osimertinib, AZ5104, which accounts for approximately 9% to 10% of the total drug concentration at clinical doses, may be contributing to these toxicities. In addition, the off-target toxicities are exacerbated by the long half-life of osimertinib.

Our EGFR Solution: ZN-e4
ZN-e4 is our irreversible EGFR inhibitor product candidate which we have designed to potently inhibit mutant EGFR, including the T790M resistance mutation. We have designed ZN-e4 to be highly selective against mutant EGFR and have observed in preclinical studies that the administration of ZN-e4 does not produce a metabolite potent for wild-type EGFR. We 
have also designed ZN-e4 with improved physical-chemical characteristics, including improved solubility. In a head-to-head preclinical study, ZN-e4 showed greater than 450-fold solubility within 48 hours when compared to osimertinib.
We are evaluating ZN-e4 in our Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with advanced NSCLC. We believe ZN-e4, if approved, has the potential to be used as monotherapy and in combination with a number of therapies, including ZN-c3, our WEE1 inhibitor product candidate, if approved, tyrosine-protein kinase Met, or c-Met, inhibitors, mitogen-activated protein kinase, or MEK, inhibitors, and c-ros oncogene1 receptor tyrosine kinase, or ROS1, inhibitors. Results of various third-party preclinical studies and clinical trials support such combinations across a number of oncology indications and we continue to actively evaluate the potential of combinations for future clinical development with ZN-e4.
Preclinical Results
Selectivity Across EGFR Cell Lines
In a preclinical study, we evaluated the potency of ZN-e4 alongside osimertinib against three types of EGFR cell lines –double mutant (DM cell), single mutant (AM cell) and wild-type (WT cell). As shown in the table below, we observed similar potency in the DM and AM cell lines and three times greater selectivity than osimertinib based on the wild-type binding. In addition, we also observed that the administration of ZN-e4 did not produce a metabolite potent for wild type EGFR.

 | DOUBLE MUTANT CELLIC50 (nM) | SINGLE MUTANT CELLIC50 (nM) | | WILD-TYPE CELLIC50 (nM)
Osimertinib(1): Core Drug | 15 | | 29 | | 294
ZN-e4: Core Drug | 20 | | 38 | | 839

Anti-tumor Activity, Tolerability and Solubility of ZN-e4
In a preclinical study, we evaluated the anti-tumor activity of ZN-e4 alongside that of osimertinib. In a NCI-H1975 NSCLC tumor model in which there is a double mutation in EGFR, T790M and L858R, oral dosing of ZN-e4 for 14 days at the dose tested, 10 mg/kg, induced complete tumor regression, as did 10 mg/kg osimertinib dosed orally. In addition, ZN-e4 at this dose was well tolerated in these models with no apparent loss in body weight throughout the study. In contrast, the 10 mg/kg dose of osimertinib led to a loss of greater than 8% of total body weight. We observed a similar loss of body weight with ZN-e4 when we increased the dose to 50 mg/kg, roughly five (5) times the dose we found to reduce tumor volumes.
We also assessed the relative solubility of ZN-c3, alongside a proxy chemical compound of osimertinib, using a standard in vitro assay. The solubility of ZN-e4 was observed to be 1,614,000 nM, greater than 450 fold the solubility that of osimertinib which was observed at 3,500 nM. In addition, we did not observe confirmed cardiac toxicity as measured by the standard electrophysiological hERG safety assay.
Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial of ZN-e4
In April 2018, we initiated dosing in a Phase 1/2 open label, multi-center trial of ZN-e4 in patients with advanced NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations who have progressed following therapy with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which we refer to as our ZN-e4-001 Trial, to assess the safety, tolerability, PK and anti-tumor activity of ZN-e4. The study is currently being conducted across multiple sites in the United States, it consists of a Phase 1, monotherapy 3+3 dose escalation portion of this trial and a Phase 2 portion of this trial.
The primary objective of the Phase 1 portion of this trial is to determine the MTD of ZN-e4 as an oral monotherapy. The secondary objectives include assessing the safety and tolerability, determining a RP2D and characterizing the PK, of ZN-e4.
As of February 5, 2020, 19 patients had been enrolled in this trial in seven (7) dose level cohorts. We expect to report topline results from the Phase 1 portion of this trial in 2021. We will evaluate whether to initiate the Phase 2 portion of this trial upon the completion of the Phase 1 portion and after considering trial design, patient population and combination strategies.
Interim and Preliminary Clinical Results
As of the February 5, 2020 database cutoff date, we completed dosing in six (6) of our dose escalation cohorts and have enrolled two (2) patients in cohort seven. Nineteen patients have been enrolled and treated with doses of ZN-e4 ranging from 20 mg to 480 mg, once daily. At baseline, the mean age of the enrolled population was 63.9 years (range 38 to 86 years) and consisted of 47% females and 53% males. Of the enrolled patients, six (6) (31.6%) are continuing treatment and 13 (68.4%) have discontinued treatment, nine (9) of which were due to disease progression.
Enrolled patients have received the following prior lines of cancer treatment: EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (16 of 19 patients), chemotherapy (12 of 19 patients), osimertinib (11 of 19 patients), immunotherapy (five (5) of 19 patients), investigational EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (two (2) of 19 patients) and EGFR monoclonal antibodies (two (2) of 19 patients). Of the enrolled patients, 12 of the 19 had one to three prior systemic cancer regimens, and seven (7) of the 19 had four (4) or more.
The interim and preliminary data described herein are subject to change as more data on these patients and additional patients become available and are subject to authorization and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.
Interim ZN-e4 Preliminary Safety Results
As of the February 5, 2020 database cutoff date, ZN-e4 was generally well tolerated. One patient reported a dose-limiting toxicity at the 320 mg dose level. The trial is currently ongoing at a dose level of 480 mg.
TEAEs occurred in 18 of 19 patients. No serious adverse events were reported. Two (2) deaths occurred during the safety reporting time period of the study, each due to progression of disease and determined to not be related to treatment.
The most frequent of these TEAEs observed were diarrhea (11 of 19 patients), nausea (six (6) of 19 patients), fatigue (six (6) of 19 patients), back pain (five (5) of 19 patients), cough (five (5) of 19 patients), dyspnea (four (4) of 19 patients) and vomiting (four (4) of 19 patients). All cases of diarrhea were Grade 1 except for one which was Grade 2. Rash of Grade 1 severity was only reported in one patient.
Investigator-assessed, treatment-related adverse events occurred in 11 of 19 patients. Of these treatment-related adverse events, nine (9) of 19 patients reported treatment-related adverse events of Grade 1 or Grade 2 severity and two (2) of 19 patients reported treatment-related adverse events of Grade 3 in severity; one case of dysphagia and two (2) cases of fatigue.
As of the February 5, 2020 database cutoff date, there was no apparent increase of incidence or severity of adverse events with increased dose.

Interim and Preliminary Efficacy Results
As of the February 5, 2020 database cutoff date, we observed that two (2) patients, each of which was osimertinib naïve and one of which had the T790M mutation, had confirmed PR by RECIST criteria as showing their best overall response, one dosed at 160 mg and one at 320 mg. One patient dosed at 480 mg showed an unconfirmed PR as of the cutoff date. One other patient currently with stable disease had a reduction in target lesion size of approximately 29%.

Drug Pharmacokinetics
As of the February 5, 2020 database cutoff date, PK results were available for the first 17 patients dosed in our ZN-e4 Trial. The PK results from such patients showed rapid absorption into the systemic circulation, with typical median Tmax values 
of two (2) to four (4) hours. The exposures were observed to be dose dependent. Little to no ZN-e4 accumulation at steady state on day 15 of once daily dosing was observed with mean day 15 to day one AUC ratios of 1.0-1.8.

Manufacturing
We currently do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely for the foreseeable future, on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to produce our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. We require that our CMOs produce bulk drug substances and finished drug products in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, and all other applicable laws and regulations. We maintain agreements with our manufacturers that include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to our product candidates.
We have engaged CMOs to manufacture and package ZN-c5, ZN-c3, ZN-d5 and ZN-e4 for preclinical and clinical use. Additional CMOs are used to label and distribute ZN-c5, ZN-c3 and ZN-e4 for clinical use. We obtain our supplies from these CMOs on a purchase order basis and do not have long-term supply arrangements in place. Although we do not currently have contractual arrangements in place for redundant supply for all of these product candidates, it is our goal to identify and contract with at least two (2) manufacturers for active pharmaceutical ingredient and two (2) manufacturers for drug product. More broadly, for each of our product candidates, we intend to identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient and fill-and-finish services prior to seeking regulatory approval.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid technological advancement, significant competition and an emphasis on intellectual property. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with current therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize medicines that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or less expensive than any medicines we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. We believe that the key competitive factors affecting the success of any of our product candidates, if approved, will include efficacy, combinability, safety profile, convenience, cost, level of promotional activity devoted to them and intellectual property protection.
If the product candidates for our priority programs are approved for the indications we are currently targeting, they will compete with the drugs discussed below. Furthermore, it is possible that other companies are also engaged in discovery or preclinical development of drug candidates for the same indications. These competitors, if successful in clinical development, may achieve regulatory approval and market adoption in advance of our product candidates, constraining our ability to gain significant market share for such product candidates. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, will complete with multiple approved drugs or drugs that may be approved for future indications for which we develop such product candidate.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on know-how relating to our proprietary technology and product candidates and continuing innovation to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position. We also plan to rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions when available. Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions and improvements; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including any patents that we may own in the future; and to operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. Intellectual property rights may not address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.
With respect to our product candidates and processes we intend to develop and commercialize in the normal course of business, we intend, or understand that our licensors intend, to pursue patent protection covering, when possible, compositions, methods of use, dosing and formulations. We or our licensors also may pursue patent protection with respect to manufacturing and drug development processes and technologies. Obtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment, and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies. We or our licensors may not be able to obtain patent protections for our compositions, methods of use, dosing and formulations, manufacturing and drug development processes and technologies throughout the world. Issued patents can provide protection for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In general, patents issued for applications filed in the United States can provide exclusionary rights for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In addition, in certain instances, the term of an issued U.S. patent that is directed to or claims an FDA-approved product can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, which is called “patent term extension.” The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The term of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with the laws of the foreign jurisdiction, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent. Patent term may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our products for an adequate amount of time.
The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of biopharmaceuticals has emerged in the United States. The relevant patent laws and their interpretation outside of the United States is also uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our technology or product candidates and could affect the value of such intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing products that infringe our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions and improvements. We cannot guarantee that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products, the methods of use or manufacture of those products. Moreover, even our issued patents do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products. Patent and other 
intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology space are evolving and involve many risks and uncertainties. For example, third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology, and our issued patents may be challenged, invalidated, deemed unenforceable or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing-related products or could limit the term of patent protection that otherwise may exist for our product candidates. In addition, the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies that are outside the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents. For these reasons, we may face competition with respect to our product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any patent directed to such product may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the commercial advantage the patent provides.

Recurium IP Holdings, LLC or Zeno Management, Inc., are currently the listed owner/assignee, or retained the exclusive license to 51 families of patent applications directed to our technology across our pipeline. As of March 22, 2021, our in-licensed portfolio consists of fourteen U.S. patents and eighteen foreign patents in nine (9) jurisdictions, including Europe, Australia, New Zealand, China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan.
As of March 22, 2021, 15 of the 51 families have a single application pending, and 36 of 51 families have multiple applications pending. The 51 families include 45 U.S. applications (including pending U.S. provisional patent applications and pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications), 43 PCT applications and more than 200 international applications in approximately 18 countries, including major markets in North America, South America, Europe and Asia, each having a nominal expiration date ranging from 2034 to 2041. The nominal expiration of our patents and patent applications does not account for any applicable patent term adjustments or extensions.
U.S. Patent No. 10,513,509, or the ‘509 Patent, includes claims directed to composition of matter, including ZN-e4, a pharmaceutical composition, a method for inhibiting replication of a malignant growth or a tumor, a method for ameliorating or treating a cancer and a method for inhibiting the activity of EGFR. The ‘509 Patent has an expected expiration date in May 2037. However, we believe the ‘509 Patent may be eligible for a patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act.
One of the aforementioned pending U.S. and PCT patent applications includes claims directed to ZN-c5, ZN-c3 or ZN-d5, and has an expected expiration in 2037 (ZN-c5) and 2039 (ZN-c3 and ZN-d5). However, there can be no assurance that any of our pending in-licensed patent applications will issue. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustments to the term of any of our in-licensed issued patents or patents that are issued in the future. The applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, may not agree with our assessment of whether such patent term extensions should be granted, and, if granted, they may grant more limited extensions than we request.
Trademarks
As of July 8, 2020, our trademark portfolio contains the following trademarks applications or registrations. U.S. trademark applications are pending for each of the marks ZENTALIS and the stylized “Z” mark. The mark ZENO has a registered U.S. trademark. Applications to register the marks ZENO and ZENTALIS have been filed internationally. The portfolio has an International Madrid Trademark Application designating Australia, Europe, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and Singapore for the mark ZENO. The portfolio also has pending applications for registration and/or a registration has issued for one or more classes in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Hong Kong and Taiwan for the mark ZENO. The portfolio also has an International Madrid Trademark Application designating Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, the United Kingdom, Israel, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, the Russian Federation and Singapore for the mark ZENTALIS. The portfolio also has pending applications for registration in Argentina, Hong Kong, and Taiwan for the mark ZENTALIS.
Furthermore, we rely upon know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with an employee or a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. To the extent that our commercial partners, 
collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Licensing Agreements and Strategic Collaborations
Recurium IP Holdings, LLC
In December 2014, and as amended and restated effective as of December 2017 and September 2019 and as amended in May 2020, we entered into a license agreement, or the Recurium Agreement, with Recurium IP Holdings, LLC, or Recurium IP under which we were granted an exclusive worldwide license to certain intellectual property rights owned or controlled by Recurium IP to develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products for the treatment or prevention of disease, other than for pain. In connection with the May 2020 amendment, we clarified certain aspects of the sublicensing payment provisions. We have the right to sublicense our rights under the Recurium Agreement, subject to certain conditions. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one product that comprises or contains a licensed compound and to execute certain development activities.
Under the terms of the Recurium Agreement, we are obligated to make development and regulatory milestone payments, pay royalties for net sales and make sublicensing payments with respect to certain licensed products directed to one of ten specific biological targets, including ZN-c5, ZN-c3 and ZN-e4. We are obligated to make development and regulatory milestone payments for such licensed products of up to $44.5 million. In addition, we are obligated to make milestone payments up to $150,000 for certain licensed products used in animals. We are also obligated to pay royalties on sales of such licensed products at a mid- to high-single digit percentage. In addition, if we choose to sublicense or assign to any third parties our rights under the Recurium Agreement with respect to such licensed products, we must pay to Recurium IP 20% of sublicensing income received in connection with such transaction. 
Our royalty obligations will expire on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis on the later of fifteen years from the date of first commercial sale or when there is no longer a valid patent claim covering such licensed product in such country. The Recurium Agreement will expire on the later of on a country-by-country basis the expiration of royalty term for all licensed products in such country and December 21, 2032. The Recurium Agreement may be terminated in its entirety either by Recurium or by us in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party, in the event the other party is subject to specified bankruptcy, insolvency or similar circumstances, or in the event of a force majeure event under certain circumstances.
Upon termination of the Recurium Agreement for any reason, all rights and licenses granted to us under the agreement will terminate and revert to Recurium, and in the event of certain termination events, we would grant Recurium worldwide, royalty-bearing rights to our licensed products and transfer to Recurium any regulatory filings and data for such licensed products.
Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research
In February 2016, and as amended in April 2017 and December 2017, we entered into an option agreement, or the Mayo Agreement, with Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research under which we were granted an exclusive option to obtain a nonexclusive worldwide license to know-how and an exclusive worldwide license to related patent rights created by Mayo under the Mayo Agreement. The Mayo Agreement provided that it will expire on the date of the last to expire of the Mayo patent rights or, if no Mayo patent rights arise, on February 11, 2021. No Mayo patent rights were created under the Mayo Agreement and therefore the agreement expired on February 11, 2021. In consideration for the grant of know-how we provided grants of common stock on the first anniversary and Class A common units on the second and third anniversaries following entry into the Mayo Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, we have granted equity securities which amount to 15,435 shares of common stock under the Mayo Agreement. 
SciClone Pharmaceuticals International (Cayman) Development Ltd.
In December 2014, and as amended in December 2016, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement, or the SciClone Agreement, with SciClone Pharmaceuticals International (Cayman) Development Ltd., or SciClone, under which we granted an exclusive license to certain intellectual property rights in the People’s Republic of China (including the territories of Macao and Hong Kong), South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, or the SciClone Territory, for SciClone to develop and commercialize a licensed product for the treatment or prevention of oncologic diseases and an exclusive option to obtain a similar license for up to two (2) additional licensed products. Under the SciClone Agreement, SciClone is responsible for clinical development activities required in order to obtain regulatory approval in the SciClone Territory. SciClone paid to us a 
one-time up-front payment of $1.0 million upon entering into the SciClone Agreement, and $4.0 million in aggregate milestone payments. No additional development or commercial milestones or reimbursement for research and development expenses are payable under the SciClone Agreement, as amended. We are entitled to receive a mid-single digit royalty on net sales of licensed products in the SciClone Territory, which royalty is subject to certain reductions in the event that SciClone is unable to achieve certain gross margins or if generic products are sold or if technology covering a licensed product is licensed from a third party. We have also agreed to pay SciClone tiered royalties pursuant to the terms of the SciClone Agreement, the applicable rate of which are determined based on whether a compound is developed to a successful dual IND submission and the costs incurred by SciClone for the development of such product candidate. SciClone’s and our royalty obligations will expire on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis on the later of fifteen years from the date of first commercial sale or when there is no longer a valid patent claim covering such licensed product in such country.

Following the December 2016 amendment to the SciClone Agreement, SciClone retains the exclusive license to develop our EGFR inhibitor product candidate, ZN-e4, in the SciClone Territory and the exclusive option to obtain an exclusive license to up to two (2) specified compounds under the SciClone Agreement for which we submit an IND by providing notice and paying $5 million to us. The SciClone Agreement will expire at the later of on a country-by-country basis the expiration of royalty term for all licensed products in such country and 15 years after the effective date of such agreement. The SciClone Agreement may be terminated in its entirety or on a country-by-country basis by SciClone upon 180 days’ notice or either by SciClone or by us in its entirety in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party, in the event the other party is subject to specified bankruptcy, insolvency or similar circumstances, or in the event of a force majeure event under certain circumstances.
Pfizer Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement
In May 2018, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Pfizer, Inc. to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ZN-c5 in combination with their CDK4/6 inhibitor, palbociclib, in our ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ZN-c5. Pursuant to this agreement, we will be responsible for the conduct and cost of the relevant studies, under the supervision of a joint development committee made up of our representatives and representatives of Pfizer that meets quarterly. Pfizer will supply palbociclib for use in the ZN-c5-001 Trial, at no cost to us. We are required to provide to Pfizer clinical data and other reports upon completion of the ZN-c5-001 Trial.
This agreement does not grant any right of first negotiation to participate in future clinical trials, and each of the parties retains all rights and ability to evaluate their respective compounds in any clinical studies, either as monotherapy or in combination with any other product or compound, in any therapeutic area.
The agreement with Pfizer will expire upon completion of all obligations of the parties thereunder or upon termination by either party. We and Pfizer each have the right to terminate the agreement for material breach by the other party. In addition, the agreement may be terminated by either party due to safety considerations or if either party decides to discontinue development of its own compound for medical, scientific, legal or other reasons or if a regulatory authority takes any action preventing that party from supplying its compound for the study. Pfizer also has the right to terminate this agreement if it notifies us in writing that it reasonably and in good faith believes that palbociclib is being used in an unsafe manner, and we fail to incorporate changes to address such issue, and the joint development committee is unable to resolve the issue following elevation to appropriate parties.
Eli Lilly and Company Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement
In July 2020, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Eli Lilly and Company, or Lilly, to evaluate ZN-c5 in combination with their CDK 4/6 inhibitor, abemaciclib, in a planned Phase 1b open label multi-center clinical trial that we intend to initiate in the second half of 2020. Pursuant to this agreement, we will be responsible for the conduct and cost of the relevant studies. We and Lilly will each designate a project manager that will meet no less than twice yearly and will be responsible for implementing and coordinating activities, and facilitating the exchange of information, with respect to the study. Lilly is obligated to supply abemaciclib for use in the trial, at no cost to us. We are required to provide to Lilly clinical data and other reports at major decision points during the trial and no later than 60 days following completion of the planned Phase 1b clinical trial.
This agreement does not grant any right of first negotiation to participate in future clinical trials, and each of the parties retains all rights and ability to evaluate their respective compounds in any clinical studies, either as monotherapy or in combination with any other product or compound, in any therapeutic area.

The agreement with Lilly will expire upon completion of all obligations of the parties thereunder or upon termination by either party. We and Lilly each have the right to terminate the agreement for material breach by the other party. In addition, the agreement may be terminated by either party due to safety considerations or if either party decides to discontinue development of its own compound for medical, scientific, legal or other reasons or if a regulatory authority takes any action preventing that party from supplying its compound for the study. Lilly also has the right to terminate this agreement if it notifies us in writing that it reasonably and in good faith believes that abemaciclib is being used in an unsafe manner, and we fail to incorporate changes to address such issue, and the issue is unable to be resolved following elevation to appropriate parties.
Zentera Therapeutics
In May 2020, each of our subsidiaries Zeno Alpha, Inc., K-Group Alpha, Inc. and K-Group Beta, Inc. entered into a collaboration and license agreement with our majority-owned joint venture, Zentera Therapeutics (Cayman), Ltd., or Zentera (the “Zentera Sublicenses”), pursuant to which we collaborate with Zentera on the development and commercialization of ZN-c5, ZN-d5 and ZN-c3, respectively, whether alone or in a licensed product (“Collaboration Products”) in each case for the treatment or prevention of disease, other than for pain (the “Zentera Field”), in the People’s Republic of China, Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan (the “Zentera Collaboration Territory”). Under each Zentera Sublicense, Zentera will lead development, and upon regulatory approval, the commercialization, of the Collaboration Products in the Zentera Collaboration Territory. On May 19, 2020, Zentera issued an aggregate of 60.2% of its issued shares of common stock to Zeno Alpha, Inc., K-Group Alpha, Inc., K-Group Beta, Inc., Zeno Management, Inc. and Zeno Beta, Inc. Anthony Y. Sun, M.D., our President and Chief Executive Officer, serves as Chief Executive Officer and a member of the board of directors of Zentera and Kevin D. Bunker, Ph.D, our Chief Operating Officer, serves as a member of the board of directors of Zentera.
Under each Zentera Sublicense, we granted Zentera an exclusive, royalty-bearing license under certain of our technology, including technology licensed from Recurium under the Recurium Agreement, to develop and commercialize the Collaboration Products in the Zentera Field and in the Zentera Collaboration Territory, subject to certain rights that we retain, and upon a successful manufacturing transfer, a non-exclusive license under certain of our manufacturing technology to manufacture Collaboration Products in the Zentera Field and in the Zentera Collaboration Territory. Zentera has the right to sublicense its rights under the Zentera Sublicenses subject to certain conditions.
Under the terms of the Zentera Sublicenses, Zentera is responsible for the costs of developing the Collaboration Products in the Zentera Collaboration Territory, and we are responsible for the costs of developing the Collaboration Products outside the Zentera Collaboration Territory, provided that Zentera will reimburse us for a portion of its costs for global data management, pharmacovigilance, safety database management, and chemistry, manufacturing and controls activities with respect to each Collaboration Product. Under the Zentera Sublicenses, we will be eligible to receive future development and regulatory milestones of up to $4.45 million per Collaboration Product. Zentera will pay us royalties on net sales of Collaboration Products in the Zentera Collaboration Territory at a mid- to high-single digit percentage subject to certain reductions. In addition, if Zentera or its affiliate chooses to sublicense or assign to any third parties its rights under the Zentera Sublicenses with respect to any Collaboration Product, Zentera must pay to us 20% of sublicensing income received by Zentera or its affiliates in connection with such transaction.
Zentera’s royalty obligations continue with respect to each region within the Collaboration Territory and each Collaboration Product until the later of (i) the date on which such Collaboration Product is no longer covered by a valid claim of a licensed patent, and (ii) the 15th anniversary of the first commercial sale of such Collaboration Product in such region. Each Zentera Sublicense will expire on a region-by-region basis at the expiration of the royalty term for the Collaboration Product in such region.
Each Zentera Sublicense may be terminated in its entirety either by Zentera or by us in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party, in the event the other party is subject to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar circumstances, or in the event of a force majeure event under certain circumstances. In addition, Zentera may terminate each Zentera Sublicense upon 180 days’ notice to us after the first regulatory approval of the licensed compound in the People’s Republic of China, or if the applicable licensed compound does not achieve regulatory approval in the People’s Republic of China within the timeframe set forth in the initial regional development plan or as otherwise agreed by the parties. We may terminate each Zentera Sublicense if Zentera fails to meet certain diligence obligations under such Zentera Sublicense.
Upon termination of each Zentera Sublicense for any reason, all rights and licenses granted to Zentera under the agreement will terminate and revert to us. In the event of termination, Zentera would assign to us certain intellectual property related to the applicable Collaboration Products and transfer to Zentera any regulatory filings and data for such Collaboration Products, and, in the event of termination by Zentera for convenience, due to a breach by us, or due to our insolvency, we 
would pay Zentera royalties at a mid-single digit percentage on net sales in the Zentera Collaboration Territory of any Collaboration Product for which clinical trial data was generated by Zentera until certain of Zentera’s development, manufacturing and certain commercialization costs accrued, if any, have been reimbursed.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before it may be legally marketed in the United States.
U.S. Drug Development Process
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with FDA’s good laboratory practice requirements and other applicable regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
•approval by an independent IRB ethics committee at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with GCP requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
•submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal trials;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs; and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, a sponsor must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30- day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of 
efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

•Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption,
metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
•Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
•Phase 3: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug.
While the IND is active and before approval, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
U.S. Review and Approval Process
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, preclinical and other non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months 
from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two (2) months to make a “filing” decision after it the application is submitted. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional pivotal Phase 3 trial or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA or, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA with a REMS to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may also require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing development programs.
In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. For example, the FDA has a fast track designation program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product candidate has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development. With regard to a fast track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive Breakthrough Therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers. 
Any product candidate submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a fast track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six (6) months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of new molecular entity NDAs under its current PDUFA review goals.
In addition, a product candidate may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires pre-approval of promotional materials as a condition for accelerated approval, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. 
Post-approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue 
to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;
•clinical holds on clinical studies;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
•consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
•mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
•the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent professional medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion of off-label use and has enjoined companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA and other regulatory agencies have also required that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA-approved labelling.
Marketing Exclusivity
Market exclusivity provisions authorized under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four (4) years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder.
The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of 
reference to any preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six (6) months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances.
Other Healthcare Laws
Pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation, U.S. federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, consumer fraud, pricing reporting, data privacy and security, and transparency laws and regulations as well as similar foreign laws in the jurisdictions outside the U.S. Similar state and local laws and regulations may also restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by patients themselves; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information; state and local laws which require tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to physicians, other healthcare providers and entities or that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and local laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. Violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in penalties, including, without limitation, significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and imprisonment.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of any pharmaceutical product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any newly approved product. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. As a result, the coverage determination process can require manufactures to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of a product to each payor separately and can be a time-consuming process, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. In addition, companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products, will apply to companion diagnostics.
In addition, third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for pharmaceutical products and services. The U.S. government and state legislatures have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors are more and more challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical products, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product.
In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Pharmaceutical products may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products and may also compete with imported foreign products. Furthermore, there is no assurance that a product will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be established even if coverage is available or that the third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect the ability for manufacturers to sell products profitably.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In March 2010, the ACA was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States. By way of example, the ACA increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs, implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, in 2017, Congress enacted the Tax Act, which eliminated the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the case, although it is unclear when a decision will be made or how the Supreme Court will rule. In addition, there may be other efforts to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA. We are continuing to monitor any changes to the ACA that, in turn, may potentially impact our business in the future.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers, which will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, absent additional congressional action. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. The likelihood of success of these and other measures proposed by the previous administration is unclear, particularly in light of the current administration. In addition, individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices.
FDA Approval and Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
If safe and effective use of a therapeutic depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of that diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, if FDA determines that a companion diagnostic device is essential to the safe and effective use of a novel therapeutic product or indication, FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic product or new therapeutic product indication if the companion diagnostic device is not approved or cleared for that indication. Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. The review of in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our therapeutic treatments for cancer will, therefore, likely involve coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health.
Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two (2) primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, or PMA approval.
The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, a PMA application typically requires data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.
PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicant’s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards are not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States.
