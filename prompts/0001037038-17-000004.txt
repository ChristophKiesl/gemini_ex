Item 1. | Business.

General
Founded in 1967 by Mr. Ralph Lauren, we are a global leader in the design, marketing, and distribution of premium lifestyle products, including apparel, accessories, home furnishings, and other licensed product categories. Our long-standing reputation and distinctive image have been developed across an expanding number of products, brands, sales channels, and international markets. We believe that our global reach, breadth of product offerings, and multi-channel distribution are unique among luxury and apparel companies.
We have diversified our business by geography (North America, Europe, and Asia, among other regions) and channels of distribution (wholesale, retail, and licensing). This allows us to maintain a dynamic balance as our operating results do not depend solely on the performance of any single geographic area or channel of distribution. Our wholesale sales are made principally to major department stores and specialty stores around the world. We also sell directly to consumers through our integrated retail channel, which includes our retail stores, concession-based shop-within-shops, and e-commerce operations around the world. In addition, we license to unrelated third parties for specified periods the right to operate retail stores and/or to use our various trademarks in connection with the manufacture and sale of designated products, such as certain apparel, eyewear, fragrances, and home furnishings.
Effective beginning in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017, we organize our business into the following three reportable segments: North America, Europe, and Asia. In addition to these reportable segments, we also have other non-reportable segments. See "Our Segments" for further discussion of our segment reporting structure.
Our global reach is extensive, with merchandise available through our wholesale distribution channels at over 13,000 doors worldwide, the majority in specialty stores. We also sell directly to customers throughout the world via our 466 retail stores and 619 concession-based shop-within-shops, as well as through our various e-commerce sites. In addition to our directly-operated stores and shops, our international licensing partners operate 105 Ralph Lauren stores, 22 Ralph Lauren concession shops, and 136 Club Monaco stores and shops. 
We continue to invest in our business. Over the past five fiscal years, we have invested approximately $1.855 billion for acquisitions and capital improvements, primarily funded through strong operating cash flow. We also continue to return value to our shareholders through our common stock share repurchases and payment of quarterly cash dividends. Over the past five fiscal years, the cost of shares of Class A common stock repurchased pursuant to our common stock repurchase program was approximately $2.177 billion and dividends paid amounted to approximately $770 million.
We have been controlled by the Lauren family since the founding of our Company. As of April 1, 2017, Mr. R. Lauren, or entities controlled by the Lauren family, held approximately 83% of the voting power of the Company's outstanding common stock.

Objectives and Opportunities
We believe that our size and the global scope of our operations provide us with design, sourcing, and distribution synergies across our different businesses. Our core strengths include a portfolio of global premium lifestyle brands, a strong record of developing and extending the distribution of our brands through multiple channels in global markets, an investment philosophy supported by a strong balance sheet, and an experienced management team. Despite the various risks and uncertainties associated with the current global economic environment, as discussed further in Item 7 — "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Current Trends and Outlook," we believe our core strengths will allow us to execute our long-term growth strategy.
In connection with our Way Forward Plan (as described in "Recent Developments"), we have developed a long-term growth strategy with the objective of delivering sustainable, profitable growth and long-term value creation for shareholders. Our growth strategy is comprised of the following key strategic initiatives:

• | Evolve our brand strategy, with the consumer in the center and a greater focus on our core brands;


• | Refocus and evolve the product, marketing, and shopping experience to increase desirability and relevance;


• | Develop a systematic and repeatable way of building a stronger assortment;


• | Develop a demand-driven supply chain;


• | Develop best-in-class sourcing to optimize quality, cost, speed, and flexibility;


• | Develop a disciplined multi-channel distribution and expansion strategy that strengthens the brand and drives high quality growth;


• | Rightsize our cost structure and develop a disciplined return on investment-driven financial model; and


• | Continue to strengthen our leadership team and culture.

Recent Developments
Change in Chief Executive Officer
Consistent with our announcement on February 2, 2017, Mr. Stefan Larsson departed as the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and as a member of our Board of Directors, effective as of May 1, 2017. Subsequently, on May 17, 2017, we announced that Mr. Patrice Louvet will be appointed as the Company's new President and CEO and as a member of our Board of Directors, effective as of July 10, 2017 or such date as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties. See Note 22 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the appointment of Mr. Louvet.
In connection with Mr. Larsson's departure, we recorded other charges of $11.4 million during Fiscal 2017 and expect to incur additional charges of approximately $6 million during Fiscal 2018. See Note 10 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding Mr. Larsson's departure.
Way Forward Plan
On June 2, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan with the objective of delivering sustainable, profitable sales growth and long-term value creation for shareholders (the "Way Forward Plan"). We plan to refocus on our core brands and evolve our product, marketing, and shopping experience to increase desirability and relevance. We also intend to evolve our operating model to enable sustainable, profitable sales growth by significantly improving quality of sales, reducing supply chain lead times, improving our sourcing, and executing a disciplined multi-channel distribution and expansion strategy. As part of the Way Forward Plan, we plan to rightsize our cost structure and implement a return on investment-driven financial model to free up resources to invest in the brand and drive high-quality sales. The Way Forward Plan includes strengthening our leadership team and creating a more nimble organization by moving from an average of nine to six layers of management. The Way Forward Plan also includes the discontinuance of our Denim & Supply brand and the integration of our denim product offerings into our Polo Ralph Lauren brand. Collectively, these actions resulted in a reduction in workforce and the closure of certain stores and shop-within-shops during Fiscal 2017, and are expected to result in gross annualized expense savings of approximately $180 million to $220 million.

On March 30, 2017, our Board of Directors approved the following additional restructuring-related activities associated with our Way Forward Plan: (i) the restructuring of our in-house global e-commerce platform which was in development and shift to a more cost-effective, flexible e-commerce platform through a new agreement with Salesforce's Commerce Cloud, formerly known as Demandware; (ii) the closure of our Polo store at 711 Fifth Avenue in New York City; and (iii) the further streamlining of the organization and the execution of other key corporate actions in line with our Way Forward Plan. These actions, which are expected to be completed by the end of Fiscal 2018, are an important part of our efforts to achieve our stated objective to return to sustainable, profitable growth and invest in the future. These additional restructuring-related activities will result in a further reduction in workforce and the closure of certain corporate office and store locations, and are expected to result in additional gross annualized expense savings of approximately $140 million. 
In connection with the Way Forward Plan, we currently expect to incur total estimated charges of approximately $770 million, comprised of cash-related restructuring charges of approximately $450 million and non-cash charges of approximately $320 million. Cumulative cash and non-cash charges incurred during Fiscal 2017 were $289.1 million and $277.3 million, respectively. In addition to these charges, we also incurred an additional non-cash charge of $155.2 million during Fiscal 2017 associated with the destruction of inventory out of current liquidation channels in line with our Way Forward Plan. See Notes 9 and 10 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for detailed discussions of the charges recorded in connection with the Way Forward Plan.

Our Segments
Prior to the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017, we organized our business into the following three reportable segments: wholesale, retail, and licensing. In connection with the Way Forward Plan, we have implemented significant organizational changes that have impacted the manner in which we manage the Company. Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017, we realigned our business into the following three reportable segments:

• | North America — Our North America segment, representing approximately 57% of our Fiscal 2017 net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our Ralph Lauren branded apparel, accessories, home furnishings, and related products made through our wholesale and retail businesses in the U.S. and Canada, which include 7,294 wholesale doors, 46 Ralph Lauren stores, 170 factory stores, and our e-commerce site, www.RalphLauren.com.


• | Europe — Our Europe segment, representing approximately 23% of our Fiscal 2017 net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our Ralph Lauren branded apparel, accessories, home furnishings, and related products made through our wholesale and retail businesses in Europe and the Middle East, which include 5,690 wholesale doors, 21 Ralph Lauren stores, 61 factory stores, 31 concession-based shop-within-shops, and various e-commerce sites.


• | Asia — Our Asia segment, representing approximately 13% of our Fiscal 2017 net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our Ralph Lauren branded apparel, accessories, home furnishings, and related products made through our wholesale and retail businesses in Asia, Australia, and New Zealand, which include 187 wholesale doors, 42 Ralph Lauren stores, 47 factory stores, 586 concession-based shop-within-shops, and various third-party digital partner e-commerce sites. 


8

No operating segments were aggregated to form our reportable segments. In addition to these reportable segments, we also have other non-reportable segments, representing approximately 7% of our Fiscal 2017 net revenues, which primarily consist of (i) sales of our Club Monaco branded products made through our retail businesses in the U.S., Canada, and Europe, (ii) sales of our Ralph Lauren branded products made through our wholesale business in Latin America, and (iii) royalty revenues earned through our global licensing alliances. 
This new segment structure is consistent with how we establish our overall business strategy, allocate resources, and assess performance of our Company. All prior period segment information has been recast to reflect the realignment of our segment reporting structure on a comparable basis.
Approximately 40% of our Fiscal 2017 net revenues were earned outside of the U.S. See Note 20 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of net revenues and operating income by segment, as well as net revenues and long-lived assets by geographic location.
Our Wholesale Business
Our wholesale business sells our products globally to leading upscale and certain mid-tier department stores, specialty stores, and golf and pro shops. We have continued to focus on elevating our brand by improving in-store product assortment and presentation, as well as full-price sell-throughs to consumers. As of the end of Fiscal 2017, our wholesale products were sold through over 13,000 doors worldwide, with the majority in specialty stores. Our products are also sold through the e-commerce sites of certain of our wholesale customers.
The primary product offerings sold through our wholesale channels of distribution include apparel, accessories, and home furnishings. Our luxury brands — Ralph Lauren Collection and Ralph Lauren Purple Label — are distributed worldwide through a limited number of premier fashion retailers. Department stores are our major wholesale customers in North America. In Latin America, our wholesale products are sold in department stores and specialty stores. In Europe, our wholesale sales are comprised of a varying mix of sales to both department stores and specialty stores, depending on the country. In Asia, our wholesale products are distributed primarily through shop-within-shops at department stores. We also distribute our wholesale products to certain licensed stores operated by our partners in Latin America, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.
We sell the majority of our excess and out-of-season products through secondary distribution channels worldwide, including our retail factory stores.

Shop-within-Shops.    As a critical element of our distribution to department stores, we and our licensing partners utilize shop-within-shops to enhance brand recognition, to permit more complete merchandising of our lines by the department stores, and to differentiate the presentation of our products. 
The following table presents the number of shop-within-shops by segment as of April 1, 2017:

 | Shop-within-Shops
North America | 16,970

The size of our shop-within-shops ranges from approximately 100 to 9,200 square feet. Shop-within-shop fixed assets primarily include items such as customized freestanding fixtures, wall cases and components, decorative items, and flooring. We normally share in the cost of building out these shop-within-shops with our wholesale customers. 
Basic Stock Replenishment Program.    Basic products such as knit shirts, chino pants, oxford cloth shirts, select accessories, and home products can be ordered by our wholesale customers at any time through our basic stock replenishment program. We generally ship these products within two to five days of order receipt.
Our Retail Business
Our retail business sells directly to customers throughout the world via our 466 retail stores, totaling approximately 3.7 million square feet, and 619 concession-based shop-within-shops, as well as through our various e-commerce sites. We operate our retail business using an omni-channel retailing strategy that seeks to deliver an integrated shopping experience with a consistent message of our brands and products to our customers, regardless of whether they are shopping for our products in one of our physical stores or online.
Ralph Lauren Stores
Our Ralph Lauren stores feature a broad range of apparel, accessories, watch and jewelry, fragrance, and home product assortments in an atmosphere reflecting the distinctive attitude and image of the Ralph Lauren, Polo, and Double RL brands, including exclusive merchandise that is not sold in department stores. During Fiscal 2017, we opened six new Ralph Lauren stores and closed 41 stores. Our Ralph Lauren stores are primarily situated in major upscale street locations and upscale regional malls, generally in large urban markets.

Our Ralph Lauren stores range in size from approximately 700 to 37,900 square feet.

Factory Stores
We extend our reach to additional consumer groups through our 278 factory stores worldwide, which are principally located in major outlet centers. Our worldwide factory stores offer selections of our apparel, accessories, and fragrances. In addition to these product offerings, certain of our factory stores in North America offer home furnishings. During Fiscal 2017, we opened 14 new factory stores and closed eight factory stores.
The following table presents the number of factory stores by segment as of April 1, 2017:

Our factory stores range in size from approximately 1,400 to 26,700 square feet. Factory stores obtain products from our suppliers, our product licensing partners, and our other retail stores and e-commerce operations, and also serve as a secondary distribution channel for our excess and out-of-season products.
Concession-based Shop-within-Shops
The terms of trade for shop-within-shops are largely conducted on a concession basis, whereby inventory continues to be owned by us (not the department store) until ultimate sale to the end consumer. The salespeople involved in the sales transactions are generally our employees and not those of the department store.
The following table presents the number of concession-based shop-within-shops by segment as of April 1, 2017:

In Asia, we sell products online through e-commerce sites of various third-party digital partners.
Our Ralph Lauren e-commerce sites offer our customers access to a broad array of Ralph Lauren, Polo, and Double RL apparel, accessories, watch and jewelry, fragrance, and home product assortments, and reinforce the luxury image of our brands. While investing in e-commerce operations remains a primary focus, it is an extension of our investment in the integrated omni-channel strategy used to operate our overall retail business, in which our e-commerce operations are interdependent with our physical stores. 
Our Club Monaco e-commerce sites offer our domestic and Canadian customers access to our global assortment of Club Monaco apparel and accessories product lines, as well as select online exclusives. 
Our Licensing Business
Through licensing alliances, we combine our consumer insight, design, and marketing skills with the specific product or geographic competencies of our licensing partners to create and build new businesses. We generally seek out licensing partners who are leaders in their respective markets, contribute the majority of the product development costs, provide the operational infrastructure required to support the business, and own the inventory. Our licensing business has been aggregated with other non-reportable segments.
Product Licensing
We grant our product licensees the right to manufacture and sell at wholesale specified categories of products under one or more of our trademarks. Each product licensing partner pays us royalties based upon its sales of our products, generally subject to a minimum royalty requirement for the right to use our trademarks and design services. In addition, our licensing partners may be required to allocate a portion of their revenues to advertising our products and sharing in the creative costs associated with these products. Larger allocations typically are required in connection with launches of new products or in new territories. Our license agreements generally have one to five-year terms and may grant the licensees conditional renewal options.
We work closely with all of our licensing partners to ensure that their products are developed, marketed, and distributed to reach the intended consumer and are presented consistently across product categories to convey the distinctive identity and lifestyle associated with our brands. Virtually all aspects of the design, production quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising, and promotion of Ralph Lauren products are subject to our prior approval and continuing oversight. We perform a broader range of services for most of our Ralph Lauren Home licensing partners than we do for our other licensing partners, including design, operating showrooms, marketing, and advertising.
The following table lists our largest licensing agreements as of April 1, 2017. Except as noted in the table, these product licenses cover North America only.

Category | Licensed Products | Licensing Partners 
Men's Apparel | Underwear and Sleepwear | Hanesbrands, Inc. (includes Japan) 
 | Chaps, Lauren, and Ralph Tailored Clothing | Peerless Clothing International, Inc. 
Beauty Products | Fragrances, Cosmetics, Color, and Skin Care | L'Oreal S.A. (global) 
Accessories | Eyewear | Luxottica Group, S.p.A. (global) 
Home(a) | Bedding and Bath | Ichida Co., Ltd. and Kohl's Illinois, Inc. 
 | Utility and Blankets | Hollander Sleep Products LLC, Ichida Co., Ltd., and Kohl's Illinois, Inc.

(a) | Our Home products are sold under our Ralph Lauren Home, Lauren Ralph Lauren, and Chaps Home brands. As of April 1, 2017, we had agreements with 10 Home product licensing partners.


12

International Licensing
We believe that international markets offer additional opportunities for our iconic designs and lifestyle image. Our international licensing partners acquire the right to sell, promote, market, and/or distribute various categories of our products in a given geographic area and source products from us, our product licensing partners, and independent sources. The international licensees' rights may include the right to own and operate retail stores. As of April 1, 2017, our international licensing partners operated 105 Ralph Lauren stores, 22 Ralph Lauren concession shops, and 136 Club Monaco stores and shops. 
Seasonality of Business
Our business is typically affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of wholesale sales in our second and fourth fiscal quarters and higher retail sales in our second and third fiscal quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and key vacation travel, back-to-school, and holiday shopping periods impacting our retail business. As a result of growth and other changes in our business, along with changes in consumer spending patterns and the macroeconomic environment, historical quarterly operating trends and working capital requirements may not be indicative of our future performance. In addition, fluctuations in sales, operating income, and cash flows in any fiscal quarter may be affected by other events affecting retail sales, such as changes in weather patterns.
Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working capital requirements typically increase during the first half of the fiscal year as inventory builds to support peak shipping/selling periods and, accordingly, typically decrease during the second half of the fiscal year as inventory is shipped/sold. Cash provided by operating activities is typically higher in the second half of the fiscal year due to reduced working capital requirements during that period.
Product Design
Our products reflect a timeless and innovative interpretation of American style with a strong international appeal. Our consistent emphasis on new and distinctive design has been an important contributor to the prominence, strength, and reputation of the Ralph Lauren brands.
Our Ralph Lauren products are designed by, and under the direction of, Mr. Ralph Lauren and our design staff. We form design teams around our brands and product categories to develop concepts, themes, and products for each brand and category. Through close collaboration with merchandising, sales, and production staff, these teams support all of our businesses in order to gain market information and other valuable input.
Marketing and Advertising
Our marketing and advertising programs communicate the themes and images of our brands and are integral to the success of our product offerings. The majority of our advertising program is created and executed by our in-house creative and advertising agency to ensure consistency of presentation, which is complemented by our marketing experts in each region who help to execute our international strategies.
We create distinctive image advertising for our brands, conveying the particular message of each one within the context of the overall Ralph Lauren aesthetic. Advertisements generally portray a lifestyle rather than a specific item and include a variety of products offered by ourselves and, in some cases, our licensing partners. Our communication campaigns are primarily executed through a combination of print, outdoor, digital, and social media platforms, and, to a lesser extent, through television and cinema. 
Our digital advertising programs focus on high impact and innovative digital media outlets, which allow us to convey our key brand messages and lifestyle positioning. We also develop digital editorial initiatives that allow for deeper education and engagement around the Ralph Lauren lifestyle, including the RL Magazine, RL Style Guide, and a wide array of video and social media content. We deploy these marketing and advertising initiatives through online, mobile, email, and social media. Our e-commerce sites present the Ralph Lauren lifestyle online, while offering a broad array of our apparel, accessories, and home product lines.

We advertise in consumer and trade print and digital media, and participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with some of our retail and licensing partners. We also provide point-of-sale fixtures and signage to our wholesale customers to enhance the presentation of our products at their retail locations. In addition, when our licensing partners are required to spend an amount equal to a percentage of their licensed product sales on advertising, we coordinate the advertising placement on their behalf. We believe our investments in shop-within-shop environments and retail stores, including our global flagship locations, contribute to and enhance the themes of our brands to consumers. Advertising and marketing expenses amounted to $219.9 million, $280.0 million, and $274.6 million in Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2016, and Fiscal 2015, respectively. In Fiscal 2017, reductions in promotional programs, store count, and marketing staffing drove substantial savings in comparison to the prior fiscal year.
We also conduct a variety of public relations activities. Each spring and fall, our Ralph Lauren Women's Collection is presented during New York Fashion Week. We also introduce each of the spring and fall menswear and womenswear collections at press presentations in major cities such as New York City and Milan. These fashion events, in addition to celebrity red carpet dressing moments, model appearances, and events hosted in our stores and restaurants, including The Polo Bar in New York City, generate extensive domestic and international media and social coverage.
We continue to be the official outfitter for all on-court officials at both the Wimbledon and the U.S. Open tennis tournaments. Both tournaments provide worldwide exposure for our brand in a relevant lifestyle environment. We also continue to be the exclusive Official Parade Outfitter for the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Teams, with the right to manufacture, distribute, advertise, promote, and sell products in the U.S. which replicate the Parade Outfits and associated leisure wear. Most recently, we dressed Team U.S.A. for the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. As part of our involvement with Team U.S.A., we have established a partnership with athletes serving as brand ambassadors and as the faces of our advertising, marketing, and public relations campaigns. Additionally, under our agreement with the United States Golf Association ("USGA"), we continue to be the official apparel outfitter for the USGA and the U.S. Open Championships and serve as the championship's largest on-site apparel supplier. 
We believe our partnerships with such prestigious global athletic events reinforce our brand's sporting heritage in a truly authentic way and serve to connect our Company and brands to our consumers through their individual areas of passion.
Sourcing, Production and Quality
We contract for the manufacture of our products and do not own or operate any production facilities. Approximately 600 different manufacturers worldwide produce our apparel, accessories, and home products, with no one manufacturer providing more than 4% of our total production during Fiscal 2017. We source both finished products and raw materials. Raw materials include fabric, buttons, and other trim. Finished products consist of manufactured and fully assembled products ready for shipment to our customers. In Fiscal 2017, over 97% of our products (by dollar value) were produced outside of the U.S., primarily in Asia, Europe, and Latin America. See "Import Restrictions and Other Government Regulations" and Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Our business is subject to risks associated with importing products and could suffer as a result of increases in the price of raw materials, freight, or labor; or a manufacturer's inability to produce our goods on time and to our specifications."
Most of our businesses must commit to the manufacturing of our garments before we sell finished goods, whether to wholly-owned retail stores or to wholesale customers. We also must commit to the purchase of fabric from mills well in advance of our sales. If we overestimate our primary customers' demand for a particular product or the need for a particular fabric or yarn, we primarily sell the excess products or garments made from such fabric or yarn in our factory stores or through other secondary distribution channels.
Suppliers operate under the close supervision of our global manufacturing division and buying agents headquartered in Asia, the Americas, the Middle East, and Europe. All products are produced according to our specifications and standards. Production and quality control staff in Asia, the Americas, the Middle East, and Europe monitor manufacturing at supplier facilities in order to correct problems prior to shipment of the final product. Procedures have been implemented under our vendor certification and compliance programs so that quality assurance is reviewed early in the production process, allowing merchandise to be received at the distribution facilities and shipped to customers with minimal interruption.

Competition
Competition is very strong in the segments of the fashion and consumer product industries in which we operate. We compete with numerous designers and manufacturers of apparel and accessories, fragrances, and home furnishing products, both domestic and international. We also face increasing competition from companies selling our product categories through the Internet. Some of our competitors may be significantly larger and have substantially greater resources than us. We compete primarily on the basis of fashion, quality, value, and service, which depend on our ability to:

• | anticipate and respond to changing consumer demands in a timely manner;


• | create and maintain favorable brand recognition, loyalty, and reputation for quality;


• | develop and produce high quality products that appeal to consumers;


• | competitively price our products and create an acceptable value proposition for consumers;


• | provide strong and effective marketing support;


• | source raw materials at cost-effective prices;


• | anticipate and maintain proper inventory levels;


• | ensure product availability and optimize supply chain and distribution efficiencies; and


• | obtain additional points of distribution and sufficient retail floor space, and effectively present our products to consumers.

See Item 1A — "Risk Factors — We face intense competition worldwide in the markets in which we operate."
Distribution
To facilitate global distribution, our products are shipped from manufacturers to a network of distribution centers around the world for inspection, sorting, packing, and delivery to our retail locations and e-commerce and wholesale customers. This network includes the following primary distribution facilities:

Facility Location | Geographic Region Serviced | FacilityOwnership
Greensboro, North Carolina | U.S. | Owned 
N. Pendleton Street, High Point, North Carolina | U.S. | Owned 
NC Highway 66, High Point, North Carolina | U.S. | Leased 
Eagle Hill Drive, High Point, North Carolina | U.S. | Leased 
Chino Hills, California | U.S. | Third-party 
Miami, Florida | U.S. | Third-party 
Toronto, Ontario | Canada | Third-party 
Parma, Italy | Europe | Third-party 
Yokohama, Japan | Japan | Third-party 
Bugok, South Korea | South Korea | Leased 
Tuen Mun, Hong Kong | Greater China and Southeast Asia(a) | Third-party 
Colón, Panama | Latin America | Third-party 


(a) | Includes Australia, China, Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam.

All facilities are designed to allow for high-density cube storage and value-added services, and utilize unit and carton tracking technology to facilitate process control and inventory management. The distribution network is managed through globally integrated information technology systems.

Management Information Systems
Our management information systems make the design, marketing, manufacturing, importation, and distribution of our products more efficient by providing, among other things:

• | comprehensive order processing;


• | production and design information;


• | accounting information; and


• | an enterprise view of information for our design, marketing, manufacturing, importing, and distribution functions.

The point-of-sale registers, in conjunction with other systems in our stores, enable us to track inventory from store receipt to final sale on a real-time basis. We believe our merchandising and financial systems, coupled with our point-of-sale registers and software programs, allow for efficient stock replenishment, effective merchandise planning, and real-time inventory and sales accounting. 
In the U.S. and Europe, we utilize an automated replenishment system to facilitate the processing of basic stock replenishment orders from our retail business and wholesale customers, the movement of goods through distribution channels, and the collection of information for planning and forecasting purposes. In the U.S. and Europe, we also utilize an automated allocation system to facilitate the flow of inventory for our retail business.
We recently completed the implementation of a global operating and financial reporting information technology system, SAP, as part of a multi-year plan to integrate and upgrade our systems and processes. We substantially completed the migration of our North America operations to SAP during Fiscal 2015, and the migration of our Europe operations to SAP was completed during the first quarter of Fiscal 2018. In addition to implementing SAP, we also completed the migration of our North America and Europe operations to a new procure-to-pay platform during Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2017, respectively. Further, we have plans to transition our e-commerce operations to a third-party cloud-based platform during Fiscal 2018.
See Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Risk and uncertainties associated with the implementation of information systems may negatively impact our business," "Risk Factors — A data security or privacy breach could damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers or employees, expose us to litigation risk, and adversely affect our business," and "Risk Factors — Our business could suffer if our computer systems and websites are disrupted or cease to operate effectively."
Wholesale Credit Control
We manage our own credit function. We sell our merchandise principally to major department stores and extend credit based on an evaluation of the wholesale customer's financial capacity and condition, usually without requiring collateral. We monitor credit levels and the financial condition of our wholesale customers on a continuing basis to minimize credit risk. We do not factor or underwrite our accounts receivables, or maintain credit insurance to manage the risk of bad debts. In North America, collection and deduction transactional activities are provided through a third-party service provider. See Item 1A — "Risk Factors — A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a limited number of large wholesale customers. Our business could suffer as a result of consolidations, liquidations, restructurings, other ownership changes in the retail industry, and/or any financial instability of our large wholesale customers."

16

Wholesale Backlog
We generally receive wholesale orders approximately three to five months prior to the time the products are delivered to customers, with the exception of orders received through our basic stock replenishment program, which ship within two to five days of order receipt. Our wholesale orders are generally subject to broad cancellation rights. 
The following table presents our wholesale backlog by segment as of April 1, 2017 and April 2, 2016: 

 | April 1, 2017 | | April 2, 2016
 | (billions) 
North America | $ | 0.8 | | | $ | 1.0
Europe | 0.4 | | | 0.4 | 
Total | $ | 1.2 | | | $ | 1.4

We expect that substantially all of our backlog orders as of April 1, 2017 will be filled within the next fiscal year.
The size of our order backlog depends upon a number of factors, including the timing of the market weeks for our particular lines during which a significant percentage of our orders are received and the timing of shipments, which varies from year-to-year with consideration for holidays, consumer trends, concept plans, and the basic stock replenishment program's usage. As a consequence, a comparison of the size of our order backlog from period-to-period may not be meaningful, nor may it be indicative of eventual shipments.
Trademarks
We own the RALPH LAUREN, POLO, POLO BY RALPH LAUREN DESIGN, and the famous polo player astride a horse trademarks in the U.S. and approximately 120 countries worldwide. Other trademarks that we own include:

• | PURPLE LABEL;


• | DOUBLE RL;


• | RRL;


• | RLX;


• | LAUREN RALPH LAUREN;


• | PINK PONY;


• | LAUREN;


• | RALPH;


• | CHAPS;


• | CLUB MONACO; and


• | Various other trademarks, including those pertaining to fragrances and cosmetics.

Mr. Ralph Lauren has the royalty-free right to use as trademarks RALPH LAUREN, DOUBLE RL, and RRL in perpetuity in connection with, among other things, beef and living animals. The trademarks DOUBLE RL and RRL are currently used by the Double RL Company, an entity wholly owned by Mr. R. Lauren. In addition, Mr. R. Lauren has the right to engage in personal projects involving film or theatrical productions (not including or relating to our business) through RRL Productions, Inc., a company wholly owned by Mr. R. Lauren. Any activity by these companies has no impact on us.

17

Our trademarks are the subject of registrations and pending applications throughout the world for use on a variety of items of apparel, apparel-related products, home furnishings, restaurant and café services, online services and online publications, and beauty products, as well as in connection with retail services, and we continue to expand our worldwide usage and registration of related trademarks. In general, trademarks remain valid and enforceable as long as the marks are used in connection with the related products and services and the required registration renewals are filed. We regard the license to use the trademarks and our other proprietary rights in and to the trademarks as extremely valuable assets in marketing our products and, on a worldwide basis, vigorously seek to protect them against infringement. As a result of the appeal of our trademarks, our products have been the object of counterfeiting. While we have a broad enforcement program which has been generally effective in protecting our intellectual property rights and limiting the sale of counterfeit products in the U.S. and in most major markets abroad, we face greater challenges with respect to enforcing our rights against trademark infringement in certain parts of Asia.
In markets outside of the U.S., our rights to some or all of our trademarks may not be clearly established. In the course of our international expansion, we have experienced conflicts with various third parties who have acquired ownership rights in certain trademarks, including POLO and/or a representation of a Polo Player Design, which impede our use and registration of our principal trademarks. While such conflicts are common and may arise again from time to time as we continue our international expansion, we have, in general, successfully resolved such conflicts in the past through both legal action and negotiated settlements with third-party owners of the conflicting marks (see Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected outside the U.S." and Item 3 — "Legal Proceedings" for further discussion). Although we have not suffered any material restraints or restrictions on doing business in desirable markets in the past, we cannot assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and introduce trademarks to new markets.
Import Restrictions and Other Government Regulations
Virtually all of our merchandise imported into the Americas, Europe, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand is subject to duties. In addition, most of the countries to which we ship could impose safeguard quotas and duties to protect their local industries from import surges that threaten to create market disruption. The U.S. and other countries may also unilaterally impose additional duties in response to a particular product being imported (from China or other countries) at unfairly traded prices in such increased quantities that would cause (or threaten) injury to the relevant domestic industry (generally known as "anti-dumping" actions). If dumping is suspected in the U.S., the U.S. government may self-initiate a dumping case on behalf of the U.S. textile industry which could significantly affect our costs. Furthermore, additional duties, generally known as countervailing duties, can also be imposed by the U.S. government to offset subsidies provided by a foreign government to foreign manufacturers if the importation of such subsidized merchandise injures or threatens to injure a U.S. industry. Legislative proposals have been introduced which, if adopted, would treat a manipulation by China of the value of its currency as actionable under the anti-dumping or countervailing duty laws.
In addition, each of the countries in which our products are sold has laws and regulations covering imports. Because the U.S. and the other countries in which our products are manufactured and sold may, from time to time, impose new duties, tariffs, surcharges, or other import controls or restrictions, including the imposition of a "safeguard quota," or adjust presently prevailing duty or tariff rates or levels, we maintain a program of intensive monitoring of import restrictions and opportunities. We seek to minimize our potential exposure to import-related risks through, among other measures, adjustments in product design and fabrication, shifts of production among countries and manufacturers, and through geographical diversification of our sources of supply.
As almost all of our products are manufactured by foreign suppliers, the enactment of new legislation or the administration of current international trade regulations or executive action affecting textile agreements, or changes in sourcing patterns could adversely affect our operations. See Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Our ability to conduct business globally may be affected by a variety of legal, regulatory, political, and economic risks" and "Risk Factors — Our business is subject to risks associated with importing products and could suffer as a result of increases in the price of raw materials, freight, or labor; or a manufacturer's inability to produce our goods on time and to our specifications."
We are also subject to other international trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Central American Free Trade Agreement, the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement, the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement, the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement and other special trade preference programs. A portion of our imported products are eligible for certain of these duty-advantaged programs. Apparel and other products sold by us are under the jurisdiction of multiple governmental agencies, including, in the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Consumer Products Safety Commission. 

18

Our products are also subject to regulation in the U.S. and other countries, including the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, which imposes limitations on the permissible amounts of lead and phthalates allowed in children's products. These regulations relate principally to product labeling, licensing requirements, and consumer product safety requirements and regulatory testing, particularly with respect to products used by children. Any failure to comply with such requirements could result in significant penalties and require us to recall products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these regulations, as well as applicable federal, state, local, and foreign rules and regulations governing the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment. We do not anticipate any significant capital expenditures for environmental control matters either in the next fiscal year or in the near future. Our licensed products, licensing partners, buying/sourcing agents, and the vendors and factories with which we contract for the manufacture and distribution of our products are also subject to regulation. Our agreements require our licensing partners, buying/sourcing agents, vendors, and factories to operate in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and we are not aware of any violations which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results.
We are also subject to disclosure and reporting requirements, established under existing or new federal or state laws, such as the requirements to identify the origin and existence of certain "conflict minerals" under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and disclosures of specific actions to eradicate abusive labor practices in our supply chain under the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act. While we require our suppliers to operate in compliance with all applicable laws and our operating guidelines which promote ethical and socially responsible business practices, any violation of labor, environmental, health, and safety or other laws, or any divergence by an independent supplier's labor practices from generally accepted industry standards, could damage our reputation, disrupt our sourcing capabilities, and increase the cost of doing business, adversely affecting our results of operations. See Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Our business could suffer if we fail to comply with labor laws or if one of our manufacturers fails to use acceptable labor or environmental practices."
Although we have not suffered any material restriction from doing business in desirable markets in the past, we cannot assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and introduce additional trademarks to new markets.
Employees
As of April 1, 2017, we had approximately 23,300 employees, comprised of approximately 13,200 full-time and approximately 10,100 part-time employees. Approximately 12,800 of our employees are located in the U.S. and approximately 10,500 are located in foreign countries. Approximately 25 of our U.S. production employees in the womenswear business are members of Workers United (which was previously known as UNITE HERE) under an industry association collective bargaining agreement, which our womenswear subsidiary has adopted. We consider our relations with both our union and non-union employees to be good.
