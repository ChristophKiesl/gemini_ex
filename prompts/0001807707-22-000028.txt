Item 1. Business
Overview
We were founded on January 19, 2018. Together with our subsidiaries, we are an applied agricultural technology company in Appalachia developing and operating some of the world’s largest high-tech indoor farms, which are designed to grow non-GMO produce, free of or with minimal chemical pesticide residues, use primarily rainwater, and produce significantly higher yields than those yields achieved by traditional agriculture on the same amount of land. We combine conventional agricultural techniques with cutting-edge technology, including artificial intelligence and robotics, to improve access to nutritious food, farming more sustainably, building a domestic food supply, and increasing investment in Appalachia.
On January 29, 2021, AppHarvest Operations, Inc. (f/k/a AppHarvest, Inc., “Legacy AppHarvest”), a Delaware public benefit corporation, Novus Capital Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Novus”), ORGA, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Novus (“Merger Sub”), consummated the closing of the transactions contemplated by a Business Combination Agreement, dated September 2020 (the “Business Combination Agreement”), following the approval at a special meeting of the stockholders of Novus held on January 29, 2021. Pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, a Business Combination of Legacy AppHarvest and Novus was effected through the merger of Legacy AppHarvest with and into Merger Sub, with Legacy AppHarvest surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Novus (the “Business Combination”). On the closing date, Legacy AppHarvest changed its name to AppHarvest Operations, Inc. and Novus changed its name from Novus Capital Corporation to AppHarvest, Inc. 
We are also committed to the communities where we operate by providing compelling, long-term career opportunities to the local workforce as well as partnering with educational institutions, such as the University of Kentucky and local high schools and technical schools, to create programs that benefit students, researchers, and our own operations. At AppHarvest, our goal is to lay the foundation for Appalachia to become the AgTech capital of North America.
Our commitment to Appalachia is driven by the personal connection of AppHarvest’s leadership, including Jonathan Webb, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, to the area. As a proud Kentucky native, Mr. Webb has developed deep relationships within the Appalachian community that include civic leaders, strategic vendors and suppliers, and local and state elected officials. Our deep connection to the local community has been instrumental in facilitating our growth and development.
AppHarvest also has a refined geographic strategy in place designed to impart immediate as well as long-term benefits. Central Appalachia presents multiple strategic advantages for AppHarvest, including access to an abundant and hard-working labor force, beneficial climate patterns that allow all, or substantially all, of our water requirements to be supplied naturally by rainfall, and geographic proximity to approximately 70% of all U.S. households within a one-day drive.
AppHarvest is a mission-driven organization with an ethos rooted in sustainability and environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) principles. Our leadership team and employees share a deeply-held belief that, as an organization, we are responsible to multiple stakeholders, including our workers, our community, our customers, our environment, and our stockholders. AppHarvest is a public benefit corporation, which underscores our commitment to our mission and stakeholders. In addition, we elected to have our social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency assessed against the proprietary criteria established by an independent non-profit organization. As a result of this assessment, AppHarvest was designated as a Certified B Corporation in December 2019. As of December 31, 2021, we are one of less than ten publicly traded Certified B Corporations in the United States. 
Prior to October 2020, our operations were limited to the “start-up” concerns of organizing and staffing, business planning, raising capital, and acquiring and developing properties for Controlled Environment Agriculture (“CEA”). In October 2020, we partially opened our first CEA facility in Morehead, Kentucky (the “Morehead CEA facility”), which we estimate can cultivate approximately 720,000 tomato plants with an approximate yield of 40 million pounds per year. We harvested our first crop of beefsteak tomatoes and tomatoes on the vine in January 2021 and March 2021, respectively. In May 2021, we opened production of the full 60 acres at the Morehead CEA facility and, in August 2021, concluded the first harvest. We completed planting of our second crop at the Morehead CEA facility in September 2021, and began harvest of the crop in the fourth quarter of 2021.
We have begun construction on four more CEA facilities. Two of the facilities under construction are located in Berea, Kentucky (the “Berea salad greens facility”) and Richmond, Kentucky (the “Richmond tomato facility”). As of the date hereof, construction on the Berea salad greens facility is approximately 68% complete; the Richmond tomato facility is approximately 65% complete. Both CEA facilities are expected to be fully operational by the end of 2022.
Groundbreakings for two more CEA facilities occurred in June 2021 in Somerset, Kentucky (the “Somerset facility”) and Morehead, Kentucky (the “Morehead salad greens facility”). The Somerset facility is intended to grow berries, and the Morehead salad greens facility, which is located adjacent to the Morehead CEA facility, is intended to grow salad greens. The Somerset facility is approximately 55% complete and expected to be operational by the end of 2022.
To incorporate design and other insights we gained from construction of the Berea salad greens facility and to maintain flexibility in the allocation of capital resources, we have temporarily paused development of the Morehead salad greens facility, with construction now expected to resume in 2022 and be operational in 2023.
We expect to have four CEA facilities operational by the end of 2022, with approximately 165 acres under production. We expect to develop additional CEA facilities only after obtaining the necessary capital, assuming, among other things, that we are able to obtain necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms.
To optimize our production capabilities, innovate on sustainability measures, and deliver on our goal of establishing AppHarvest as a leader within CEA, we are committed to developing and sourcing the most advanced technology available, especially in the fields of robotics, artificial intelligence, and automation. As part of these efforts, AppHarvest has empowered its subsidiary, AppHarvest Technology, Inc. (“AppHarvest Technology” or “ATI”), to design and sell new technology products to the broader agricultural market. While we believe we will be able to secure the financing needed for investments required for ATI to reach its full commercial potential, our ability to develop our AppHarvest Technology. depends on obtaining the necessary capital, assuming, among other things, that we are able to obtain necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms.
AppHarvest Technology also identifies and partners with other industry-leading agricultural technology companies to deliver a competitive advantage for AppHarvest’s operations. By building new products and enabling and enhancing partnerships between AppHarvest and leading agricultural tech companies, we leverage each other’s expertise and unlock new efficiencies and capabilities. Presently, these efforts are focused on two primary initiatives: A harvesting robot and a cloud-based enterprise software system to enhance visibility into labor management and quality control within CEA facilities.
Agriculture’s Current Challenges and Our Opportunity

Today’s agriculture challenges are wide-reaching and accelerating. The World Bank forecasts that global food production will need to increase by approximately 50% or more by 2050 to feed the growing global population. Inclusive of vine crops, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) predicts that the total annual value of domestic fruit, vegetable, and nut production will exceed $66 billion by 2029, a $14 billion annual increase over the 2020 annual value. In 2020, vegetable production accounted for approximately 41% of total farm value (or approximately $21.5 billion), with fresh use vegetables comprising approximately 32% of the market (or approximately $6.9 billion). Tomatoes are the second most popular fresh market produce in the United States. Per capita consumption of fresh tomatoes has grown to approximately 21 pounds per year, approximately 75% higher than it was nearly four decades ago. The USDA attributes this growth primarily to changing consumer preferences and a shift towards a healthier diet and overall lifestyle.
Domestically, the increasing demand for fresh fruits and vegetables has necessitated significant imports of produce into the United States. In 2020, the cumulative value of these imports grew by 13%. The majority of America’s supply of fresh tomatoes and other vine crops, including cucumbers, bell peppers, and eggplants, are imported. In 2019, 60% of fresh tomatoes for sale in the United States were imported, up from 41% in 2009. Imports of eggplant accounted for 56% of supply in 2019, up from 43% in 2009.
Meanwhile, 66% of bell peppers and 81% of cucumbers were imported in 2019, up from 46% and 56%, respectively, in 2009. Over approximately the last three decades, the United States’ reliance on imports has more than doubled. The country’s single largest import partner is Mexico, which comprises 75% of U.S. fresh vegetable imports.
Percentage of Crops Imported:
A continued reliance on imports puts the U.S. food supply at risk from both natural and politically destabilizing events. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted this risk. During the pandemic, the supply chain has been disrupted and food imports have been, at times, delayed or even cancelled.
A reduced or delayed supply of produce can have a pronounced impact on grocers, which generally operate on thin financial margins and just-in-time inventory practices. A consistent and reliable supply chain is vital to the grocery retail industry, which attempts to match closely the perishable supply of produce to near-term customer demand. We believe that CEA, which provides more reliable, sustainable, and higher quality produce, produced in accordance with much higher food safety standards, is an optimal solution for the grocery industry’s reliance on imports, and that there will be a strong preference among distributors and grocers to shift from imports to CEA as more supply becomes available from CEA.
Demand for sustainable farming and new CEA infrastructure has been amplified by the effects of climate change and other environmental factors. Historically, California and Mexico have produced a majority of the fresh produce sold to consumers in the United States. Unsustainable farming practices, structural changes in water resources, and an over-reliance on chemicals, which can be harmful to people in a variety of ways, have degraded large swaths of arable land. Globally, approximately one-third of arable land is estimated to be at least partially degraded. This could increase to more than 90% of arable land unless there is a significant shift in farming practices and infrastructure.
In addition, shifting weather patterns believed to be the result of climate change are accelerating the threat to existing agricultural regions. Reduced rainfall and increasingly hot conditions in certain growing regions are increasing the demand for, and consumption of, irrigation water. Two-thirds of Mexico is arid or semi-arid, with annual rainfalls of less than 500 millimeters. California’s Public Policy Institute estimates that 500,000 to 780,000 acres would need to lie fallow for the state’s natural aquifers to re-balance.
AppHarvest’s facilities are well positioned take advantage of Kentucky’s relatively high precipitation levels by capturing and recycling rainfall in large on-site retention ponds at our Morehead CEA facility and other planned CEAs, to meet our ongoing irrigation needs.
We believe that CEA is the global solution to address the rising demand for fresh fruits and vegetables, to offset the declining availability of high-quality farmland, and to mitigate the effect of climate change on agriculture. By using leading-edge technology, we expect, at full production capacity, to be able to grow up to 30 times more produce on a single indoor acre compared to a single, traditionally farmed outdoor acre.
This belief is based on third-party research and publications stating that produce grown in CEA facilities can yield anywhere from 20 to 50 times as much as traditional farming on the same amount of land. CEA allows for systematic measurements and tailoring of important variables on a per-crop level, such as nutrient levels, temperature, humidity, and irrigation. CEA generally benefits from potential year-round optimal farming conditions, whereas open field farming and traditional greenhouses have more limited growing seasons.
We also believe that AppHarvest is positioned to become a global leader in the CEA industry. We are one of only a few publicly traded companies focused on CEA-enabled food production in the United States. Our CEA facilities in Appalachia are designed to maximize the sustainability and efficiency of our operations. For example, our ability to farm using captured rainwater not only decreases our impact on the environment, but eliminates the high cost of water. Captured rainwater also allows us to avoid harmful agricultural runoff, a major source of U.S. waterways pollution. Our geographic proximity to the markets we serve reduces the fuel needed to transport our fruits and vegetables to customers, thereby reducing the 
environmental impact of distributing our products. Relative to growers in California and Mexico, we estimate we can distribute our products using up to 80% less fuel and with an extended shelf life and less spoilage due to a shorter time spent in transit.
Our Solution
The key components to our strategy include:
•Sustainable CEA facilities: By insulating our food production system from seasonal and weather constraints, our CEA facilities are expected to produce up to 30 times more fruits and vegetables compared to traditional open-field agriculture, while also using up to 90% less water.
•Strategic location near major population centers: Given our location within one day’s drive of nearly 70% of the U.S. population, we are positioned to use significantly less fuel to transport our products, compared to fruits and vegetables shipped from the southwestern United States, especially California, and Mexico.
•AgTech ecosystem: AppHarvest led the signing of a non-binding collaboration agreement by a 17-organization coalition of universities, governments, and leading AgTech companies in the U.S. and abroad, which increased to a 26-organization coalition in February 2022. The collaboration agreement is intended to identify opportunities to leverage each other’s expertise and find opportunities to work together to support large-scale development in Central Appalachia. AppHarvest believes this coalition will partially reduce our research & development costs and enable us to source and identify new advancements, technologies, and opportunities more quickly than we necessarily would on our own.
•Technology: Sourcing, developing, and implementing applied technology will be a key differentiator for AppHarvest over the long term. We are working with leading technology companies in the agriculture industry, such as Dalsem and Havecon for greenhouse construction and development; Signify and GE for energy efficient LED lighting; Kopperts for advanced, integrated pest management; Priva B.V. for greenhouse software; TAKS Handling Systems and AWETA for pack line operations and data capture; and Arugga for automated robotic pollination. Additionally, AppHarvest Technology. is continuing its work on Virgo, an automated harvesting robot, and FarmOps, a new software product for greenhouse management. We will continue to invest and innovate in technology as we strive to be at the forefront of sustainable food production.
•Strong and available local labor force: AppHarvest is committed to paying a living wage which, on average, is approximately 40% higher than the average wage for comparable work in Kentucky. As a result, we believe we can recruit and retain a competitive workforce.
Morehead CEA Facility
The Morehead CEA facility, which partially opened in October 2020, and is now fully operational, is among the world’s largest greenhouses at 60 acres (approximately 2.8 million square feet). Its suite of cutting-edge technology includes:
•Hybrid lighting system: Our lighting system features a combination of natural sunlight, Signify GreenPower LEDs, and high-pressure sodium lighting.
•Water independence: Our recycled rainwater irrigation system used a 10-acre, on-site retention pond, thus eliminating the need for city or well water. This system enables us to use up to 90% less water compared to open field agriculture.
•Advanced closed-loop water filtration system: Our closed-loop water filtration system incorporates nano-bubble technology to combat harmful algae blooms and cyanotoxins, as well as sand filters and high-density ultraviolet lighting. (Ultraviolet lighting is designed to kill bacteria).
•Climate and greenhouse operations software: Designed by Priva B.V., our climate and greenhouse operations software allows our growers to monitor carefully microclimates inside our CEA facility and to calculate the precise levels of light, water, and carbon dioxide each plant needs to thrive. This operations software also allows for exact dosing of nutrients as well as temperature and humidity control on a plant-by-plant level.
•Innovative pest control strategy, or integrated pest management: “IPM” is an environmentally sensitive approach to pest management, which relies in part on the use of beneficial insects to combat damaging pests. We use parasitic wasps to control one of the most detrimental greenhouse pests: the whitefly. Predatory mites work similarly against harmful spider mites and fungus gnats.
Development Pipeline
Shortly after the partial opening of the Morehead CEA facility in October 2020, AppHarvest purchased two additional properties, the Richmond tomato facility and the Berea salad greens facility, both of which we anticipate will be operational by the end of 2022. In the second quarter of 2021, AppHarvest began construction of the Somerset and Morehead salad greens facility. The Somerset facility is expected to be operational by the end of 2022. As we strive to maintain flexibility with respect to the allocation of our capital resources, we have paused the Morehead salad greens facility until additional financing sources are secured. We plan to continue developing and opening additional facilities throughout Central Appalachia only after obtaining the necessary capital, assuming, among other things, that we are able to obtain necessary capital when needed and on acceptable terms. 
We have built a direct-to-consumer e-commerce platform that we expect will power our direct-to-consumer and value-added products businesses. We successfully launched and sold out our first value-added product, salsa, in 2021, and we expect to leverage this platform as we continue to refine and grow our value-added products strategy in the future, depending on the availability of financing on acceptable terms. We have paused the sale and development of our salsa and other products in 2022. The three farms expected to be operational in 2022 should provide us a significantly larger volume of produce from which to derive value-added and direct-to-consumer products when expected sales and development resume. Accordingly, we plan to spend time and resources developing capacity for larger-scale production that we believe will enable us to secure financing and permit us to relaunch our value-added products at a larger scale in the future. 
Our Strengths
Industry Leading Position with an Early Mover Advantage
Our Morehead CEA facility, combined with our in-development greenhouses in Richmond, Berea, Morehead, and Somerset, position us among the largest CEA growers in the United States. Our current production acreage is growing beefsteak tomatoes, tomatoes on the vine, and Campari tomatoes. We plan to expand into salad greens and berries. AppHarvest is also employing a “go-to-market” strategy through our partnership with Mastronardi Produce Limited (“Mastronardi”), which should enable us to build customer awareness and brand loyalty for future fruits, vegetables, and other value-added products.
Skilled Integrator of Proven Technologies
Our development and technology teams are highly skilled in applied agricultural technology. In many instances, the right technology to maximize crop yields sustainably already exists in the marketplace. The Netherlands, for example, has long relied on high-tech CEA facilities for domestic fruit and vegetable production and is the world’s second-largest agricultural exporter despite a land mass roughly one-third the size of Kentucky. To this end, we are working directly with companies that have been successful in the Netherlands, as well as construction firms with experience building these types of structures.
Strategic Partnerships with Important Industry Participants
To aid us in accomplishing our objectives, we have pursued partnerships with select third parties to allow us to focus our capital and resources in areas that maximize value for our Company and shareholders.
Mastronardi
Mastronardi is our exclusive marketing and distribution partner for all fresh fruits and vegetables grown in Kentucky and West Virginia, including tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, berries, and/or all salad greens that meet certain quality standards. Mastronardi is the leading marketer and distributor in North America of tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, berries, and salad greens (collectively, the “Products”). Mastronardi has an extensive and long-established retail network and is nationally recognized under the primary SUNSET® brand and other brands, including Campari®, Angel Sweet®, Flavor Bombs®, Sugar Bombs® tomatoes and WOW™ berries. Through our partnership, we receive immediate access to a large and coveted customer base. Our produce is currently available for sale in the produce aisles of some grocers.
Pursuant to our Agreement with Mastronardi, Mastronardi is the sole and exclusive marketer and distributor of all Products of our Morehead CEA facility. Under the terms of this “Mastronardi Morehead Agreement”, AppHarvest is responsible for growing, producing, packing and delivering all Products to Mastronardi, and Mastronardi is responsible for marketing, branding, and distributing our Products to its customers.
Mastronardi has agreed to sell our Products at market prices consistent with the best and highest prices available throughout the applicable growing season for similar USDA Grade No. 1 products. Mastronardi will set the market price for the Products and will pay over to AppHarvest the gross sale price of the Products it sells, less a marketing fee and its costs incurred in the sale and distribution of the Products. If Mastronardi rejects, returns, or otherwise refuses Products for failure to meet certain quality standards, AppHarvest has the right, at its cost and expense, to sell or otherwise dispose of the Products, subject to certain conditions. AppHarvest has developed options for generating revenue from any such Products, including by selling them to secondary distribution outlets and using them to create value-added products.
If AppHarvest expands the growing acreage or operations of any of its existing facilities in Kentucky or West Virginia, Mastronardi has a right of first refusal to be the exclusive distributor of any produce arising as a result of such expansion for the greater of ten years from the date of first commercial production of the additional products or the remainder of the term of the Mastronardi Morehead Agreement. In the event AppHarvest or its affiliates operate a new facility in Kentucky or West Virginia, Mastronardi has the right to deem such “New Grower Facility” to be under an agreement with Mastronardi on the same material terms and conditions of the Mastronardi Morehead Agreement for a period of ten years. In December 2020, Mastronardi elected to deem AppHarvest’s new facilities in Richmond and Berea as New Grower Facilities.
The initial term of the Mastronardi Morehead Agreement is ten years, beginning on the date of the commercial harvest of AppHarvest’s first crop. After the initial term, the Mastronardi Morehead Agreement renews automatically for additional one-year terms unless terminated by either party by written notice not later than 240 calendar days prior to the end of the applicable term. Either AppHarvest or Mastronardi can terminate the Mastronardi Morehead Agreement if the other party is subject to certain bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or if the other party is in breach of the Mastronardi Morehead Agreement and the breach remains uncured for a specified period. AppHarvest’s obligation to deliver timely Products to Mastronardi and to maintain exclusivity is not subject to cure.
Mastronardi has the exclusive right to sell and market all fresh fruits and vegetables, including tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, berries and/or salad greens, grown by AppHarvest in Kentucky and West Virginia for an initial term of 10 years from each facility’s first commercial harvest. If Mastronardi declines to exercise its right of first refusal, AppHarvest has the right to contract with unaffiliated third parties that are industry recognized bona fide marketers for distribution of such produce. Sale transactions would be at market price, less the marketing fee and costs incurred in the sale and distribution of Products. Outside of Kentucky and West Virginia, AppHarvest has agreed not to compete with Mastronardi, including growing fresh produce in a new facility outside of Kentucky and West Virginia in an area in which it would be competing with Mastronardi, for a period of ten years that commences on the date of the first commercial harvest from the Morehead CEA Facility and also runs for ten years, measured from the latest date of a first commercial harvest from a facility deemed to be a New Grower Facility by Mastronardi under the terms of the Mastronardi Morehead Agreement. AppHarvest has also agreed not to solicit any employee of Mastronardi or its affiliates without Mastronardi’s written consent during the term of each applicable Mastronardi purchase and marketing agreement, and for a period thereafter.
Dalsem and Havecon
Dalsem is a highly regarded manufacturer and developer of end-to-end, high-tech greenhouse projects. The company has more than 85 years of experience and is perceived as a pioneer and an innovator within the industry. We selected Dalsem as our construction partner for our first CEA facility in Morehead, Kentucky, pursuant to an engineering, procurement and construction agreement. We have also entered into a direct contractual relationship with Dalsem for the construction of our new CEA facilities in Richmond and Berea, Kentucky.
Havecon is a designer and manufacturer of greenhouse horticulture projects. AppHarvest selected Havecon to build its facility in Somerset, Kentucky, because of its industry know-how, years of experience, strong reputation, network of industry partners, and expected ability to complete the project quickly and on time.
Our relationships with Dalsem and Havecon present potential long-term advantages, including reducing the risk associated with construction, such as the availability of certain inputs and materials for the facilities, and favorable construction timelines.
Rabo AgriFinance
In June 2021, AppHarvest secured a $75 million credit facility with Rabo AgriFinance, a leading financial services provider for agricultural producers and agribusinesses in the United States. Under the terms of the facility, we entered into a 60% loan-to-value mortgage at an anticipated fixed rate of between 4 to 5% for 10 years, with amortization of debt over 20 years for the Morehead CEA facility. Rabo AgriFinance is a subsidiary of Rabobank, a premier bank to the global agriculture industry and one of the world’s largest and strongest banks. 
Also in June 2021, we entered into an interest rate swap with an affiliate of Rabo AgriFinance to make a series of payments based on a fixed rate of 1.602% and receive a series of payments based on LIBOR. As of December 31, 2021, the net fixed interest rate on the combined Rabo Loan and related interest rate swap is 4.102%. See Note 10-Debt to our consolidated financial statements for more information of the Rabo AgriFinance credit facility. 
JP Morgan
In September 2021, AppHarvest entered a $25 million cash-backed credit facility with JP Morgan based on its third high-tech, 30-acre indoor farm under construction in Somerset, Kentucky, which broke ground in June 2021. This CEA facility is intended to grow berries. Proceeds from the 364-day credit facility, which is priced at LIBOR plus 225 basis points, will be applied toward capital expenditures and improvements, including construction of the company’s fourth high-tech indoor farm. 
In January 2022, we amended this credit facility to: (i) increase the existing line of credit facility in the maximum amount from $25 million to $50 million; and (ii) implement SOFR as the replacement of LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate for U.S. dollar borrowings.
Experienced and Passionate Team
AppHarvest is a mission-driven company led by highly committed and passionate professionals. Our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Jonathan Webb, is a Kentucky native with more than a decade of experience focused on sustainable infrastructure. Prior to founding AppHarvest in 2018, Mr. Webb led a public-private partnership on behalf of the Department of Defense, developing what was then the largest solar project in the southeastern United States. At AppHarvest, Mr. Webb has used his experience in renewable infrastructure to create a CEA platform in North America.
In January 2021, David Lee, an existing member of the board of directors of AppHarvest, joined the Company to serve as President. Prior to joining AppHarvest, Mr. Lee was the Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Impossible Foods, where he led strategy and operations as the company evolved from a startup into the scaled food company they are today. Prior to Impossible Foods, Mr. Lee held executive leadership positions at several companies, including Del Monte Foods, where he helped restructure the business concurrent with KKR’s acquisition of the company. Additionally, AppHarvest has a talented roster of senior executives, including Loren Eggleton, Chief Financial Officer; Derek Lyons, General Counsel; Julie Nelson, Chief Operating Officer; Josh Lessing, Chief Technology Officer; Jackie Roberts, Chief Sustainability Officer; and Dave Nichols, Head of Strategy.
AppHarvest has attracted a highly experienced “grow team” to operate our greenhouses. Our senior growers have, on average, more than 25 years of experience managing growing operations. We also have a construction management and development team with extensive experience in complex, large scale, multi- site, and global projects.
ESG Company
AppHarvest has an authentic and overarching commitment to sustainability, ESG, and social impact. Our Certified B Corporation certification recognizes our commitment to our stakeholders, including our employees, community, environment, customers, and stockholders. We believe we present a unique and a compelling opportunity for the growing number of investors who share our dedication to sustainability and a broader set of ESG principles.
We have also been certified by an independent non-profit organization as meeting rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency. We are proud of our achievements to date, including:
•Selecting Rowan County for our Morehead CEA facility, in which approximately 25% of the community lives below the poverty line. Despite reduced wage expectations in this area, we have provided career opportunities with entry-level wages that are over 40% higher than average hourly wages for comparable jobs in the state.
•We have invested over $100 million in the local Rowan County community, which we believe will have an economic ripple effect as those expenditures percolate through our contractors, engineers, and other tradespeople required to build our large-scale facilities.
•In addition to paying a living wage, as assessed by an independent third party, we provide paid time off and full family healthcare coverage.
•We have partnered with local universities and high schools. We plan to educate more than 1,000 high school students through our educational programs around hydroponic farming.
We believe we also have an opportunity to impact how the regional power grid evolves. As we grow and need more power, we are committed to catalyzing new renewable energy sources in our market. We believe that when corporations insist upon completely renewable energy, market forces will drive suppliers to provide electrical energy with a reduced carbon footprint. As a member of the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance (“REBA”), a community of energy buyers seeking to accelerate a zero-carbon energy future, we also benefit from REBA resources as we strive to operate on renewable energy.
We aim not only to transform the Appalachia region in terms of social and economic impact, but also to build a platform to transform agriculture and bring new solutions for growing threats to the agriculture sector, including water shortages, land shortages, soil depletion, surface water pollution, pesticide use, food waste, and systemic risks from climate change. Our growing process reduces environmental impacts and manages the environmental risks increasingly threatening our food systems. Specifically, our CEA facility is designed to manage these risks and reduces environmental impacts by:
•Using up to 90% less water than conventional agriculture in a closed system that prevents pollution from excess fertilizers and chemical pesticides running into local streams or waterways.
•Making efficient use of land without depleting soil and its nutrients.
•Using integrated pest management, skilled workers, and AI tools designed to keep the greenhouse free of or with minimal of pests and disease in accordance with our Chemical Pesticide Policy.
•Using a horizontal greenhouse structure to maximize passive solar energy.
•Implementing new lighting systems that use 20% less energy than traditional lighting systems through integration of LEDs.
•Working towards exciting opportunities to link operations to renewable energy initiatives.
Growth Strategy
Through investments in Central Appalachia, our brand, our stakeholders and our infrastructure, we believe that we are well-positioned to grow our brand and attract consumers through our distribution partner Mastronardi, which provides us with full distribution on day one of production, allowing customers to experience our products and us to grow customer recognition and loyalty.
New Project Pipeline
AppHarvest expects to develop additional CEA facilities only after obtaining the necessary capital, assuming, among other things, that we are able to obtain necessary capital when needed and on acceptable terms. We believe that allocating capital to organic growth, specifically the development of new facilities, presents a compelling return on invested capital.
Our Morehead CEA facility partially opened in October 2020, and has been fully operational since March 2021. Shortly thereafter, we announced groundbreakings for two additional facilities, the Richmond tomato facility and the Berea salad greens facility, both of which we anticipate will be operational by the end of 2022. In the second quarter of 2021, we announced the beginning of construction of the Somerset facility and the Morehead salad greens facility. The Somerset facility is expected to be operational by the end of 2022. We have temporarily paused development of the 10-acre Morehead salad greens facility, with construction now expected to resume in 2022 for a 2023 delivery.
Our site selection and construction management processes, as well as all major investment capital decisions, require sign off from our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with additional oversight from the Board of Directors. Cost, development timelines, expansion opportunities, proximity to our existing facilities, crop economics and overall site-level returns on invested capital are among the many factors we consider before greenlighting a project.
Strategy to Develop Branded and Sustainable Value-Added Products
AppHarvest is an applied technology company with global ambitions and a desire to become a trusted brand with broad brand awareness. We aim to leverage our ESG- and mission-driven ethos to grow and produce fruits, vegetables and value-added products that customers will actively seek out at their local grocery stores. While our focus is on fresh produce, we have also built a direct-to-consumer e-commerce platform that we expect to power our direct to consumer and value added products business, the future development of which is contingent upon our ability to secure additional financing on acceptable terms.
Competition
With vine crops imports rapidly increasing, our competition includes large-scale operations in Mexico and, to a lesser extent, the southwestern United States. With studies having found that an American meal travels 1,500 miles on average to the consumer’s plate, we believe we are unique in becoming a large-scale CEA operator growing produce closer to the end consumer.
Overall Competition
The U.S. greenhouse industry has grown steadily over the past decade as producers use its advantages to grow more using fewer resources, seeking to solve issues caused by limited land, energy and resources including water and labor. The USDA attributes growth to greenhouse operators’ ability to realize greater market access both in the off-season and in northern retail produce markets, better product consistency and improved yields.
By 2017, the percentage of greenhouse-grown U.S. shipments of fresh tomatoes had grown to 5% of all shipments. Only four states (California, Minnesota, Nebraska and New York) produce more than 10 million pounds of greenhouse-grown tomatoes annually, according to the most recent USDA data. Kentucky’s production was estimated by the USDA to be between 500,000 pounds to 1 million pounds annually. Our operations in Morehead, Kentucky are vaulting Kentucky into over 10 million annual pounds category.
Competition from Imports
In 2004, growers in the United States, Canada and Mexico each supplied around 300 million pounds of greenhouse-grown tomatoes to the United States. According to the USDA in 2019, since then, Mexico’s market share averaged 35 percent annual growth. Greenhouse-grown tomato imports from Mexico accounted for 84% of total greenhouse-grown tomato imports in the United States in 2017, while imports of greenhouse- grown tomatoes from Canada held steady at around 300 million pounds annually.
A challenge for high-tech producers in the United States is the possibility that lower-cost Mexican producers will be able to increasingly step up and meet emerging U.S. retail market preferences for higher quality, improved product safety, year-round availability, and product innovation. Mexican producers would most likely aim to achieve this not by investing equivalent capital, but by leveraging climatic and labor advantages.
Meanwhile, Canadian greenhouse operators, which are located primarily in Ontario in the east and British Columbia in the west and often supported by extensive government subsidies and financing, are increasingly initiating or expanding operations in the United States. The major factors driving this expansion are brand value of U.S. production and lower transportation and energy costs at U.S. facilities.
Beyond greenhouse-grown tomatoes imports are making up an increasing percentage of all fresh tomatoes. In 2000, imports accounted for only 30% of fresh tomatoes in the United States and increased to 60% in 2019. Imports accounted for a majority of fresh tomato supply starting in 2010 after a series of weather-related issues in Florida necessitated imports to replace expected open-field tomato production.
We believe that market leadership will accrue to the most efficient producers who are able to reliably meet the needs of large U.S. retailers and can demonstrate advantages in marketing strategy, geography, ESG, food safety, technology, and production learning curves sufficient to warrant the substantial long-term working capital required to fuel the expected sustained growth of this market segment.
Traditional Greenhouse Operators
Large-scale greenhouse operators currently dominate the market in the indoor agriculture space, as they have large-scale distribution networks and own and operate hundreds to thousands of acres of greenhouse. Most of the companies have major portions of their operations in Mexico and Canada, but we believe all or nearly all of them are either looking to develop, are developing or have already developed U.S.- based high-tech greenhouses. These companies have broad product lines and are moving into the prepared food space to leverage their scale and distribution networks.
High-Tech Agricultural Startups
While most CEA production comes from traditional greenhouse companies, a number of high-tech vertical farms also exist in the market. These startups are often focused on development of farms either in or near major cities. These companies generally have smaller product offerings and tend to focus on salad greens products due to limitations of their technologies and economics. By contrast, we believe our facilities will have the ability to grow a variety of crops including salad greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, strawberries, peppers, eggplants, and more. We are also differentiated in prioritizing use of two of the earth’s natural inputs: sunlight and water. In fact, our Morehead CEA facility is one of the only facilities of its type and size in North America to rely primarily on rainwater for its production. Although we do supplement the light our plants receive with LED lighting and high-pressure sodium lighting, our plants primarily grow using natural sunlight, requiring less energy per plant than indoor warehouse farms. There are several companies that sell farm management software for the CEA market. These software offerings have traditionally had limitations since they do not track many aspects of a farm’s operations and they are difficult to integrate with other enterprise information systems. Additionally, only a few of these software companies are either internally developing or collaborating with partners to offer robots that automate tasks ranging from crop forecasting to robotic harvesting. In these cases, the systems under development are limited in their design in that they are highly specialized for completing a single task on the farm. In contrast, our subsidiary, AppHarvest Technology, is developing software systems that can be applied to monitoring processes across a farm, are inter operable with complimentary information technologies, and will work in collaboration with a robotic farming platform that has been architected so that its core technology can be applied to accomplishing multiple tasks on the farm. With the acquisition of Root AI, Inc. (“Root AI”) in April 2021 (the “Root AI Acquisition”), we are an applied technology company, through our ATI subsidiary, which develops CEA technology solutions for internal use and potential sale to customers in the global CEA industry. 
Government Regulation
We are subject to laws and regulations administered by various federal, state and local government agencies in the United States, such as FDA, the FTC, the EPA, the OSHA, and the USDA. These laws and regulations apply to the processing, packaging, distribution, sale, marketing, labeling, quality, safety, and transportation of our products, as well as our occupational safety and health practices.
Under various federal statutes and implementing regulations, these agencies, among other things, prescribe the requirements and establish the standards for quality and safety and regulate our products and the manufacturing, labeling, marketing, promotion, and advertising thereof.
Among other things, the facilities in which our products are grown, packed or processed may be required to register with the FDA (depending on specific growing, packing, and processing operations), comply with regulatory schemes including Standards for the Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding of Produce for Human Consumption, Current Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food and FDA and USDA labeling and marketing requirements, as amended by the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 (“FSMA”), the Organic Food Production Act, among other laws and regulations implemented by the FDA, the USDA, and other regulators. FSMA regulations are still being developed and implemented, including product traceability requirements recently proposed, which would be directly applicable to our products. The FDA and the USDA have the authority to inspect these facilities depending on the type of product and operations involved. The FDA and the USDA also require that certain nutrition and product information appear on its product labels and more generally, that its labels and labeling be truthful and non-misleading. Similarly, the FTC requires that our marketing and advertising be truthful, non-misleading, not deceptive to consumers, and not otherwise an unfair means of competition. We are also restricted by FDA and USDA from making certain types of claims about our products, including nutrient content claims, health claims, organic claims, and claims regarding the effects of our products on any structure or function of the body, whether express or implied, unless we satisfy certain regulatory requirements.
We are also subject to parallel state and local food safety regulation, including registration and licensing requirements for our facilities, enforcement of standards for our products and facilities by state and local health agencies, and regulation of our trade practices in connection with selling our products.
We are also subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising, privacy laws, safety regulations and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that regulate retailers or govern the promotion and sale of merchandise. Our operations, and those of our distributors and suppliers, are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and worker health and safety matters.
Certified B Corporation
While not required by Delaware law or the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we have elected to have our social and environmental performance, accountability and transparency assessed against the proprietary criteria established by an independent non-profit organization. As a result of this assessment, in December 2019, we were designated as a Certified B Corporation.
In order to be designated as a Certified B Corporation, companies are required to take a comprehensive and objective assessment of their positive impact on society and the environment. The assessment evaluates how a company’s operations and business model impact its workers, customers, suppliers, community and the environment using a 200-point scale. While the assessment varies depending on a company’s size (number of employees), sector and location, representative indicators in the assessment include payment above a living wage, employee benefits, stakeholder engagement, supporting underserved suppliers and environmental benefits from a company’s products or services. After completing the assessment, the independent organization that certified us as a Certified B Corporation will verify our score to determine if we meet the 80- point minimum bar for certification. The review process includes a phone review, a random selection of indicators for verifying documentation and a random selection of company locations for onsite reviews, including employee interviews and facility tours. Once certified, every Certified B Corporation must make its assessment score transparent on the independent organization’s website.
Acceptance as a Certified B Corporation and continued certification is at the sole discretion of the independent organization that certified us as a Certified B Corporation. To maintain our certification, we are required to update our assessment and verify our updated score with the independent organization every three years. We will need to update our current certification no later than December 30, 2022. Additionally, we were required to commit to re-certifying within 90 days following the closing of the Business Combination and to complete this recertification within one year following the closing of the Business Combination and are currently in the process of recertification.
Public Benefit Corporation
In connection with our Certified B Corporation status and as a demonstration of our long-term commitment to our mission, we have been a public benefit corporation under Delaware law since inception.
Under Delaware law, a public benefit corporation is required to identify in its certificate of incorporation the public benefit or benefits it will promote and its directors have a duty to manage the affairs of the corporation in a manner that balances the pecuniary interests of the corporation’s stockholders, the best interests of those materially affected by the corporation’s conduct, and the specific public benefit or public benefits identified in the public benefit corporation’s certificate of incorporation. To date, there is limited case law involving public benefit corporations and the application of this and other distinct public benefit corporation requirements, which may create some uncertainty until additional case law develops.
Security holders should note, however, that Sections 361 and 365 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”) indicate that Delaware’s longstanding “business judgment rule” should apply to the balancing determinations required of public benefit corporation directors so long as directors remain informed and free of conflicts of interests. Similarly, a director’s ownership of or other interest in stock of the public benefit corporation will not, for purposes of Subsection XV, create conflict of interest on the part of the director with respect to the director’s decision implicating the balancing requirement in the public benefit corporation, except to the extent that such ownership or interest would create a conflict of interest if the corporation were not a public benefit corporation. We expect that, in large part, traditional Delaware corporation law principles and the application of those principles in case law — including those related to self-dealing, conflicts of interest, and the application of the business judgment rule — will continue to apply with respect to public benefit corporations.
As provided in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the public benefits that we promote, and pursuant to which we manage, are empowering individuals in Appalachia, driving positive environmental change in the agriculture 
industry, and improving the lives of our employees and the community at large. Public benefit corporations organized in Delaware are required to assess their benefit performance internally and to disclose to stockholders at least biennially a report detailing their success in meeting their benefit objectives. We will also consider the objectives and standards by which we will measure and report our public benefit performance in our public benefit corporation reports, including potential key performance metrics, and we have not made a final decision on such matters. We expect that we will conduct our own assessment of our benefit performance against the standards and metrics we develop, rather than having such performance conducted by a third party. We have completed a materiality assessment with an independent third party, designated our ESG metrics, and expect to report our first set of data in our Sustainability Report, which we expect to release in the first half of 2022.
Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property and proprietary rights are valuable assets and we rely on a combination of federal, state, common law and international rights in the jurisdictions to safeguard our intellectual property. Our trademarks and other proprietary rights are valuable assets that reinforce the distinctiveness of our brand to our consumers. We also have made, and have acquired, numerous patent applications. We believe our patents, trademarks, copyrights and domain names, and the protection of the underlying intellectual property, are important to our success. Accordingly, we own and have registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office trademarks and patent applications that are important to our business, including our principal trademark, AppHarvest, and have several additional trademark applications pending, as well.
Further, in addition to our U.S. intellectual property portfolio, we also seek intellectual property protection in certain other jurisdictions where available and where we deem appropriate, and have undertaken numerous foreign patent application filings. We also rely on unpatented proprietary expertise and copyright protection. We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on trademark and copyright, as well as the use of use of nondisclosure, confidentiality, and intellectual property assignment agreements.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 500 full-time employees and approximately 130 independent contractors, all of whom are located in the United States. At December 31, 2021, our full-time workforce consisted of 37% female employees, which represented approximately 28.6% of management. Approximately 8.8% of our employees identified as a racial minority and represented 14.3% of management. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have never experienced a labor-related work stoppage. During the first quarter of 2022, we initiated a restructuring plan to reduce operating costs and improve profitability, which resulted in a decrease of our full-time employees by approximately 50. 
Upholding diversity, equity and inclusion is not only the right moral and ethical policy, it also makes good business sense. We have made a particular commitment to second-chance/fair-chance employment. We work with community partners who help prepare those potential candidates for employment with us. To ensure a fair shot, our interviewers are never aware interviewees are from second-chance or fair-chance programs. From top to bottom, we aim to hire a team of people as diverse as our nation and then empower them as individuals.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate personnel through the granting of equity-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of the company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives. 
We encourage employees to engage with our mission in many ways. One avenue is through “Mission Day” paid leave hours. These hours are intended to be used towards activities related to the Company’s mission, including but not limited to community volunteering and involvement. Examples include volunteering at a food bank or an animal shelter, participating in community beautification projects, or tutoring kids. Each year, employees receive up to 16 hours of paid leave designated as Mission Days depending upon their date of hire.
