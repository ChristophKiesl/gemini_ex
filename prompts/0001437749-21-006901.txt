Item 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

INTRODUCTION

inTEST Corporation was incorporated in New Jersey in 1981 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1997. The consolidated entity is comprised of inTEST Corporation (parent) and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. In this report, "we," "us," "our," and the "Company" refer to inTEST Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 
We are a global supplier of innovative test and process solutions for use in manufacturing and testing across a wide range of markets including automotive, defense/aerospace, industrial, medical, semiconductor and telecommunications. We manage our business as two operating segments, Thermal Products ("Thermal”) and Electromechanical Semiconductor Products ("EMS"), which are also our reporting units. Our Thermal segment designs, manufactures and sells our thermal test and thermal process products while our EMS segment designs, manufactures and sells our semiconductor test products.
 
Our EMS segment sells its products to semiconductor manufacturers and third-party test and assembly houses (end user sales) and to ATE manufacturers (OEM sales), who ultimately resell our equipment with theirs to both semiconductor manufacturers and third-party test and assembly houses. Our Thermal segment sells its products to many of these same types of customers; however, it also sells into a variety of other markets, including the automotive, defense/aerospace, industrial, medical and telecommunications markets.
 
We sell our products worldwide. Within the ATE market, we sell our products both directly to major semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor test subcontractors and indirectly through leading ATE manufacturers. In markets outside the ATE market, we sell our products directly to the end user of the product or through third party distributors. Our largest customers include Aixtron SE, Analog Devices, Inc., Emerson Electric Co., Hakuto Co. Ltd., Lockheed Martin Corporation, NXP Semiconductors N.V., QUALCOMM Incorporated, Raytheon Company, Renesas Electronics Corporation and Texas Instruments Incorporated.

COVID-19 PANDEMIC
 
Our net revenues from all of the markets we serve were significantly affected by COVID-19 during the first half of 2020. The impact of COVID-19 on our net revenues from the Semi Market was intensified during the first half of the year because our business operations were also being negatively affected by a global downturn in the Semi Market at that time. The Semi Market, from which approximately half of our net revenues are derived, entered a cyclical downturn in the beginning of 2019. During the first quarter of 2020, before the spread of COVID-19, we had started to see indications that the downturn was coming to an end. These indications included increased quoting activity and order levels for the first quarter of 2020 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. However, we believe COVID-19 delayed the recovery in the Semi Market as the increase in activity leveled off during late March 2020.
 
Although we saw slightly increased order rates from our customers in the Semi Market during the second and third quarters of 2020, it was not until the fourth quarter of 2020 that we saw a significant increase in our orders from the Semi Market which we believe indicates that we have now entered the next cyclical upturn. During the fourth quarter of 2020, our orders from the Semi Market increased 53% sequentially and were 141% higher than in the fourth quarter of 2019, the low point of the prior cyclical downturn for the products that we sell. We believe the level of increase in our orders from the Semi Market during the fourth quarter of 2020 reflects a combination of increased demand in the market resulting from the interruption of the normal recovery in the Semi Market cycle caused by the onset of COVID-19 in the first half of 2020, as well as increased demand for semiconductors, generally. We believe this increase in demand is being driven both by changing technology as well as increased use of technology across all aspects of daily life, such as in devices that facilitate remote work and education, smart technology used in homes and businesses, the increase in the amount of integrated circuits (“ICs”) used in the automotive industry and changes occurring in the telecommunications and mobility markets.
 
As of the date of this filing, all of our operations continue to be deemed “critical and essential business operations” under the various governmental COVID-19 mandates, which has allowed us to continue to operate our business with certain modifications. These modifications include a significant number of our employees working remotely. Such employees have been provided with the tools and technology necessary to do so. Additionally, we have implemented workplace safeguards designed to protect the health and well-being of our employees. Employees who remain in our facilities are following World Health Organization (“WHO”) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) recommended safety practices, as well as state and local directives. We have had occasions where one or more employees have contracted COVID-19 and entered our facilities while infected. To date, we have managed these occurrences with minimal disruption to our business while protecting other employees, but there can be no assurances that we can avoid similar occurrences in the future or, that in such cases, we can avoid significant disruption of our operations.
 
The aftermarket service and support that we provide to our customers has been, and we expect may continue to be, adversely impacted by COVID-19. Specifically, the travel restrictions that remain in place, coupled with limitations on visitors into customer facilities, have resulted in the reduction or suspension of certain activities. The net revenues associated with these aftermarket service and support activities typically range from 8% to 10% of our consolidated net revenues. Although these net revenues returned to a more typical range during the third and fourth quarters of 2020, if the spread of COVID-19 or variations of the virus worsen, these revenues may be reduced in future periods.

While the negative impact of COVID-19 on our business was reduced significantly in the second half of 2020, the spread of the virus or variants of the virus could worsen and one or more of our significant customers or suppliers could be impacted, or significant additional governmental regulations and restrictions could be imposed, thus negatively impacting our business in the future. See “Risks Related to COVID-19” under Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Report.
 
As a result of our current level of working capital as well as the availability of our revolving credit facility, which is discussed in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, we currently expect to have sufficient liquidity to operate our business throughout 2021, as further described in this Report. Although our revolving credit facility will mature on April 9, 2021, we are currently in discussions with our lender to replace this facility with a three-year credit facility. We expect that facility to be put in place in conjunction with, or prior to, the expiration of our current credit facility.
 
MARKETS
Overview
 Historically, we referred to our markets as “Semiconductor” (which included both the broader semiconductor market as well as the more specialized semiconductor ATE and wafer processing sectors within the broader semiconductor market), and “Non-Semiconductor” (which included all of the other markets we serve). In the second quarter of 2019, we began referring to the semiconductor market, including the ATE and wafer processing sectors within that market, as the “Semi Market.” All other markets, when referred to collectively, are designated as “Multimarket.” Business within our Thermal segment can fall into either the Semi Market or Multimarket, depending upon how our customers utilize our products or upon their respective applications, while business within our EMS segment is all within the Semi Market.
 
While the Semi Market represents the historical roots of inTEST and remains a very important component of our business, Multimarket is where we have focused our strategic growth efforts over the last several years. Our goal has been to grow our business, both organically and through acquisition, in Multimarket as we believe these markets have historically been less cyclical than the Semi Market. Moving forward, with the launch of our new strategic plan which is discussed below under “Our Strategies”, we are broadening our strategic growth efforts to target both organic and inorganic growth in all of our currently served markets, which includes the Semi Market. Our goal is to further expand our existing product lines, strengthen our positions in served markets and drive expansion into new markets.
 
Prior to the acquisition of Ambrell Corporation (“Ambrell”) in May 2017, we offered only highly specialized engineering solutions used for testing applications in Multimarket, the demand for which is limited and which varies significantly from period to period. Our acquisition of Ambrell not only provided expansion into new markets but also broadened our product offerings to include products sold into process or manufacturing applications. Historically, Ambrell sold its precision induction heating systems almost exclusively to customers in the industrial market but since 2018, has also had significant sales into the Semi Market. Overall, however, the acquisition of Ambrell has helped to diversify our customer base. We expect that our future orders and net revenues will be approximately equally split between the Semi Market and Multimarket. During 2020 and 2019, our net revenues from Multimarket were $27.0 million and $29.7 million, respectively, and represented 50% and 49%, respectively, of our total net revenues. In the five years prior to the acquisition of Ambrell, our net revenues from Multimarket ranged from 18% to 30% of our total net revenues.

 The level of our net revenues in Multimarket varies significantly from market to market. During 2020 and 2019, our net revenues from the industrial market represented 32% and 35%, respectively, of our total net revenues, while our net revenues from the defense/aerospace market represented 12% and 8%, respectively, of our total net revenues. Our net revenues from the telecommunications market represented 3% of our total net revenues in both years. The level of our net revenues in these markets has varied significantly in the past and we expect it will vary significantly in the future as we build our presence in these markets and establish new markets for our products. One of our goals is to further expand our Multimarket sales; however, due to the highly specialized nature of many of our product offerings, we do not expect broad market penetration in many of these markets. We are continuing to evaluate buying patterns and opportunities for growth in these markets that may affect our future performance.
 
Outside of the Semi Market, we have developed a meaningful market share in one other market, which is the induction heating market for systems with 500kW or less of power. This market is a subset of the industrial market. In contrast to the Semi Market, where we serve a range of customers and where our business trends generally follow overall market trends within the Semi Market, in the industrial market, where induction heating products are used, we serve a limited number of market participants representing only a portion of this market. Therefore, market trends in this area do not have as material an impact on our financial results. The following discussion of our markets is, therefore, limited to the Semi Market.

Semi Market
 As noted above, the Semi Market includes both the broader semiconductor market as well as the more specialized semiconductor ATE and wafer processing sectors within the broader semiconductor market. Historically, the Semi Market has been characterized by rapid technological change, wide fluctuations in demand and shortening product life cycles. Designers and manufacturers of a variety of electronic and industrial products, such as cell phones, telecom and datacom systems, Internet access devices, computers, transportation and consumer electronics, require increasingly complex ICs to provide improved end-product performance demanded by their customers. Semiconductor manufacturers generally compete based on product performance and price. We believe that testing costs represent a significant portion of the total cost of manufacturing ICs. Semiconductor manufacturers remain under pressure to maximize production yields and reduce testing costs. At the same time, the growing complexity of ICs has increased the difficulty of maximizing test yields. In order to address these market trends, semiconductor manufacturers strive for more effective utilization of ATE, smaller test areas and increased wafer level testing.

 Demand for new ATE and related equipment depends upon several factors, including the test equipment utilization rates of semiconductor manufacturers, the demand for products that incorporate ICs, the increasing complexity of ICs and the emergence of new IC design, production and packaging technologies. Some of the evolutionary changes in IC technologies include the shift to 300 mm wafers in production, system-on-a-chip (“SOC”) where digital, analog and memory functions are combined on a single IC, and chip scale packaging. As a result of these factors and other advances, semiconductor manufacturers may require additional ATE not only to handle increases in production, but also to handle the more sophisticated testing requirements of ICs.

IC Test Process
 Semiconductor manufacturers typically produce ICs in multiples of several hundred or more on a silicon wafer that is later separated or "diced" into individual ICs. Extended leads are then attached to the individual ICs for later connection to other electrical components. In most cases, the ICs are then encapsulated in a plastic, ceramic or other protective housing. These process steps are called "packaging."

 Wafers are tested before being diced and packaged to ensure that only properly functioning ICs are packaged. This testing step has several names, including "front-end test," "wafer test," "wafer probe" or "wafer sort." In front-end test, an electronic handling device known as a wafer prober automatically positions the wafer under a probe card that is electronically connected to a "test head," which connects electrically to a test system. During front-end testing, there is a growing trend of thermally conditioning the wafer during test. Once the good ICs have been identified, they are packaged.

 The packaged ICs also require testing, called "back-end test" or "final test," to determine if they meet design and performance specifications. Packaged ICs are tested after loading into another type of electronic handling device called a "package handler" or "handler," which then transfers the packaged ICs into a test socket that is attached to the test head. These handlers may be temperature controlled for testing.

 Testers range in price from approximately $100,000 to over $2.0 million each, depending primarily on the complexity of the IC to be tested. Probers and handlers range in price from approximately $50,000 to $500,000 each. A typical test floor of a large semiconductor manufacturer may have 100 test heads and 100 probers or 250 handlers supplied by various vendors for use at any one time. While larger global semiconductor manufacturers typically purchase ATE to test the ICs they manufacture, there are a growing number of semiconductor manufacturers who outsource IC testing to third-party foundries, test and assembly providers.
 
Test head manipulators, also referred to as positioners, facilitate the movement of the test head to the electronic device handler. Docking hardware mechanically connects the test head to the wafer prober or handler. Tester interface products provide the electrical connection between the test head and the wafer or packaged IC. Traditionally, temperature management products are used in back-end test to allow a manufacturer to test packaged ICs under the extreme temperature conditions in which the IC may be required to operate. However, we believe that temperature-controlled testing will be an increasingly important part of front-end wafer testing as more parameters traditionally tested in back-end test are moved to front-end test.
 
Trends in IC Testing
 
ATE is used to identify unacceptable packaged ICs and bad die on wafers. ATE assists IC manufacturers in controlling test costs by performing IC testing in an efficient and cost-effective manner. In order to provide testing equipment that can help IC manufacturers meet these goals, we believe the ATE market must address the following issues:
 
   -6-

  

Change in Technology. End-user applications are demanding ICs with increasingly higher performance, greater speeds, and smaller sizes. ICs that meet these higher standards, including SOC designs, are more complex and dense. These technology trends have significant implications for the IC testing process, including:

● | the need for test heads of higher complexity; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------
● | higher signal densities; 
● | increasing test speeds; and 
● | a new generation of testers for SOC and other technologies.

 
Need for Plug-Compatibility and Integration. Semiconductor manufacturers need test methodologies that will perform increasingly complex tests while lowering the overall cost of testing. This can require combining ATE manufactured by various companies into optimally performing systems. Semiconductor manufacturers have to work closely with various test hardware, software, interface and component vendors to resolve design and compatibility issues in order to make these vendors' products plug-compatible with test equipment manufactured by other vendors.

Testing Under Extreme Conditions. ICs will have to perform across a wider spectrum of temperature and environmental conditions than ever before because of the growing complexity of products in which they are deployed. In recent years, temperature testing has found an increasing role in front-end, wafer-level testing. Creating a uniform thermal profile over much larger wafer areas represents a significant engineering and design challenge for ATE manufacturers.
Demand for Higher Levels of Technical Support. As IC testing becomes more complex, semiconductor manufacturers demand higher levels of technical support on a routine basis. ATE manufacturers must commit appropriate resources to technical support in order to develop close working relationships with their customers. This level of support also requires close proximity of service and support personnel to customers' facilities.
Cost Reduction Through Increased Front-End Testing. As the cost of testing ICs increases, semiconductor manufacturers will continue to look for ways to streamline the testing process to make it more cost-effective, such as the trend to use massive parallel testing, in which semiconductor manufacturers test multiple ICs on the wafer simultaneously. We believe that this factor will lead to more front-end, wafer-level testing.
OUR SOLUTIONS
 We focus our development efforts on designing and producing high quality products that provide superior performance and cost-effectiveness. We seek to address each manufacturer's individual needs through innovative and customized designs, use of the best materials available, quality manufacturing practices and personalized service. We design solutions to overcome the evolving challenges facing the Semi Market and other markets that we serve, which we believe provide the following advantages:
 
Temperature-Controlled Testing. Our Thermostream(R) products are used by manufacturers in a number of markets to stress test a variety of semiconductor and electronic components, printed circuit boards and sub-assemblies. Factors motivating manufacturers to use temperature testing include design characterization, failure analysis and quality control, as well as determining performance under extreme operating temperatures, all of which contribute to manufacturing cost savings. Our thermal platforms and temperature chambers, sold under our Sigma Systems product line, can accommodate large thermal masses and are found in both laboratory and production environments. Thermonics' products provide a range of precision temperature forcing systems and have been melded into Temptronic's ATS ThermoStream product line. The Thermonics brand is now used to market a family of process chillers for test and industrial applications.

Induction Heating. Our acquisition of Ambrell added induction heating capabilities to our product offerings, which can be used by customers in process applications where precision controlled heating is needed.  Customers use our induction heating products in conjunction with other technologies in various manufacturing environments to improve production efficiencies.  Applications for our EKOHEAT(R) or EASYHEAT™ induction heating products include annealing, bonding, brazing, curing, forging, heat treating, melting, shrink-fitting and testing.
 
Scalable, Universal, High Performance Interface Technology. Our universal test head manipulators provide a high degree of positioning flexibility with a minimum amount of effort. As a result, our products can be used in virtually any test setting. Our manipulator products are designed to accommodate the increased size of test heads. Our docking hardware products offer precise control over the connection to test sockets, probing assemblies and interface boards, reducing downtime and minimizing costly damage to fragile components. Our newest manipulator and docking hardware designs offer automated capabilities that allow for reduced downtime and increased productivity through predictable and repeatable production setup with reduced risk of operator error. Our tester interface products optimize the integrity of the signals transmitted between the test head and the device under test by being virtually transparent to the test signals. This results in increased accuracy of the test data and may thus enable improved test yields. We believe that these characteristics will gain even more significance as testing becomes even more demanding.

Compatibility and Integration. A hallmark of our products has been, and continues to be, compatibility with a wide variety of ATE. Our manipulator and docking hardware products are all designed to be used with otherwise incompatible ATE. We believe this integrated approach to ATE facilitates smooth changeover from one tester to another, longer lives for interface components, better test results, increased ATE utilization and lower overall test costs.
Worldwide Customer Service and Support. We have long recognized the need to maintain a physical presence near our customers' facilities. As of December 31, 2020, we had domestic manufacturing facilities in Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York and provided service to our customers from sales and service personnel based in the U.S., Europe and Asia. Our engineers are easily accessible to, and can work directly with, most of our customers from the time we begin developing our initial proposal, through the delivery, installation and use of the product by our customer. In this way, we are able to develop and maintain close relationships with our customers.
OUR STRATEGIES
 In connection with the changes in our executive management team during the third quarter of 2020, which are discussed further in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements, we have recently announced changes in our corporate vision and strategy. Our corporate vision is to become the supplier of choice for innovative test and process technology solutions. We are committed to becoming recognized as a leader in our markets for design and manufacturing capabilities that result in high quality and cost-effective test and process solutions combined with a customer focus that drives a high level of customer satisfaction. We intend to achieve this vision through developing unique and differentiated solutions for the customers and industries we serve while at the same time expanding our portfolio of products, services, and support to drive increased value to our customers, thereby driving increased revenue for us. Our core strategies that we believe will allow us to achieve this vision and provide sustainable long-term growth are as follows:
Global and Market Expansion. We believe we can provide significant and sustainable long-term growth through a larger installed product base. In order to achieve this objective, we intend to make investments to drive further penetration in our existing markets. This may include initiatives to increase revenue both by selling a broader array of our current portfolio of products to our existing customer base as well as by expanding our customer base within these markets. In addition, we intend to increase our global footprint and coverage to better serve new and existing customers. Finally, our strategy in this area includes targeting expansion into new markets with our existing product portfolio.
Innovation and Differentiation. We plan to continue leveraging our know-how and expertise to deliver innovative solutions which we believe our competitors cannot match. We intend to allocate increased engineering resources towards developing new and unique solutions that are broadly applicable through standardized platforms that offer late-stage configuration. We believe this focus on driving more standardization to increase market availability and lower costs can positively impact our operational results as well as increase the breadth and depth of our customer base, both of which we expect will drive long-term sustainable growth in our revenue.
Service and Support. We believe service and support activities are valuable in strengthening customer satisfaction, loyalty and retention. Through ensuring that we serve our customers’ needs, whether by expanding service coverage and decreasing response time or through expanded and enhanced service offerings, we believe we can drive revenue growth and solidify our customer relationships. We plan to achieve these objectives by adding more resources to fill areas where we have identified gaps in service and support, as well as through adding remote service capabilities which can monitor the health of our products that are onsite at customer locations. In addition, we intend to focus on expanding our product portfolio to include more consumable products. We believe that increasing the number of ways and the frequency with which we make customer contacts can drive growth in our business in the future.
Strategic Acquisitions & Partnerships. Another element of our growth strategy has been, and will continue to be, to acquire businesses, technologies or products that are complementary to our current product offerings. We have acquired several businesses that have enabled us to expand our line of product offerings and have given us the opportunity to market a broader range of products to our customer base. We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions that help build our portfolio of technologies to better serve customers. These could be acquisitions which add to an existing business by expanding its product line or geographic presence, or new businesses that would allow us to expand our customer base and our served markets. We intend to explore opportunities across both of our product segments with the goal of expanding our electronic test capabilities, widening our thermal test capabilities in areas such as environmental test, and building out around the processing technologies that Ambrell added to our product offerings.
Talent and Culture. We believe ensuring the right people are in the right roles and are empowered to deliver success is crucial to the achievement of our core strategies. In addition, we intend to create a culture and environment of openness, one that is results-oriented and drives accountability across the organization. Finally, we intend to foster diversity and inclusion and provide opportunities for career development so as to maximize employee engagement, all of which is necessary to achieving our corporate vision.

OUR SEGMENTS
 As noted above, we have two operating segments, Thermal and EMS, which are also our reporting units. Our Thermal segment consists of (i) inTEST Thermal Solutions (“iTS”), which manufactures and sells products under the Temptronic, Sigma and Thermonics brand names, and (ii) Ambrell. iTS has operations in Massachusetts, Germany and Singapore. Ambrell has operations in New York, the Netherlands and the U.K. Customers use the thermal solutions produced by iTS for product development, characterization and production test or process applications. Ambrell provides customers with induction heating system solutions for conditioning, joining, and forming conductive materials in the manufacturing process. Our Thermal segment provides these solutions across an array of markets including automotive, defense/aerospace, industrial, medical, semiconductor and telecommunications.

 Our EMS segment consists of our manufacturing operations in New Jersey and, prior to December 31, 2020, our manufacturing operations in California. As discussed further in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements, during the fourth quarter of 2020, we transitioned the manufacturing operations that had been performed in California to our operation in New Jersey. Semiconductor manufacturers use our EMS solutions in back-end testing where our mechanical and electrical products serve production testing of wafers and specialized packaged ICs. These ICs include microprocessors, digital signal processing chips, mixed signal devices, MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems), application specific ICs and specialized memory ICs, and are used primarily in the automotive, defense/aerospace, industrial, medical and telecommunications markets. We custom design most of our products for each customer's particular combination of ATE.
 
Thermal Products
ThermoStream(R) Products: Our ThermoStream(R) products are used in the Semi Market as a stand-alone temperature management tool, or in a variety of electronic test applications as part of our MobileTemp systems. ThermoStream(R) products provide a source of heated and cooled air that can be directed over the component or device under test. These systems are capable of controlling temperatures to within +/- 0.1 degree Celsius over a range of -100 degrees Celsius to as high as +300 degrees Celsius within 1.0 degree Celsius of accuracy. As a stand-alone tool, ThermoStreams(R) provide a temperature-controlled air stream to rapidly change and stabilize the temperature of packaged ICs and other devices.

 Our MobileTemp Series combines our ThermoStream(R) products with our family of exclusive, high-speed ThermoChambers to offer thermal test systems with fast, uniform temperature control in a compact package enabling temperature testing at the test location. MobileTemp Systems are designed specifically for small thermal-mass applications beyond the Semi Market and have found application in the automotive, electronic, fiber optic and oil field service markets testing such things as electronic sub-assemblies, sensor assemblies, and printed circuit boards.

 Traditionally, our customers use ThermoStream(R) products primarily in engineering, quality assurance and small-run manufacturing environments. ThermoStream(R) and MobileTemp products range in price from approximately $15,000 to $50,000.

Thermal Chambers: Our chamber products are available in a variety of sizes, from small bench-top units to chambers with internal volumes of twenty-seven cubic feet and greater and with temperature ranges as wide as from -190 degrees Celsius to +500 degrees Celsius. Chambers can be designed to utilize liquid nitrogen or liquid carbon dioxide cooling or mechanical refrigeration, and sometimes both. These chambers can accommodate large thermal masses and are found in both laboratory and production environments. Chambers are priced from $15,000 to $150,000.
Thermal Platforms: Our platforms are available in surface sizes ranging from 7.2 square inches to 616 square inches. They provide a flat, thermally conductive, precisely temperature controllable surface that is ideal for conditioning of testing devices with a flat surface. Platforms are available with temperature ranges as broad as -100 degrees Celsius to +250 degrees Celsius. Thermal platforms can be designed to utilize either liquid nitrogen or liquid carbon dioxide cooling or mechanical refrigeration. Platforms offer virtually unimpeded access to the device under test and their easy access and compact size makes them ideal for convenient bench-top use. Platforms are priced from $6,500 to $65,000.

Thermonics(R) Products: Our Thermonics temperature conditioning products, which include our process chillers, provide tempered gas or fluid to enable customers to maintain desired thermal conditions within their tool or process. Applications include general industrial, chemical processing, energy, electronics, automotive, defense/aerospace and semiconductor markets. Prices range from $20,000 to greater than $250,000.

EKOHEAT(R) Products: Our EKOHEAT(R) induction heating systems with power ratings from 10kW to 500kW are manufactured by Ambrell and are used to conduct fast, efficient, repeatable non-contact heating of metals or other electrically conductive materials in order to transform raw materials into finished parts. Prices range from $25,000 to $250,000.
 
EASYHEAT™ Products: Our compact EASYHEAT™ induction heating systems with power ratings from 1kW to 10kW are manufactured by Ambrell are used to conduct fast, efficient, repeatable non-contact heating of metals or other electrically conductive materials in order to transform raw materials into finished parts. Prices range from $5,000 to $25,000.

Applications for both EKOHEAT(R) and EASYHEAT™ products include annealing, bonding, brazing, curing, forging, heat treating, melting, shrink-fitting, soldering and testing.
 
EMS Products
Manipulator Products. We offer three lines of manipulator products: the in2(R), the Cobal and the LS Series. These free-standing universal manipulators can hold a variety of test heads and enable an operator to reposition a test head for alternate use with any one of several probers or handlers on a test floor.

 Our manipulator products incorporate a balanced floating-head design. This design permits a test head weighing up to 1,760 pounds to be held in an effectively weightless state, so it can be moved manually or with optional powered assistance, up or down, right or left, forward or backward and rotated around each axis (known as six degrees of motion freedom) by an operator using a modest amount of force or with a computer controlled pendant. The same design features enable the operator to dock the test head without causing inadvertent damage to the fragile electrical contacts. As a result, after testing a particular production lot of ICs, the operator can quickly and easily disconnect a test head that is held in an in2(R) or Cobal Series manipulator and equipped with our docking hardware and dock it to another electronic device handler for testing either a subsequent lot of the same packaged ICs or to test different ICs. With the LS Series manipulators, the undocking, movement of the test head and redocking can be done automatically through the pendant. Our manipulator products range in price from approximately $12,000 to $75,000.

Docking Hardware Products. We offer two lines of docking hardware products: fixed manual docking and IntelliDock pin and cup docking. Both types protect the delicate interface contacts and ensure proper repeatable and precise alignment between the test head's interface board and the prober's probing assembly or the handler's test socket as they are brought together, or "docked." Fixed manual docking includes a mechanical cam mechanism to dock and lock the test head to the prober or handler. IntelliDock is an automated docking solution that provides operator feedback for each docking step via a touchscreen display, and when coupled with the LS Series manipulator, redeployment of the test head can be done automatically and accurately via the computer pendant. Both types of docking hardware products eliminate motion of the test head relative to the prober or handler once docked. This minimizes deterioration of the interface boards, test sockets and probing assemblies that is caused by constant vibration during testing. Our docking hardware products are used primarily with floating-head universal manipulators when maximum mobility and inter-changeability of handlers and probers between test heads is required. By using our docking hardware products, semiconductor manufacturers can achieve cost savings through improved ATE utilization, improved accuracy and integrity of test results, optimized floor support and reduced repairs and replacements of expensive ATE interface products.

 We believe our docking hardware products offer our customers the ability to make various competing brands of test heads compatible with various brands of probers and handlers by only changing interface boards. This is called "plug-compatibility." Plug-compatibility enables increased flexibility and utilization of test heads, probers and handlers purchased from various ATE manufacturers. We believe that because we do not compete with ATE manufacturers in the sale of probers, handlers or testers, ATE manufacturers are willing to provide us with the information that is integral to the design of plug-compatible products. Our docking hardware products range in price from approximately $2,000 to $25,000.

Interface Products. Our tester interface products provide the electrical connections between the tester and the wafer prober or IC handler to carry the electrical signals between the tester and the probe card on the prober or the test socket on the handler. Our designs optimize the integrity of the transmitted signal. Therefore, our tester interfaces can be used with high speed, high frequency, digital or mixed signal testers used in testing more complex ICs. Because our tester interface products enable the tester to provide more reliable yield data, our interfaces may also reduce IC production costs. We design standard and modular interface products to address most possible tester/prober combinations on the market today. In addition, we provide a custom design service that will allow any of our customers to use virtually any tester, prober or handler combination with any type of device, such as analog, digital, mixed signal and radio frequency. For example, our Centaur(R) modular interface is designed to provide flexibility and scalability through the use of replaceable signal modules which can be easily changed on the test floor as our customers' testing requirements change. In addition to the Centaur(R) modular interface, we also offer over 200 different types of tester interface models that we custom designed for our customers' specific applications. These tester interface products range in price from approximately $7,000 to $110,000.

MARKETING, SALES AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT
 We market and sell our products primarily in markets where semiconductors are manufactured. North American and European semiconductor manufacturers, as well as third-party foundries, test and assembly providers, have located most of their back-end factories in Southeast Asia. The front-end wafer fabrication plants of U.S. semiconductor manufacturers are primarily in the U.S. Likewise, European, Taiwanese, South Korean and Japanese semiconductor manufacturers generally have located their wafer fabrication plants in their respective countries. We have been providing a greater number of engineered solutions to markets outside the Semi Market. These are thermal-based solutions that fall into the categories of test and process, involving automotive, defense/aerospace, industrial, medical and telecommunications markets.
Thermal Products: We market our thermal products brands, Temptronic, Sigma and Thermonics, under the umbrella name of inTEST Thermal Solutions and sales to ATE manufacturers are handled directly by our own sales force. Sales to semiconductor manufacturers and customers in other markets in the U.S. are handled through independent sales representative organizations. In Singapore and Malaysia, our sales and service are handled through our internal sales and service staff. In the rest of Asia, our sales are handled through distributors. In Europe, sales managers at our office in Germany, as well as regional distributors and independent sales representatives, sell to semiconductor manufacturers and customers in other markets. We communicate with our distributors regularly and have trained them to sell and service our thermal products.

 We market our EASYHEAT™ and EKOHEAT(R) precision induction heating equipment to manufacturers who require specialized industrial heating in a wide array of industries, including automotive, aerospace and semiconductor, and are sold globally through a combination of regional sales managers, independent sales representatives and independent distributors. In North America, direct regional sales managers provide sales coverage augmented by independent sales representatives. In Europe, direct sales managers provide sales coverage augmented by independent distributors. In Asia, distributors have responsibility for sales and service of our products. We generate a significant portion of our sales leads through our website as well as through trade show attendance. However, as a result of COVID-19, the majority of the trade shows we would have normally attended were either canceled or held virtually during 2020. We believe this negatively impacted our revenue for our induction heating products during 2020. We continue to focus on other methods of lead generation and expect that trade show attendance will resume in 2021.
 
We also provide induction heating product support through our SmartCARE Service offering, which includes equipment repairs and training, preventative maintenance, enhanced warranties and spare parts. Our field service engineers, located in the U.S. and Europe, provide service and support globally. Additionally, a number of distributors in Europe and Asia have factory-trained service technicians.

EMS Products: In North America, we sell to semiconductor manufacturers principally through independent, commissioned sales representatives. North American sales representatives also coordinate product installation and support with our technical staff and participate in trade shows. As a result of COVID-19, the majority of the trade shows we would have normally attended were either canceled or held virtually during 2020, however, unlike for our induction heating products, our sales lead generation activities are not significantly reliant on trade show attendance.

 Our internal sales account managers handle sales to ATE manufacturers and are responsible for a portfolio of customer accounts and for managing certain independent sales representatives. In addition, our sales account managers are responsible for pricing, quotations, proposals and transaction negotiations, and they assist with applications engineering and custom product design. Technical support is provided to North American customers and independent sales representatives by employees based in New Jersey, California and Texas.

 In Europe, we sell to semiconductor and ATE manufacturers through our internal sales staff. Technical support is provided by our staff in the U.K. In China, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand, we sell through the use of independent sales representatives who are supervised by our internal sales staff. In Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan, our sales are handled by our internal sales staff. International sales representatives are responsible for sales, installation, support and trade show participation in their geographic market areas. Technical support is provided to Asian customers primarily by employees based in Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan.
 
CUSTOMERS
 We market all of our products to end users including semiconductor manufacturers, third-party foundries and test and assembly providers, as well as to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), which include ATE manufacturers and their third-party outsource manufacturing partners. In the case of thermal products, we also market our products to independent testers of semiconductors, manufacturers of automotive, defense/aerospace, industrial, medical and telecommunications products, semiconductor research facilities, and manufacturers and manufacturing process integrators for a variety of industrial process applications. Our customers use our products principally in production testing or process/manufacturing applications, although our ThermoStream(R) products traditionally have been used largely in engineering development and quality assurance. We believe that we sell to most of the major semiconductor manufacturers in the world.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, no customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2019, Texas Instruments Incorporated accounted for 10% of our consolidated net revenues. While both of our operating segments sold products to this customer, these revenues were primarily generated by our EMS segment. During the year ended December 31, 2019, no other customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net revenues. Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 35% and 34% of our consolidated net revenues in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The loss of any one or more of our largest customers, or a reduction in orders by a major customer, could materially reduce our net revenues or otherwise materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
Our largest customers in 2020 include:

MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY
 
As of December 31, 2020, our principal manufacturing operations consisted of assembly and testing at our facilities in Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York. As discussed further in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements, during the fourth quarter of 2020, we transitioned the manufacturing of our tester interface products from our facility in Fremont, California to our facility in Mt. Laurel, New Jersey. We assemble most of our products from a combination of standard components and custom parts that have been fabricated to our specifications by either third-party manufacturers or our own fabrication operation in New Jersey. Our practice is to use the highest quality raw materials and components in our products. The primary raw materials used in fabricated parts are widely available. Substantially all of our components are purchased from multiple suppliers, however certain raw materials and components are sourced from single suppliers. Although, from time to time, certain components may be in short supply due to high demand or inability of vendors to meet quality or delivery requirements, we believe that all materials and components are available in adequate amounts from other sources.
 
We conduct inspections of incoming raw materials, fabricated parts and components using sophisticated measurement equipment. This includes testing with coordinate measuring machines in all but one of our manufacturing facilities to ensure that products with critical dimensions meet our specifications. We have designed our inspection standards to comply with applicable MIL specifications and ANSI standards.

 Our Massachusetts facility is ISO 9001:2015 certified. Our New York facility is ISO 9001:2015 certified. Our New Jersey facility manufacture products only for the semiconductor industry where ISO certification is not required. However, this location does employ the practices embodied in the ISO 9001:2008.

ENGINEERING AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
 Our success depends on our ability to provide our customers with products and solutions that are well engineered and to design those products and solutions before, or at least no later than, our competitors. As of December 31, 2020, we employed a total of 45 engineers engaged in engineering and product development. In addition, when the demands of engineering and product development projects exceed the capacity or knowledge of our in-house staff, we retain temporary third-party engineering and product development consultants to assist us. Our practice in many cases is to assign engineers to work with specific customers, thereby enabling us to develop the relationships and exchange of information that is most conducive to successful product development and enhancement. In addition, some of our engineers are assigned to new product research and development and have worked on such projects as the development of new types of universal manipulators, the redesign and development of new thermal products and the development of high-performance interfaces.

 Since most of our products are customized, we consider substantially all of our engineering activities to be engineering and product development. We spent approximately $5.0 million in each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 on engineering and product development.

PATENTS AND OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS
 Our policy is to protect our technology by filing patent applications for the technologies that we consider important to our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and unpatented know-how to protect our proprietary rights. It is our practice to require that all of our employees and third-party product development consultants assign to us all rights to inventions or other discoveries relating to our business that were made while working for us. In addition, all employees and third-party product development consultants agree not to disclose any private or confidential information relating to our technology, trade secrets or intellectual property.
 
As of December 31, 2020, we held 62 active U.S. patents and had two pending U.S. patent applications covering various aspects of our technology. Our U.S. patents expire at various times beginning in 2021 and extending through 2038. During 2020, two U.S. patents were issued and four U.S. patents expired. We do not believe that the upcoming expiration of certain of our patents in 2021 will have a material impact on our business. We also hold foreign patents and file foreign patent applications, in selected cases corresponding to our U.S. patents and patent applications, to the extent management deems appropriate.

 While we believe that our patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business, we also believe that, due to the rapid pace of technological change in the markets we serve, the successful manufacture and sale of our products also depends upon our engineering, manufacturing, marketing and servicing skills. In the absence of patent protection, we would be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy or imitate our products or processes. We believe our intellectual property has value, and we have taken in the past, and will take in the future, actions we deem appropriate to protect such property from misappropriation. There can be no assurance, however, that such actions will provide meaningful protection from competition. For additional information regarding risks related to our intellectual property, see the "Risk Factors" section of this Report.
 
COMPETITION
 We operate in an increasingly competitive environment within both of our operating segments. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources and more extensive design and production capabilities than us. Certain markets in which we operate have become more fragmented, with smaller companies entering the market. These new smaller entrants typically have much lower levels of fixed operating overhead than us, which enables them to be profitable with lower priced products. In order to remain competitive with these and other companies, we must continue to commit a significant portion of our personnel, financial resources, research and development and customer support to developing new products and maintaining customer relationships worldwide.

 Our competitors include independent manufacturers, ATE manufacturers and, to a lesser extent, semiconductor manufacturers' in-house ATE interface groups. Competitive factors in the markets we serve include price, functionality, timely product delivery, customer service, applications support, product performance and reliability. We believe that our long-term relationships with our customers in the various markets we support and our commitment to, and reputation for, providing high quality products, are important elements in our ability to compete effectively in all of our markets.
 
Our principal competitors for Thermostream(R) products are FTS Systems, a part of SP Industries, and MPI Corporation. Our principal competitors for environmental chambers are Cincinnati Sub-Zero Products, Inc., Espec Corp. and Thermotron Industries. Our principal competitor for thermal platforms is Environmental Stress Systems Inc. Our principal competitors for EKOHEAT(R) and EASYHEAT™ products are Inductotherm Corporation, Park-Ohio Holdings, EFD Induction Corporation, Trumpf Huettinger GmbH, Ultraflex Power Technologies and CEIA SpA.

 Our principal competitors for manipulator products are Advantest Corporation, Esmo AG, Reid-Ashman Manufacturing and Teradyne, Inc. Our principal competitors for docking hardware products include Advantest Corporation, Esmo AG, Knight Automation, Reid-Ashman Manufacturing and Teradyne, Inc. Our principal competitors for tester interface products are Advantest Corporation, Esmo AG, Reid-Ashman Manufacturing and Teradyne, Inc.

BACKLOG
 At December 31, 2020, our backlog of unfilled orders for all products was $11.5 million compared with $5.5 million at December 31, 2019. Our backlog includes customer orders that we have accepted, substantially all of which we expect to deliver in 2021. While backlog is calculated on the basis of firm purchase orders, a customer may cancel an order or accelerate or postpone currently scheduled delivery dates. Our backlog may be affected by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead times available from suppliers, including us, in periods of depressed demand. In periods of increased demand, there is a tendency towards longer lead times, which has the effect of increasing backlog. As a result of these factors, our backlog at a particular date is not necessarily indicative of sales for any future period.
EMPLOYEES
 At December 31, 2020, we had 204 employees (199 of which were full-time), including 112 in manufacturing operations, 54 in customer support/operations and 38 in administration. Substantially all of our key employees are highly skilled and trained technical personnel. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. From time to time, we retain third-party contractors to assist us in manufacturing operations and engineering and product development projects.
