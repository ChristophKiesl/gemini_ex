ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Star Equity, formerly Digirad Corporation, is a diversified, multi-industry holding company which currently operates in two important sectors of the U.S. economy, healthcare, and building & construction. Businesses within these divisions have their own experienced management teams, but are 100% controlled by us through wholly-owned subsidiaries, Digirad Health, Inc. and ATRM Holdings, Inc. Over time, we will consider investing in additional operating businesses and potentially entering additional industry sectors. We also maintain a third division, an internally-focused entity, which holds our corporate real estate and investments and is directly managed at the holding company level.
As of December 31, 2020, we operate the Company in four reportable segments in continuing operations: Diagnostic Services, Diagnostic Imaging, Building and Construction, and Real Estate and Investments.
•Digirad Health: provides medical imaging services and also designs, manufactures, services, and distributes diagnostic medical imaging equipment. Star Equity’s direct and indirect subsidiaries included in this division (including Digirad Health, Inc.) are referred to collectively herein as the “Healthcare Subsidiaries.” 
•The Diagnostic Services business segment offers imaging services to healthcare providers, primarily cardiology practices, as an alternative to purchasing the equipment or outsourcing the procedure. 
•The Diagnostic Imaging business segment develops, sells, and services solid-state mobile gamma imaging cameras to hospitals and physicians.
•Star Building & Construction segment: designs, manufactures, and distributes wood-based products used in residential and commercial construction projects. KBS Builders, Inc. (“KBS”), EdgeBuilder, Inc. (“EdgeBuilder”), and Glenbrook Building Supply, Inc. (“Glenbrook”) are wholly owned subsidiaries of Star Equity and are referred to collectively herein, and together with ATRM Holdings, Inc. (“ATRM”), as the “Construction Subsidiaries” and the “Building & Construction businesses.”
•Our KBS business primarily manufactures modular housing units, mainly for the New England market, at our production facility in South Paris, ME. In 2020, we entered the structural wall panel business at a second modular production facility in Oxford, ME. We are continually evaluating the possibility of opening a second modular line at the Oxford, ME facility as demand for our product increases. Opening and operating a second modular manufacturing facility should become necessary as we continue pursuing larger commercial-scale multi-family projects, in addition to producing single-family homes.
•Our EdgeBuilder and Glenbrook businesses in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area (referred to collectively herein as “EBGL”) together manufacture structural wall panels, permanent wood foundation systems, and other engineered wood products, and supply general contractors with building materials.
•Star Real Estate & Investments segment: manages and finances our more significant corporate real estate assets and would hold any potential minority investment positions we might make in the future. Currently, our only revenue-generating activity in this segment is the intercompany monthly rent eliminated during consolidation received from our affiliate, KBS, which leases 3 modular factories from Star Real Estate Holdings USA, Inc. (“SRE”). Star Equity’s direct and indirect subsidiaries included in this division are SRE, 947 Waterford Road, LLC (“947 Waterford”), 300 Park Street, LLC (“300 Park”), 56 Mechanic Falls Road, LLC (“56 Mechanic”) and Loan Star Value Management, LLC (“LSVM”). Star Real Estate & Investments are referred to collectively herein “Real Estate and Investments”.
Strategy
Star Equity
We believe our diversified, multi-industry holding company structure will allow Star Equity management to focus on capital allocation, strategic leadership, merger and acquisition, capital markets transactions, investor relations, management of our real estate & investments, and other public company activities. Our structural plan will free up our operating Chief Executive Officers to manage their respective businesses, look for organic and bolt-on growth opportunities and improve operations with less distraction and administrative burden.
We continue to explore strategic alternatives to improve the market position and profitability of our product offerings in the marketplace, generate additional liquidity, and enhance our valuation. We may pursue our goals through organic growth and through strategic alternatives. Some of these alternatives have included, and could continue to include, selective acquisitions of business segments or entire businesses, divestitures of assets or divisions, or a restructuring of our company.
Operating Businesses
We seek to grow our business by, among other things:
•Organic growth from our core businesses. We believe that we operate in markets and geographies that will allow us to continue to grow our core businesses, allowing us to benefit from our scale and strengths. We plan to focus our efforts on markets in which we already have a presence in order to take advantage of personnel, infrastructure, and brand recognition we have in these areas.
•Introduction of new services. In the Digirad Health division we plan to continue to focus on healthcare solutions related businesses that deliver necessary assets, services and logistics directly to the customer site. We believe that over time we can either purchase or develop new and complementary businesses and take advantage of our customer loyalty and distribution channels. In the Star Building & Construction division, we will consider opportunities to augment our service offering to better serve our customer base. We have done this in the New England market by adding a structural wall panel line. Other areas might include logistics, installation on site, and manufacturing of sub-components or enhancements that create even more complete modules, such as full HVAC installation.
•Acquisition of complementary businesses. We plan to continue to look at complementary businesses that meet our internally developed financially disciplined approach for acquisitions to grow our company. We believe there are many potential small targets that can be acquired over time and integrated into our platform. We will also look at larger, more transformational acquisitions (public or private) if we believe the appropriate mix of value, risk and return is present for our shareholders. The timing of these potential acquisitions will always depend on market conditions, available capital, and the value for each transaction. In general, we want to be “value” buyers, and will not pursue any transaction unless we believe the post-transaction potential value is high for shareholders.
We continue to explore strategic alternatives to improve the market position and profitability of our product offerings in the marketplace, generate additional liquidity, and enhance our valuation. We may pursue our goals through organic growth and through strategic alternatives. Some of these alternatives have included, and could continue to include, selective acquisitions of business segments or entire businesses, divestitures of assets or divisions, or a restructuring of our company.
Star Real Estate & Investments
The Star Real Estate & Investments business is currently an internally-focused division, also referred to internally as SRE, that is directly managed by Star Equity management. SRE directly owns our three manufacturing facilities in Maine, which are leased to KBS. We have financed these facilities in order to generate proceeds to be used for working capital purposes at our Construction Subsidiaries.
Business Segments
As of December 31, 2020, our three divisions are organized into four reportable segments as it relates to continuing operations. These include: Diagnostic Services and Diagnostic Imaging, which together constitute our health care business, known as Digirad Health, and our two newer segments, Building & Construction, and Real Estate & Investments. See Note 17. Segments, within the notes to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for financial data relating to our segments. 
For discussion purposes, we categorized our Diagnostic Imaging, and Diagnostic Services reportable segments as “Healthcare”. For the last two fiscal years, Healthcare had the following relative contribution to consolidated revenues:

 | Year ended December 31,

Real Estate and Investments | 0.1 | % | | 0.1 | %
Total Real Estate and Investments | 0.1 | % | | 0.1 | %

Detailed Description of Our Operating Segments
Digirad Health
Diagnostic imaging depictions of the internal anatomy or physiology are generated primarily through non-invasive means. Diagnostic imaging facilitates the early diagnosis of diseases and disorders, often minimizing the scope, cost, and amount of care required and reducing the need for more invasive procedures. Currently, the major types of non-invasive diagnostic imaging technologies available are: x-ray, MRI, CT, ultrasound, PET, and nuclear imaging. The most widely used imaging acquisition technology utilizing gamma cameras is single photon emission computed tomography, or SPECT. Our current internally-developed cardiac gamma cameras employ SPECT technology. Digirad Health is comprised of two segments that specialize in delivering SPECT in a unique and effective manner in order to deliver convenient healthcare solutions on an AS needed, WHEN needed and WHERE needed basis.
Diagnostic Services
Through Diagnostic Services, we offer a convenient and economically efficient imaging services program as an alternative to purchasing equipment or outsourcing the procedures to another physician or imaging center. For physicians who wish to perform nuclear imaging, echocardiography, vascular or general ultrasound tests, we provide imaging systems, qualified personnel, radiopharmaceuticals, licensing services, and the logistics required to perform imaging in their own offices, and thereby the ability to bill Medicare, Medicaid, or one of the third-party healthcare insurers directly for those services, which are primarily cardiac in nature. We provide imaging services primarily to cardiologists, internal medicine physicians, and family practice doctors who typically enter into annual contracts for a set number of days ranging from once per month to five times per week. Many of our physician customers are reliant on reimbursements from Medicare, Medicaid, and third-party insurers. Although reimbursement for procedures provided by our services have been stable during the last several years, any future changes to underlying reimbursements may require modifications to our current business model in order for us to maintain a viable economic model.
Our portable nuclear and ultrasound imaging operations utilize a “hub and spoke” model in which centrally located regional hubs anchor multiple van routes in the surrounding metropolitan areas. At these hubs, clinical personnel load the equipment, radiopharmaceuticals, and other supplies onto specially equipped vans for transport to customer locations, where they set up the equipment for the day. After quality assurance testing, a technologist under the physician’s supervision will gather patient information, inject the patient with a radiopharmaceutical, and then acquire images for interpretation by the physician. At the conclusion of the day of service, all equipment and supplies are removed from the customer location and transported back to the central hub location. Our model relies on density and customer concentration to allow for efficiencies and maximum profitability, and therefore we are only located in geographies where there is a high concentration of people, cardiac disease and associated likely customer locations.
For our nuclear imaging services, we have obtained Radsite Intersocietal Accreditation Commission (“IAC”) and Intersocietal Commission for Echocardiography Laboratories (“ICAEL”) accreditation for our services. Our licensing infrastructure provides radioactive materials licensing, radiation safety officer services, radiation safety training, monitoring and compliance policies and procedures, and quality assurance functions, to ensure adherence to applicable state and federal nuclear regulations.
Diagnostic Imaging
Through Diagnostic Imaging, we sell our internally developed solid-state gamma cameras, imaging systems and camera maintenance contracts. Our imaging systems include nuclear cardiac imaging systems, as well as general purpose nuclear imaging systems. We sell our imaging systems to physician offices and hospitals primarily in the United States, although we have sold a small number of imaging systems internationally. Our imaging systems are sold in both portable and fixed configurations, provide enhanced operability and improved patient comfort, fit easily into floor spaces as small as seven feet by eight feet, and facilitate the delivery of nuclear medicine procedures in a physician’s office, an outpatient hospital setting, or within multiple departments of a hospital (e.g., emergency and operating rooms). Our Diagnostic Imaging segment revenues derive primarily from selling solid-state gamma cameras and post-warranty camera maintenance contracts. 
The central component of a nuclear camera is the detector, which ultimately determines the overall clinical quality of images a camera produces. Our nuclear cameras feature detectors with advanced proprietary solid-state technology developed by us. Solid-state systems have a number of benefits over conventional photomultiplier tube-based camera designs typically offered by our competitors. Our solid-state technology systems are typically 2 to 5 times lighter and considerably more compact than most traditional nuclear systems, making them far easier and less costly to build, very reliable, and able to be utilized for mobile applications. We are a market leader in the mobile solid-state nuclear camera segment.
We believe our current imaging systems, with their state-of-the-art technology and robust underlying patents, will continue to be relevant for the foreseeable future. We will continue to enhance and adjust our existing systems for the changing nuclear imaging market, including software upgrades and smaller enhancements. However, to accomplish any significant changes and enhancements, we will utilize what we believe is a deep available pool of contract engineers on a flexible, as needed basis and do not maintain a fully staffed research and development department.
Star Building & Construction
The building and construction industries lag behind many other manufacturing industry sectors with respect to offsite production. Both modular and prefabricated structural wall panels, produced offsite, are gaining market share in a sector still dominated by more traditional onsite or “stick built” construction. 
KBS has been in the modular business since 2001 and primarily services the New England market, including Cape Cod and the islands of Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket, as it is typically not cost-effective to ship modules beyond 300 miles from where they are produced do to their size and weight. We see opportunity for single-family modular homes across our target geography. The opportunity in commercial-scale multi-family modular projects is focused in and around the Boston metropolitan area, although we believe there will be increasing interest in other secondary cities and more densely settled areas. The shortage of affordable housing is a nation-wide challenge and we believe modular construction methods offer a compelling option to help address upfront construction costs, ongoing domestic energy costs, and time-to-market concerns associated with solving this challenge.
EBGL benefits from the same macro drivers towards more factory-built construction. The target market for the structural wall panels it produces is the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area where the need for housing has been growing. EBGL’s panels are sold to builders constructing multi-story, multi-unit structures, including senior living facilities and apartment buildings. Our wood foundations are sold primarily to builders of single family home developments. On the building products distribution side, our showroom and lumber yard focuses on professional builder sales and also provides loose lumber and materials that are bundled with our structural wall panel contracts to streamline the procurement process for these commercial customers. We also supply windows, doors, roofing, decking, drywall, hardware, and other value added products.
EBGL markets its engineered structural wall panels and permanent wood foundation systems through direct sales people and a network of builders, contractors and developers in and around Minneapolis and St. Paul areas. EBGL’s direct sales organization is responsible for both residential and commercial projects and it works with general contractors, developers and builders to provide bids and quotes for specific projects. Our marketing efforts include participation in industry trade shows, production of product literature, and sales support tools. These efforts are designed to generate sales leads for our independent builders and dealers, and direct salespeople.
Our Competitive Strengths
Healthcare Services and Products
Digirad Health delivers convenient, effective, and efficient healthcare solutions on an as needed, when needed, and where needed basis through our mobile products and services. Digirad Health’s diverse portfolio of mobile healthcare solutions and diagnostic imaging equipment and services provides hospitals, physician practices, and imaging centers throughout the United States access to technology and services necessary to provide patient care in the rapidly changing healthcare environment.
We believe that our competitive strengths are our streamlined and cost-efficient approach to providing healthcare solutions to our customers at the point of need, while providing an array of industry-leading, technologically-relevant healthcare imaging and monitoring services:
•Broad Portfolio of Imaging Services. Approximately 50.2% of our revenues are derived from diagnostic imaging services to our customers. We have developed and continue to refine an industry-leading, customer-service focused approach to our customers. We have found our focus in this area is a key factor in acquiring and retaining our service-based customers.
•Unique Dual Sales and Service Offering. For the majority of our businesses, we offer a service-based model to our customers, allowing them to avoid making costly capital and logistical investments required to offer these services internally. Further, for a portion of our business, we have the ability to sell the underlying capital equipment directly to our customers should their needs change and they desire to provide services on their own with the underlying capital equipment. This ability to serve our customers in a variety of capacities from selling equipment directly, or providing more flexibility through a service-based model, allows us to serve our customers according to their exact needs, as well as the ability to capture both ends of the revenue spectrum.
•Utilization of Highly Trained Staff. We recruit and maintain highly trained staff for our clinical and repair services, which in turn allows us to provide superior and more efficient services.
•Leading Solid-State Technology. Our solid-state gamma cameras utilize proprietary photo detector modules that enable us to build smaller and lighter cameras that are portable with a degree of ruggedness that can withstand the vibration associated with transportation. Our dedicated cardiac imagers require a floor space as little as seven feet by eight feet, can generally be installed without facility renovations, and use standard power. Our portable cameras are ideal for mobile operators or practices desiring to service multiple office locations or imaging facilities. 
Construction Services and Products
Our competitive strengths at KBS include our strategic location with respect to the Greater Boston and broader New England market, the largest manufacturing capacity in the New England region, and an ability to provide high quality wood-based volumetric modules for both single and commercial scale multi-family residential buildings. We also provide significant value through our longstanding engineering and design expertise, with a focus on customization to suit the specific project requirements. We continue to develop our expertise and specialized knowledge in the area of high energy efficient passive homes which includes the delivery of our first zero energy modular (“ZEM”) homes to address the need for affordable housing during 2020. We also added structural wall panels to our product offering in 2020, allowing us to provide an alternative product when modular units are not the right solution. We believe structural wall panels may help facilitate the adoption of offsite construction solutions for some traditional builders who have historically focused on onsite “stick-built” construction.
At EBGL, we also have the ability to offer a superior product for commercial scale multi-family projects. Our engineering and design capabilities allow us to create a product that is unique to the specific project’s requirements. We also provide value with our vertically integrated in-house delivery capability, helping us to be cost-competitive. Our production strategy is to utilize automation and the most efficient methods of manufacturing and high-quality materials in all EBGL projects. Through our building products distribution business we operate a professional lumber yard and showroom and deliver highly personalized service, knowledgeable salespeople, and attention to detail that the larger, big-box chain home stores do not provide.
Sales
Healthcare
We maintain separate sales organizations that are aligned with each of our business units, which operate independently but in cooperation with each other. Diagnostic Services concentrates its efforts on twelve regional areas where the majority of our business is concentrated based on concentrations of people and cardiac disease. Diagnostic Imaging sales efforts are conducted throughout the United States and certain foreign countries, and are not concentrated to any particular region or area within the United States as the customer profile for this business can be at any hospital or physician practice. Diagnostic Services and Diagnostic Imaging, though separate sales teams, work collaboratively to help fulfill customer needs through either small practice mobile nuclear cardiac imaging services, or to provide capital equipment sales should the customer decide to own the equipment in house.
Building & Construction
KBS markets its modular homes products through both outside and inside salespeople. Our inside sales team works primarily with our network of independent dealers who source end customers for single family homes largely in Northern New England. Our outside sales team prospects for single-family residential and commercial multi-unit projects through new and established relationships with architects, designers, developers, owners builders, general contractors, consultants, and construction managers throughout New England. Their work involves developing and negotiating the full scope of work for KBS, terms of payment, and general requirements for each project.
EBGL markets its engineered structural wall panels and permanent wood foundation systems through direct sales people and a network of builders, contractors and developers in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area and the Upper Midwest states. EBGL’s direct sales organization is responsible for both residential and commercial projects. Our marketing efforts include participation in industry trade shows, production of product literature, and sales support tools. Our showroom and lumber yard services walk-in traffic, mainly professional builders but also homeowner’s, through in house sales clerks.
Competition
Healthcare
The market for diagnostic products and services is highly competitive. Our business, which is focused primarily on the private practice and hospital sectors, continues to face challenges of demand for diagnostic services and imaging equipment, which we believe is due in part to the impact of the Deficit Reduction Act on the reimbursement environment and the 2010 Healthcare Reform laws, as well as general uncertainty in overall healthcare and legislative changes in healthcare, such as the Affordable Care Act. These challenges have impacted, and will likely continue to impact, our operations. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include acceptance by hospitals and physicians, relationships that we develop with our customers, budget availability for our capital equipment, requirements for reimbursement, pricing, ease-of-use, reliability, and mobility.
Diagnostic Services. In providing diagnostic imaging services, we compete against many smaller local and regional nuclear and ultrasound providers that may have lower operating costs. The fixed-installation operators often utilize older, used equipment, and the mobile operators may use older Digirad single-head cameras or newer dual-head cameras. We are the only mobile provider with our own exclusive source of triple-head mobile systems. Some competing operators place new or used cameras into physician offices and then provide the staffing, supplies, and other support as an alternative to a Diagnostic Services service contract. In addition, we compete against imaging centers that install fixed nuclear gamma cameras and make them available to referring physicians in their geographic vicinity. In these cases, the physician sends their patients to the imaging center.
Diagnostic Imaging. In selling our imaging systems, we compete against several large medical device manufacturers who offer a full line of imaging cameras for each diagnostic imaging technology, including x-ray, MRI, CT, ultrasound, nuclear medicine, or SPECT/CT and PET/CT hybrid imagers. The existing nuclear imaging systems sold by these competitors have been in use for a longer period of time than our internally developed nuclear gamma cameras, and are more widely recognized and used by physicians and hospitals; however, they are generally not solid-state, light-weight, as flexible, or portable. Additionally, certain medical device companies have developed a version of solid-state gamma cameras that may directly compete with our product offerings. Many of the larger multi-modality competitors enjoy significant competitive advantages over us, including greater brand recognition, greater financial and technical resources, established relationships with healthcare professionals, broader distribution networks, more resources for product development and marketing and sales, and the ability to bundle products to offer discounts.
Building & Construction
The market for building and construction is highly competitive. 
KBS is a regional manufacturer of modular housing units with its primary market in the New England states. Several modular manufacturers are located in these New England states and in nearby Pennsylvania. Some competitors have manufacturing locations in Canada and ship their products to the United States. KBS’s competitors include Apex Homes, Commodore Corporation, Skyline Champion Homes, Custom Building Systems, Durabuilt, Excel Homes, Huntington Homes, Icon Legacy Homes, Kent Homes (Canada), Maple Leaf Homes (Canada), Muncy Homes, New Era, Pennwest, Premier Builders (PA), Professional Builders Systems, Preferred Building Systems / New England Homes, RCM (Canada), Redmond Homes, Ritz-Craft, Simplex Homes, and Westchester Modular. 
EBGL is a regional manufacturer of engineered structural wall panels and permanent wood foundation systems, and also has a local retail business. EBGL’s market is primarily the Upper Midwest states (Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin). EBGL’s competitors include Precision Wall Systems, Component Manufacturing Company, JL Schwieters Construction, Arrow Building Center, and Marshall Truss Systems Incorporated. EBGL’s professional building supply business competes on a local level against both small, local lumber yards, regional building supply companies, and to a certain degree, the “big box” stores such as Home Depot, Lowe’s, and Menard’s.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements, and other measures to protect our intellectual property. We require our employees, consultants, and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements and to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived during the workday, using our property, or which relate to our business. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. As discussed herein, Digirad Health intellectual property is currently subject to a security interest under the credit facility with Sterling. 
ATRM’s intellectual property is currently subject to a security interest under the credit facility with Gerber Finance Inc. (“Gerber”).
Patents
We have developed a patent portfolio that covers our products, components, and processes. We have 14 non-expired U.S. patents. The patents cover, among other things, aspects of solid-state radiation detectors that make it possible for the Company to provide mobile imaging services, and our scan technology that provides for lower patient doses and more specific cardiac images. Our patents expire between 2021 (U.S. Patent 6,670,258) and 2030 (U.S. Patent 8,362,438). While each of our patents applies to nuclear medicine, many also apply to the construction of area detectors for other types of medical and non-medical imagers and imaging methods.
We do not hold any patents within our Building & Construction business.
Trademarks and Copyrights
Our registered trademark portfolio consists of registrations in the United States for Digirad® and CARDIUS®. The Company has produced proprietary software for Digirad Imaging systems including: nSPEED™ 3D-OSEM Reconstruction, SEEQUANTA™ acquisition, and STASYS™ motion correction software. We also license certain software products, and their related copyrights, on a nonexclusive basis from Cedars-Sinai Health System. The license includes updates to the software. The license may be terminated at any time by either party upon notice if the other party materially breaches the agreement. Non-payment to licensor is considered a material breach. The license may also be automatically terminated by licensor if (i) an “event of default” occurs under indebtedness for borrowed money of licensee; (ii) licensee ceases business operations; (iii) licensee dissolves or (iv) licensee commences bankruptcy proceedings. On May 23, 2018, the parties entered into an amendment to the license agreement to, among other things, extend the term of license through July 1, 2023.
Raw Materials
Diagnostic Imaging. We and our contract manufacturers use a wide variety of materials, metals, and mechanical and electrical components for production of our nuclear imaging gamma cameras. These materials are primarily purchased from external suppliers, some of which are single-source suppliers. Materials are purchased from selected suppliers based on quality assurance, cost effectiveness, and constraints resulting from regulatory requirements, and we work closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. Global commodity supply and demand can ultimately affect pricing of certain of these raw materials. Though we believe we have adequate available sources of raw materials, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to access the quantity of raw material needed to sustain operations, as well as at a cost-effective price.
Diagnostic Services. Our Diagnostic Services operations utilize radiopharmaceuticals for our nuclear services. The underlying raw material for creation of the array of doses utilized in nuclear medicine is produced from a total of five main production facilities throughout the world, typically from highly enriched uranium resources. These resources have been and are expected to continue to produce enough raw materials to address the global market, but there continues to be pressure to utilize low or non-enriched uranium resources to produce the underlying nuclear doses. 
Building and Construction. Both KBS and EBGL operate in the wood-based building and construction market. The primary raw materials used in their production processes include dimensional lumber, mainly spruce-pine-fir (SPF), and sheathing/sheet goods (OSB and plywood). The majority of underlying raw material for both KBS and EBGL are sourced by wholesalers and mills locally, but we also from time to time source nationally and from Canada. Both businesses depend on the reliability of the lumber supply chain and are sensitive to varying degrees around wood-based commodity price fluctuations.
Manufacturing
Diagnostic Imaging. We manufacture our nuclear imaging gamma cameras by employing a strategy that combines using internal manufacturing resources for devices requiring specific expertise due to our proprietary design coupled with qualified contract manufacturers. Mechanical and electronic components of our systems are produced by contract manufacturers, whereas the most complex components, final assembly and final system performance tests are performed at our facility. All of our suppliers of critical materials, components, and subassemblies undergo supplier qualifications and ongoing quality audits in accordance with our supplier quality process.
We and our contract manufacturers are subject to FDA Quality System Regulations, state regulations, and standards set by the International Organization for Standardization, or ISO. We are currently certified to the EN ISO 13485:2016 quality standard. We have received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) 510(k) clearance for our complete nuclear imaging camera product line (Cardius® XPO, Cardius® X-ACT, and Ergo™ gamma cameras). In addition, the X-ACT camera utilizes an x-ray technology to provide attenuation correction information for the SPECT reconstruction. We also have received additional FDA clearance of our Ergo™ large-field-of-view General Purpose Imager for use in intraoperative and molecular breast imaging.
Building and Construction. KBS began manufacturing single family homes in 2001 and commercial modular multi-family housing units in 2008. In subsequent years, KBS expanded its product offerings to include a variety of commercial buildings including apartments, condominiums, townhouses, dormitories, hospitals, office buildings, and other structures. The structures are built inside our climate-controlled factories and are then transported to the site where they are set, assembled and secured on the foundation. Electrical, plumbing, and HVAC systems are inspected and tested in the factory, prior to transportation to the site, to ensure the modules meet all local building codes and quality requirements. Modular construction has gained increased acceptance and is a preferred method of building by many architects and general contractors. The advantages of modular construction include: modules are constructed in a climate-controlled environment; weather conditions usually do not interrupt or delay construction; the building is protected from weather, reducing the risk of mold due to materials absorbing moisture from rain or snow; reduced site work; improved safety and security; reduced vandalism and attrition, as the building is immediately secured; and a significant reduction in overall project time. 
EBGL consists of two separate companies (EdgeBuilder (“EB”) and Glenbrook (“GL”)) operating in tandem with a common management team. EdgeBuilder manufactures wall panels and permanent wood foundations (PWF) in a climate-controlled factory, then transports the panels to the construction site via flat-bed trucks. The panels are typically unloaded by crane and erected or assembled, on site, by professional framing contractors. Panelized construction, especially in large-scale, multi-unit projects, is becoming increasingly popular due to the heightened demand on construction labor. Additionally, because the wall panels are constructed in a controlled indoor environment, waste, weather related delays, and mistakes are minimized. This shaves weeks off large, multi-unit construction schedules, leaving room for more annual builds. Glenbrook fills in all the areas where EdgeBuilder leaves off, with Glenbrook’s vast offerings of professional building products. As International Building Code® continues to evolve, KBS and EBGL, along with our professional partners in the industry, meet code changes with innovative products and a dedicated staff for adherent builds.
Healthcare Reimbursement
All of Digirad Health customers typically rely primarily on the Medicare and Medicaid programs and private payors for reimbursement. As a result, demand for our products and services are dependent in part on the coverage and reimbursement policies of these payors. Third party coverage and reimbursement is subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign regulation, and private payor rules and policies. In many instances, the applicable regulations, policies, and rules have not been definitively interpreted by regulatory authorities or the courts, are open to a variety of interpretations, and are subject to change without notice.
The scope of coverage and payment policies vary among third-party private payors. For example, some payors will not reimburse a provider unless the provider has a contract with the payor, and in many instances such payors will not enter into such contracts without the approval of a third party “radiology benefit manager” that the payor compensates based on reducing the payor’s imaging expense. Other payors prohibit reimbursement unless physicians own or lease our cameras on a full-time basis, or meet certain accreditation or privileging standards. Such payor requirements and limitations can significantly restrict the types of business models we can successfully utilize.
Medicare reimbursement rules are subject to annual changes that may affect payment for services that our customers provide. In addition, Congress has passed healthcare reform proposals that are intended to expand the availability of healthcare coverage and reduce the growth in healthcare spending in the U.S. Many of these laws affect the services that our customers provide, and could change further over time.
Medicare reimbursement rules impose many standards and policies on the payment of services that our customers provide. For instance, physicians billing for the technical component of nuclear imaging tests must be accredited by a government-approved independent accreditation body and many private payors are adopting similar requirements. We offer our customers a service to assist them in obtaining and maintaining the required accreditation. We believe we have structured our contracts in a manner that allows our customers to seek reimbursement from third-party payors in compliance with Medicare reimbursement rules. Our physician customers typically bill for both the technical and professional components of the tests. Assuming they meet certain requirements including, but not limited to, performing and documenting bona fide interpretations and providing the requisite supervision of the non-physician personnel performing the tests, they may bill and be paid by Medicare. If the failure to comply is deemed to be “knowing” or “willful,” the government could seek to impose fines or penalties, and we may be required to restructure our agreements and/or respond to any resultant claims by such customers or the government. Our hospital customers typically seek reimbursement by Medicare for outpatient services under the Medicare Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System.
Government Regulation
Healthcare
We and our medical professional customers must comply with an array of federal and state laws and regulations. Violations of such laws and regulations can be punishable by criminal, civil, and/or administrative sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Accordingly, we maintain a vigorous compliance program and a hotline that permits our personnel to report violations anonymously if they wish.
The following is a summary of some of the laws and regulations applicable to our business:
•Anti-Kickback Laws. The Medicare/Medicaid Patient Protection Act of 1987, as amended, which is commonly referred to as the Anti-Kickback Statute, prohibits us from knowingly and willingly offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any form of remuneration in return for the referral of items or services, or to purchase, lease, order, or arrange for or recommend purchasing, leasing, or ordering any good, facility, service, or item, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program. Violation of the federal anti-kickback law is a felony, punishable by criminal fines and imprisonment, or both, and can result in civil penalties and exclusion from participation in healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Many states have adopted similar statutes prohibiting payments intended to induce referrals of products or services paid by Medicaid or other nongovernmental third-party payors.
•Physician Self-Referral Laws. Federal regulations commonly referred to as the “Stark Law” prohibit physician referrals of Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity for certain designated health services if the physician or an immediate family member has an indirect or direct financial relationship with the entity, unless a statutory exception applies. We believe that referrals made by our physician customers are eligible to qualify for the “in-office ancillary services” exception to the Stark Law, provided that the services are provided or supervised by the physician or a member of his or her “Group Practice,” as that term is defined under the law, the services are performed in the same building in which the physician regularly practices medicine, and the services are billed by or for the supervising physician or Group Practice. Violations of the Stark Law may lead to the imposition of penalties and fines, the exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and liability under the federal False Claims Act and its whistleblower provisions. Many states have adopted similar statutes prohibiting self-referral arrangements that cover all patients and not just Medicare and Medicaid patients.
•HIPAA. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, prohibits schemes to defraud healthcare benefit programs and fraudulent conduct in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items, or services. HIPAA also establishes standards governing electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of individually identifiable health information. Some states have also enacted privacy and security statutes or regulations that, in some cases, are more stringent than those issued under HIPAA.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, enacted February 17, 2009, made significant changes to HIPAA privacy and security regulations. Effective February 17, 2010, we are regulated directly under all of the HIPAA rules protecting the security of electronic individually identifiable health information and many of the rules governing the privacy of such information.
•Medical Device Regulation. The FDA classifies medical devices, such as our cameras, into one of three classes, depending on the degree of risk associated with the device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Devices deemed to pose lower risk are placed in either class I or II, which generally requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a pre-market notification requesting permission for commercial distribution. This process is known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting, or implantable devices, are placed in Class III, requiring an approved Premarket Approval Application (“PMA”). Our cameras are Class II medical devices that have been cleared for marketing by the FDA. We are also subject to post-market regulatory requirements relating to our manufacturing process, marketing and sales activities, product performance, and medical device reports should there be deaths and serious injuries associated with our products.
•Pharmaceutical Regulation. Federal and state agencies, including the FDA and state pharmacy boards, regulate the radiopharmaceuticals used in our Diagnostic Services business.
•Radioactive Materials Laws. We must maintain licensure under, and comply with, federal and state radioactive materials laws, or RAM laws. RAM laws require, among other things, that radioactive materials are used by, or that their use be supervised by, individuals with specified training, expertise, and credentials and include specific provisions applicable to the medical use of radioactive materials.
•Environmental Matters. The facilities we operate or manage generate hazardous and medical waste subject to federal and state requirements regarding handling and disposal. We believe that the facilities that we operate and manage are currently in compliance in all material respects with applicable federal, state and local statutes and ordinances regulating the handling and disposal of such materials. We do not believe that we will be required to expend any material additional amounts in order to remain in compliance with these laws and regulations or that compliance will materially affect our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of 636 full time employees in all our divisions, of which 335 were employed in clinical health-related positions, 127 in manufacturing, 82 in operational roles, 66 in general and administrative functions, and 26 in marketing and sales. All positions are in the United States. We also utilize varying amounts of temporary workers as necessary to fulfill customer requirements. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good.
Recent History of our Business Transformation
On September 10, 2018 we announced that our Board had approved the conversion of the Company into a diversified holding company. We also announced simultaneously that our intent was to make ATRM Holdings, Inc., a building & construction business, our initial “kick-off” transaction.
On December 14, 2018, the Company and ATRM entered into a joint venture and formed Star Procurement, LLC (“Star Procurement”), with the Company and ATRM each holding a 50% interest in Star Procurement. The purpose of the joint venture is to provide the service of purchasing and selling building materials and related goods to KBS with which Star Procurement entered into a Services Agreement on January 2, 2019. In accordance with the terms of the Star Procurement Limited Liability Company Agreement, the Company made a $1.0 million capital contribution to the joint venture in January 2019. This entity was subsequently consolidated within the consolidated financial statements upon completion of the ATRM Merger.
In April 2019, as an initial transaction to create the Company’s real estate division under SRE, the Company funded the initial purchase of three modular building manufacturing facilities in Maine and then leased those three properties to KBS. The initial funding of the acquisition of these assets was primarily through the use of excess borrowing capacity on the credit facility with Sterling National Bank (“Sterling” or “SNB”), a national banking association.
On September 10, 2019 (the “ATRM Acquisition Date”), Star Equity completed its acquisition of ATRM pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 3, 2019 (the “ATRM Merger Agreement”), among Star Equity, Digirad Acquisition Corporation, a Minnesota corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Star Equity (“Merger Sub”), and ATRM. Under the terms of the ATRM Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into ATRM, with ATRM surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Star Equity (the “ATRM Merger” or “ATRM Acquisition”). ATRM is now doing business as Star Building & Construction. This “kick-off” transaction marked the official launch of Digirad Corporation, now Star Equity Holdings, Inc., as a diversified, multi-industry holding company.
At the effective time of the ATRM Merger, (i) each share of ATRM common stock was converted into the right to receive three one-hundredths (0.03) of a share of 10.0% Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (Company Preferred Stock) and (ii) each share of ATRM 10.00% Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (ATRM Preferred Stock) converted into the right to receive two and one-half (2.5) shares of Company Preferred Stock, for an approximate aggregate total of 1.6 million shares of Company Preferred Stock. No fractional shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued to any ATRM shareholder in the ATRM Merger. Each ATRM shareholder who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Company common stock in the ATRM Merger received one whole share of Company Preferred Stock. Upon the effectiveness of the ATRM Merger, each share of ATRM Common Stock and each share of ATRM Preferred Stock issued and outstanding were no longer be outstanding and automatically were canceled and retired and ceased to exist. ATRM held a special meeting of its shareholders at which the holders of ATRM Common Stock and ATRM Preferred Stock, voting as separate classes, approved the ATRM Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the ATRM Merger.
On October 30, 2020, Star Equity entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “DMS Purchase Agreement”) by and among Star Equity, Project Rendezvous Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Star Equity (“Seller”), DMS Health Technologies, Inc., a North Dakota corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Seller (“DMS Health”), and Knob Creek Acquisition Corp., a Tennessee corporation (“Buyer”) pursuant to which, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, Buyer will purchase all of the issued and outstanding common stock of DMS Health, which operates the Mobile Healthcare business, from Seller (the “DMS Sale Transaction”). As a result of the entry into the DMS Purchase Agreement, as of December 31, 2020, the Mobile Healthcare business met the criteria to be classified as held for sale and is reported on the Consolidated Statement of Operations as discontinued operations and on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as Assets and Liabilities held for sale. The purchase price for the DMS Sale Transaction is $18.75 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments, including a working capital adjustment.
On February 1, 2021, the Company completed the sale of its MD Office Solutions subsidiary to M.D.O.S.C.A Inc., a California based holding company (“MDOSCA”), in exchange for a secured promissory note in the original principal amount of $1.4 million and entry into multi-year service and support agreements between MDOSCA and Digirad Health, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements
On March 25, 2021, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company, upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee of the Board and after considering the recommendations of management, and discussing such recommendations with BDO USA, LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, concluded that our previously released financial statements for quarterly and annual periods after and including March 31, 2019 and any earnings releases or other communications relating to these periods should no longer be relied upon due to misstatements that are described in greater detail in Notes 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
