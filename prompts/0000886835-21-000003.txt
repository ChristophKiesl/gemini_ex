Recent Developments

Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code

On December 4, 2020, Superior Energy Services, Inc. (the Former Parent, which is now known as SESI Holdings, Inc.) and certain of its direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries (together with the Former Parent, the Affiliate Debtors) entered into an Amended and Restated Restructuring Support Agreement (the Amended RSA) that amended and restated in its entirety the Restructuring Support Agreement (the RSA), dated September 29, 2020, with certain holders of SESI, L.L.C.’s (SESI) outstanding (i) 7.125% senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the 7.125% Notes) and (ii) 7.750% senior unsecured notes due 2024 (the 7.750% Notes). The parties to the Amended RSA agreed to the principal terms of a proposed financial restructuring of the Affiliate Debtors, which was implemented through the Plan (as defined below).

On December 7, 2020, the Affiliate Debtors filed the Chapter 11 Cases under the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court, and, in connection therewith, the Affiliate Debtors filed with the Bankruptcy Court the proposed Joint Prepackaged Plan of Reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, the Plan). On January 19, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order, Docket No. 289, confirming and approving the Plan (the Confirmation Order). On February 2, 2021 (the Effective Date), the conditions to effectiveness of the Plan were satisfied or waived and we emerged from Chapter 11. 




In addition, pursuant to the Plan, among other things: 

Administrative expense claims, priority tax claims, other priority claims, and other secured claims will be or have been paid in full in the ordinary course (or receive such other treatment rendering such claims unimpaired);
General unsecured creditors for the Affiliate Debtors remained unimpaired and received payment in cash, in full, in the ordinary course; 
Each holder of a Former Parent guarantee received its pro rata share of a $125,000 parent recovery cash pool; 
Eligible holders of the claims arising as a result of holding either the 7.125% Notes or the 7.750% Notes against the Affiliate Debtors received their pro rata share of:
A payment equal to 2% of the principal amount of 7.125% Notes or 7.750% Notes held by all holders who did not opt of receiving a cash payout; or
solely to the extent that such a holder timely and validly elected to opt out of receiving the cash payout, (A) 100% of the Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding on the Effective Date, subject to dilution, and (B), to the extent such holder was an “accredited investor” or “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of the SEC’s rules, subscription rights to participate in an equity rights offering (the Equity Rights Offering); and
The Affiliate Debtors conducted the Equity Rights Offering through an offering of subscription rights for the purchase of Class A Common Stock on a pro rata basis, as described below. 

As a result of certain related internal restructurings, effective as of the Effective Date, the entity now known as Superior Energy Services, Inc. became the successor reporting company to the Former Parent pursuant to Rule 15d-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). 

The costs of our efforts to restructure our capital, prior to and during the Chapter 11 Cases, along with all other costs incurred in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, have been significant. During 2020, the Former Parent incurred $47.1 million of such costs prior to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases and $21.6 million during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases. 

On the Effective Date, pursuant to the terms of the Plan, we filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the Certificate of Incorporation) and a Certificate of Amendment of Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the Certificate of Amendment). 

Also, on the Effective Date, and pursuant to the terms of the Plan, we adopted the Amended and Restated Bylaws (the Bylaws). The descriptions of the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full texts of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, and Certificate of Amendment which are incorporated by reference herein.

Credit Facility
On the Effective Date, pursuant to the Plan, the Former Parent and SESI entered into a Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other lenders and letter of credit issuers named therein providing for the Credit Facility, all of which is available for issuing letters of credit. On the Effective Date, the Credit Facility replaced the Senior Secured Debtor-in-Possession Credit Facility (the DIP Credit Facility) and approximately $46.6 million of undrawn letters of credit outstanding under the former DIP Credit Facility were deemed outstanding under the Credit Facility. All accrued and unpaid fees and other amounts outstanding thereunder were paid in full as well. The Credit Facility will mature on December 9, 2024. The borrowing base under the Credit Facility is determined by reference to SESI’s and the subsidiary guarantors’ billed and unbilled eligible accounts receivable, eligible inventory, until the earlier of December 9, 2022 and the Former Parent and its wholly-owned subsidiaries’ unrestricted cash being less than $75 million, eligible premium rental drill pipe and, so long as there are no loans outstanding at such time, certain cash of SESI and the subsidiary guarantors, less reserves established by the administrative agent in its permitted discretion. 
Availability under the Credit Facility will be the lesser of (i) the commitments and (ii) the borrowing base. Subject to certain conditions, upon request and with the consent of the participating lenders, the total commitments under the Credit Facility may be increased to $170.0 million. SESI’s obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by the Former Parent and all of SESI’s material domestic subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of the Former Parent’s, SESI’s and the subsidiary guarantors’ assets, other than real property. 
Any borrowings under the Credit Facility will bear interest, at SESI’s option, at either an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 3.00% to 3.50% per annum, or an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.00% to 2.50% per annum, in each case on the basis of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio. In addition, SESI is required to pay (i) a letter of credit fee, (ii) to the issuing lender of each letter of credit, a fronting fee and (iii) commitment fees. 
The Credit Facility requires compliance with various covenants, including, but not limited to, limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness, permitted investments, liens on assets, making distributions, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, dispositions of assets and other provisions customary in similar types of agreements. The Credit Facility also requires compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 if (a) an event of default has occurred and is continuing or (b) availability under the Credit 

 

Facility is less than the greater of $20.0 million or 15% of the lesser of the aggregate commitments and the borrowing base. The covenants and other restrictions of the Credit Facility significantly restrict the ability to incur borrowings other than letters of credit.
The foregoing description of the Credit Facility is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Facility agreement evidencing it, which is incorporated herein by reference.
DDTL Commitment Letter
On the Effective Date, that certain Commitment Letter, dated as of September 29, 2020, with certain consenting noteholders terminated in accordance with its terms upon the effectiveness of the Credit Facility without the establishment of the delayed-draw term loan facility.
Stockholders Agreement
On the Effective Date, in order to implement the governance related provisions reflected in the Plan, the Stockholders Agreement (the Stockholders Agreement) was executed, to provide for certain governance matters. Other than obligations related to Confidential Information (as defined in the Stockholders Agreement), the rights and preferences of each stockholder under the Stockholders Agreement will terminate when such stockholder ceases to own any shares of Class A Common Stock. 
The foregoing description of the Stockholders Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the document, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Resignation of Executive Officers 
On March 22, 2021, the Company announced the resignation of David D. Dunlap, President and Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors, and Westervelt T. Ballard, Jr., Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Neither of the resignations resulted from any disagreement with the Company regarding any matter related to the Company’s operations, policies, or practices. Michael Y. McGovern, the Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors, was appointed as Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors and assumed the functions of the Company's principal executive officer, and James W. Spexarth, the Company’s Chief Accounting Officer, has been appointed interim Chief Financial Officer.

Pursuant to the Plan, as of the Effective Date, the following directors ceased to serve on the Former Parent’s board of directors: Terence E. Hall, Peter D. Kinnear, Janiece M. Longoria, Michael M. McShane, James M. Funk and W. Matt Ralls. All officers immediately prior to the Effective Date were retained in their existing positions upon the Effective Date, subject to the terms of the Plan.

Joseph Citarrella 
Daniel E. Flores 
Michael Y. McGovern 
Julie J. Robertson

Senior Notes 
As part of the transactions undertaken pursuant to the Plan, the record holders of certain of the 7.125% Notes and the 7.750% Notes contributed all of their allowed claims described in the Plan in exchange for either (i) a cash payout to be entirely funded by an equity rights offering in connection with the Plan discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Equity Rights Offering), or (ii) shares of the Class A Common Stock. On the Effective Date, all outstanding obligations under the 7.125% Notes and the 7.750% Notes, were cancelled, and the applicable agreements governing such obligations were terminated. Furthermore, all existing shares of common stock of the Former Parent were cancelled pursuant to the Plan, and we are in the process of issuing shares of Class A Common Stock to such noteholders, subject to dilution on account of the Class B Common Stock to be issued to our management under a management equity incentive plan. The Class A Common Stock issued to such holders is exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), pursuant to Section 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code (which generally exempts from such registration requirements the issuance of securities under a plan of reorganization).

Prior to the Effective Date, the Equity Rights Offering was completed in accordance with the Plan, which resulted in the issuance of 735,189 shares of Class A Common Stock. The Class A Common Stock issued in the Equity Rights Offering was exempt from registration under the Securities Act pursuant to section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder.



COVID-19 Pandemic and Market Conditions

Our operations continue to be disrupted due to the circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. The significant business disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted customers, vendors and suppliers in all geographical areas where we operate. The closure of non-essential business facilities and restrictions on travel put in place by governments around the world have significantly reduced economic activity. Also, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. For example, the continued spread of COVID-19 has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which increases the cost of capital and adversely impacts access to capital. Additionally, recognized health risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have altered the policies of companies operating around the world, resulting in these companies instituting safety programs similar to what both domestic and international governmental agencies have implemented, including stay at home orders, social distancing mandates, and other community oriented health objectives. We are complying with all such ordinances in our operations across the globe. Management believes it has proactively addressed many of the known operational impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic to the extent possible and will strive to continue to do so, but there can be no guarantee the measures will be fully effective.

Furthermore, the oil and gas industry experienced unprecedented price disruptions during 2020, which are continuing in 2021, due in part to significantly decreased demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as activity declined in the face of depressed crude oil pricing. The U.S. oil and gas rig count fell by more than 50% in the second half of 2020. The number of oil and gas rigs outside of the U.S. and Canada fell by more than 25% in the second half of 2020 to an average of 697 rigs from 954 rigs in the first half of 2020. These market conditions have significantly impacted our business, with 2020 revenue decreasing to $851.3 million, as compared to $1,425.4 million in 2019, or 40%. As customers continue to revise their capital budgets in order to adjust spending levels in response to lower commodity prices, we have experienced significant pricing pressure for our products and services. 

Low oil prices and industry volatility are likely to continue through the near and long-term. The recent widespread escalation of COVID-19 cases remains a significant factor impacting oil demand. Vaccination campaigns are underway; however, several regions, including areas of the United States, have been and continue to deal with a rebound in the pandemic resulting in tighter mobility constraints and less travel. There is also concern about whether vaccines will be effective against different strains of the virus that have developed and may develop in the future.

As the global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, management expects it to continue to materially and adversely affect our revenue, financial condition, profitability, and cash flow for an indeterminate period of time. We will continue to take certain actions to address challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and deliver on our commitment to emerge stronger from this crisis.

New York Stock Exchange Delisting

On September 17, 2020, the Former Parent was notified by the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE) that it was no longer in compliance with the NYSE continued listing standards. Trading of the Former Parent’s common stock on the NYSE was suspended effective as of approximately 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time on September 17, 2020. The Former Parent’s common stock was subsequently delisted from trading on the NYSE and removed from registration under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act. 

On September 18, 2020, the Former Parent’s common stock commenced trading on the OTCQX marketplace. In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, the Former Parent’s common stock was removed from the OTCQX marketplace on December 10, 2020 and commenced trading on the OTC Pink Sheets during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases. In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, the Former Parent’s common stock was canceled. The shares of our Class A Common Stock are not listed on a national securities exchange. 

Products and Services

We offer a wide variety of specialized oilfield services and equipment generally categorized by their typical use during the economic life of a well. A description of the products and services offered by each of our four segments is as follows:

Drilling Products and Services – Includes downhole drilling tools and surface rentals.
Downhole drilling tools – Includes rentals of tubulars, such as primary drill pipe strings, landing strings, completion tubulars and associated accessories, and manufacturing and rentals of bottom hole tools, including stabilizers, non-magnetic drill collars and hole openers.
Surface rentals – Includes rentals of temporary onshore and offshore accommodation modules and accessories.
Onshore Completion and Workover Services – Includes fluid management and workover services.
Fluid management – Includes services used to obtain, move, store and dispose of fluids that are involved in the exploration, development and production of oil and gas, including mobile piping systems, specialized trucks, fracturing tanks and other assets that transport, heat, pump and dispose of fluids.





Workover services – Includes a variety of well completion, workover and maintenance services, including installations, completions, sidetracking of wells and support for perforating operations.
Production Services – Includes intervention services.
Intervention services – Includes services to enhance, maintain and extend oil and gas production during the life of the well, including coiled tubing, cased hole and mechanical wireline, hydraulic workover and snubbing, pressure control services, production testing and optimization.
Technical Solutions – Includes products and services that generally address customer-specific needs with their applications, which typically require specialized engineering, manufacturing or project planning expertise. Most operations requiring our technical solutions are generally in offshore environments during the completion, production and decommissioning phase of an oil and gas well. These products and services primarily include completion tools and services and well control services. 
Completion tools and services – Provides products and services used during the completion phase of an offshore well to control sand and maximize oil and gas production, including sand control systems, well screens and filters, and surface-controlled sub surface safety valves.

Well control services – Mitigates and resolves well control and pressure control problems through firefighting, consulting, engineering and well control training.

The Technical Solutions segment also includes revenues from oil and gas production related to our 51% ownership interest in our sole federal offshore oil and gas property (which we refer to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the oil and gas property) and related assets. 

Customers

Our customers are the major and independent oil and gas companies that are active in the geographic areas in which we operate. There were no customers that exceeded 10% of our total revenues in 2020, 2019 or 2018. A reduction in sales to any of our existing large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.
Competition 

We provide products and services worldwide in highly competitive markets, with competitors comprised of both small and large companies. Our revenues and earnings can be affected by several factors, including changes in competition, fluctuations in drilling and completion activity, perceptions of future prices of oil and gas, government regulation, disruptions caused by weather, pandemics and general economic conditions. We believe that the principal competitive factors are price, performance, product and service quality, safety, response time and breadth of products and services.
Potential Liabilities and Insurance 

Our operations involve a high degree of operational risk and expose us to significant liabilities. An accident involving our services or equipment, or the failure of a product sold by us, could result in personal injury, loss of life, and damage to property, equipment or the environment. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence, such as fire, explosion, well blowout or vessel loss, may result in substantial claims for damages. 

As is customary in our industry, our contracts generally provide that we will indemnify and hold harmless our customers from any claims arising from personal injury or death of our employees, damage to or loss of our equipment, and pollution emanating from our equipment and services. Similarly, our customers generally agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims arising from personal injury or death of their employees, damage to or loss of their equipment or property, and pollution caused from their equipment or the well reservoir (including uncontained oil flow from a reservoir). Nonetheless, our indemnification arrangements may not protect us in every case.

We maintain a liability insurance program that covers against certain operating hazards, including product liability, property damage and personal injury claims, as well as certain limited environmental pollution claims for damage to a third party or its property arising out of contact with pollution for which we are liable, but well control costs are not covered by this program.  These policies include primary and excess umbrella liability policies with limits of $200 million per occurrence, including sudden and accidental pollution incidents. All of the insurance policies we purchase contain specific terms, conditions, limitations and exclusions and are subject to either deductibles or self-insured retention amounts for which we are responsible.  There can be no assurance that the nature and amount of insurance we maintain will be sufficient to fully protect us against all liabilities related to our business.




Government Regulation 

Our business is significantly affected by federal, state and local laws and other regulations. These laws and regulations relate to, among other things:

worker safety standards;
the protection of the environment;
the handling and transportation of hazardous materials; and
the mobilization of our equipment to, and operations conducted at, our work sites.

Numerous permits are required for the conduct of our business and operation of our various facilities and equipment, including our underground injection wells, trucks and other heavy equipment. These permits can be revoked, modified or renewed by issuing authorities based on factors both within and outside our control.

We cannot predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations or how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings in the future. We also cannot predict whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted, including changes in regulatory oversight, increase of federal, state or local taxes, increase of inspection costs, or the effect such changes may have on us, our businesses or our financial condition.

Environmental Matters

Our operations, and those of our customers, are subject to extensive laws, regulations and treaties relating to air and water quality, generation, storage and handling of hazardous materials, and emission and discharge of materials into the environment. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all regulations affecting our business. Historically, our expenditures in furtherance of our compliance with these laws, regulations and treaties have not been material, and we do not expect the cost of compliance to be material in the future.
Raw Materials

We purchase various raw materials and component parts in connection with delivering our products and services. These materials are generally, but not always, available from multiple sources and may be subject to price volatility. While we generally do not experience significant long-term shortages of these materials, we have from time to time experienced temporary shortages of particular raw materials. We are always seeking ways to ensure the availability of resources, as well as manage costs of raw materials. 
Seasonality

Seasonal weather and severe weather conditions can temporarily impair our operations and reduce demand for our products and services. Examples of seasonal events that negatively affect our operations include high seas associated with cold fronts during the winter months and hurricanes during the summer months in the Gulf of Mexico, and severe cold during winter months in the U.S. land market area. 
Employees 

At December 31, 2020, we had approximately 3,300 employees. Approximately 12% of our employees are subject to union contracts, all of which are in international locations. We believe that we have good relationships with our employees. 
Facilities

Our principal executive offices are located at 1001 Louisiana Street, Suite 2900, Houston, Texas, 77002. We own or lease a large number of facilities in the various areas in which we operate throughout the world.
Intellectual Property 

We seek patent and trademark protections throughout the world for our technology when we deem it prudent, and we aggressively pursue protection of these rights. We believe our patents and trademarks are adequate for the conduct of our business, and that no single patent or trademark is critical to our business. In addition, we rely to a great extent on the technical expertise and know-how of our personnel to maintain our competitive position.
Other Information

We have our principal executive offices at 1001 Louisiana Street, Suite 2900, Houston, Texas 77002. Our telephone number is (713) 654-2200. We also have a website at http://www.superiorenergy.com.
