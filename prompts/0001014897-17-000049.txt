ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Gotham Capital Holdings, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated in the State of New Jersey on October 1, 2003 under the name of Creative Beauty Supply of New Jersey Corporation and subsequently changed its name to Gotham Capital Holdings, Inc. on May 18, 2015.

Corporate Operations
 On January 1, 2004, the Company commenced operations in the beauty supply industry at both the wholesale and retail levels. On November 30, 2007, the Companys Board of Directors approved a plan to dispose of its wholesale and retail beauty supply business. As of January 1, 2009, the Company has had no operations and is a shell company. 

The Companys business plan is to attempt to identify and negotiate with a business target for the merger of that entity with and into the Company. In certain instances, a target company may wish to become a subsidiary of the Company or may wish to contribute or sell assets to the Company rather than to merge. No assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in identifying or negotiating with any target company. The Company seeks to provide a method for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting or public company whose securities are qualified for trading in the United States secondary markets.

A business combination with a target company normally will involve the transfer to the target company of the majority of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company, and the substitution by the target company of its own management and board of directors. No assurances can be given that the Company will be able to enter into a business combination, or, if the Company does enter into such a business combination, no assurances can be given as to the terms of a business combination, or as to the nature of the target company.

The current and proposed business activities described herein classify the Company as a blank check company. The Securities and Exchange Commission and many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of blank check companies. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in the Companys securities until such time as the Company has successfully implemented its business plan described herein.

In 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted resolutions to amend their Articles of Incorporation to increase the authorized shares to 200,000,000, to amend Articles of Incorporation to change the Companys name to Gotham Capital Holdings, Inc., and to authorize a 1-for-2 reverse split of all outstanding common shares. The corporation actions became effective as of May 18, 2015. 

On April 1, 2015, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Gotham Capital, Inc. and certain Gotham Capital, Inc. shareholders which would have resulted in a change of control of the Company upon execution of the agreement. On July 22, 2016, both parties signed a mutual release that agreed to settle disputes and differences that have arisen between the two parties and cancelled the SPA. The Company has received a reimbursement of $20,000 for professional fees related to the agreement.

Further to our investigation of business opportunities, on March 16, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted resolutions to change the Companys name to IIOT-OXYS, Inc., to authorize a change of domicile from New Jersey to Nevada, to authorize a 2017 Stock Awards Plan, and to approve the Securities Exchange Agreement between the Company and OXYS Corporation (OXYS), a Nevada Corporation. The actions have been approved by stockholders representing 84.2% of the Company.

 Our Board of Directors and Majority Shareholders has approved a securities exchange agreement with the shareholders of OXYS to acquire 100% of the issued voting shares of OXYS in exchange for 34,687,244 of the Companys common shares. The securities and exchange agreement has not been executed as of the date of this filing. Upon execution of the securities and exchange agreement, the acquisition will result in a change of control of the Company. The 34,687,244 common shares to be issued consist wholly of securities exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933. The share consideration to be paid by the Company to the OXYS shareholders will represent approximately 90% of our issued voting equity on a fully diluted basis following closing. The corporate actions will not be effective until twenty days after the Definitive Information Statement filing date with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

OXYS is in the business of providing a combination of hardware and software products combined with services at the Edge of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT). The software services on top of that platform will enable local data processing, filtering, aggregation etc. to ensure that only that data worth keeping goes to higher levels. The OXYS Edge Device will also ensure that a local SECRET KEY known only to the OXYS Edge Device is safely stored and can never be hacked at the cloud level. In this way customer data cannot be mined by companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon etc. to surreptitiously create additional value on the backs of clients. OXYS will return control of data to the customer and will realize some of the value stream that would otherwise have gone to the cloud. 

  The business model of OXYS consists of the following aspects:
 1.
 EdgeTelligence: Provide a unique OXYS Edge Computing Device to serve as the local hardware platform for local analytics
 2.
 EdgeRune: Provide software to enable these local analytics
 3.
 EdgeMap: Provide data science and data analytics consulting services

  Therefore, there will be three associated revenue streams: hardware sales, software sales and licensing, and consulting services. The OXYS system including the SECRET KEY is expected to be fully operative in less than six months and ready to be incorporated into hundreds of thousands of industrial devices, following successful funding.

  OXYS is additionally working with universities, other companies, and other entrepreneurs in the area to implement best in class security from both a hardware and software perspective. This provides additional revenue sources and access to customers in the IIoT and even the internetworking of physical devices known as the Internet of Things.

Also at closing of the Securities Exchange Agreement, Carmine Catizone, a current officer and director and Pasquale Catizone, a majority shareholder will return an aggregate of 1,500,000 common shares to the Company for cancellation such that neither Carmine or Pasquale Catizone shall retain 5% or more of our voting securities. Pasquale Catizone has entered into a consulting

agreement with OXYS to provide consulting services during the transition. At closing of the Securities and Exchange Agreement, Carmine Catizone and Daniel Generelli will resign as officers and directors.
