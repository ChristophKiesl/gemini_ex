Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of a portfolio of product candidates to treat patients suffering from central nervous system, or CNS, diseases. Leveraging our scientific insights and clinical experience, we have acquired or in-licensed four development-stage proprietary compounds that we believe have innovative mechanisms of action and therapeutic profiles that may potentially address the unmet needs of patients with these diseases. 
 Our product portfolio and potential indications include:  MIN-101 for the treatment of schizophrenia; MIN-202 (also known as JNJ-42847922), which we are co-developing with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, or Janssen, for the treatment of insomnia disorder and  major depressive disorder, or MDD; MIN-117 for the treatment of MDD; and MIN-301 for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. We believe our product candidates have significant potential to improve the lives of a large number of affected patients and their families who are currently not well-served by available therapies.  According to Datamonitor, an independent market research firm, in 2016 approximately 3.3 million people suffered from schizophrenia, 28.9 million suffered from MDD and 1.9 million suffered from Parkinson’s disease in the United States, Japan and the five major European Union markets of France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom.  Insomnia is believed to affect approximately 30 to 35 percent of the global population as estimated by American Academy of Sleep Medicine

. 
 Our Strategy 
 Our strategy is to develop and commercialize first-in-class products that address critical unmet medical needs in the CNS therapeutic area. We are pursuing this strategy based on the following principles: selection of products with novel mechanisms of action; attention to patient safety and compliance; scientific rigor applied to patient selection and clinical trial conduct; incorporation of patient and caregiver insights to drive clinical advancements; and integrity. Minerva management, as well as the clinical research organizations conducting our trials, have significant experience with study centers and investigators in the countries where we have conducted and are conducting our trials.  As a result, we have access to well characterized and validated patient populations and to highly trained physicians with experience in conducting CNS-related trials.   With the experience and knowledge base of our clinicians and physicians, we have generated substantive data from randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trials that support the clinical advancement of these products in defined patient populations and in multiple regulatory jurisdictions, including the United States and Europe.  In summary, key elements of our strategy are:

• | Identify, acquire and develop differentiated products based on biological and clinical insights related to the unmet needs of patients;

Our History 
 In November 2013, Cyrenaic Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Cyrenaic, and Sonkei Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Sonkei, merged, and the combined company was renamed Minerva Neurosciences, Inc. Cyrenaic had been incorporated in 2007 and had exclusively licensed MIN-101 from Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, or MTPC. Sonkei had been incorporated in 2008 and had exclusively licensed MIN-117 from MTPC. We executed the merger as we saw an opportunity to better serve an underserved patient population through combining a portfolio of promising product candidates targeting CNS diseases. As a result of the merger, we have the rights to develop and commercialize MIN-101 and MIN-117 globally, excluding most of Asia. 
 We further expanded our product candidate portfolio in February 2014 by acquiring the shares of Mind-NRG Sarl, or Mind-NRG, which had exclusive rights to develop and commercialize MIN-301. In addition, in February 2014 we entered into a co-development and license agreement with Janssen, one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson. Pursuant to this agreement we are co-developing MIN-202 and have the right to commercialize this compound in the European Union, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Iceland and Norway, or the Minerva Territory, subject to royalty payments to Janssen, with Janssen having commercialization rights outside of the Minerva Territory, subject to royalty payments to us.  Effective January 28, 2016 Mind-NRG converted under Swiss law from an S.A. (public limited liability company) to an S.A.R.L. (company with limited liability). 
 We have not received regulatory approvals to commercialize any of our product candidates, and we have not generated any revenue from the sales or license of our product candidates. We have incurred significant operating losses since inception. We expect to incur net losses and negative cash flow from operating activities for the foreseeable future in connection with the clinical development and the potential regulatory approval, infrastructure development and commercialization of our product candidates.

Our Pipeline 
 

MIN-101
 Introduction
 MIN-101 is a compound that has been shown to block serotonin receptors and sigma receptors, two receptors in the brain that are involved in the regulation of mood, cognition, sleep and anxiety. We are developing MIN-101 to treat patients with schizophrenia. MIN-101 has been designed to block a specific subtype of serotonin receptor called 5-HT2A. When 5-HT2A is blocked, certain symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations, delusions, agitation and thought and movement disorders, as well as the side effects associated with antipsychotic treatments, can be minimized. Additionally, blocking 5-HT2A promotes slow wave sleep, a sleep stage often disrupted in patients with schizophrenia. MIN-101 has also been designed to block a specific subtype of sigma receptor called sigma2, which is involved in movement control, psychotic symptom control and learning and memory. Blocking sigma2 also increases calcium levels in neurons in the brain, which can improve memory.  Recent literature has also indicated that a sub-type of progesterone protein complex might also be a putative binding site for sigma2 receptors and might explain the effects on cognition of MIN-101.
 We believe the scientifically supported and innovative mechanisms of action of MIN-101 may potentially address the unmet needs of schizophrenic patients which include negative symptoms and cognitive impairment, as well as the side effects of existing therapies. We plan to seek approval of MIN-101 initially as a first line therapy to treat negative symptoms in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, and we also may study its use in combination with approved atypical antipsychotic agents.  We believe that MIN-101, if approved, could treat the majority of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. 
 We have exclusively licensed MIN-101 and a number of back-up compounds from MTPC. MTPC has retained commercialization rights to MIN-101 in most of Asia.

Clinical Development
Phase IIb Trial
 In May 2016, we announced top line results from a prospective Phase IIb, 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel clinical trial evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of MIN-101 as monotherapy in patients with negative symptoms of schizophrenia using the pentagonal structure model, or PSM, of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, or PANSS.  These negative symptoms, for which no approved treatment is currently available, affect the majority of schizophrenic patients and can persist over their lifetimes. A total of 244 patients were randomized in equal groups to receive daily doses of MIN-101 32 mg, MIN-101 64 mg or placebo at 32 clinical sites in Russia and five European countries. To participate in the trial, patients were required to have stable positive and negative symptoms for three months prior to entry, a PANSS negative sub-score greater than or equal to 20, and scores < 4 on the following PANSS items: excitement, hyperactivity, hostility, suspiciousness, uncooperativeness and poor impulse control.  All three cohorts were balanced with respect to demographic and baseline disease characteristics.
 The study achieved its primary endpoint, as we observed a statistically significant benefit of MIN-101 over placebo in improving negative symptoms as measured by the PSM of PANSS. The effect was observed for both doses tested: 32 milligrams (mg): p ≤ 0.024 with an effect size of 0.45, and 64 mg: p ≤ 0.004 with effect size of 0.57.
 We also observed a statistically significant benefit of MIN-101 over placebo on the PANSS three factors negative symptoms subscale for both doses tested: 32 mg: p ≤ 0.006, with an effect size of 0.54, and 64 mg: p ≤ 0.001 with an effect size of 0.70. 
 Furthermore, the statistically significant benefit of MIN-101 over placebo was observed on the PANSS total score (not significant for the 32 mg dose; p ≤ 0.003 for the 64 mg dose), with effect sizes of 0.34 and 0.57, respectively.
 The consistency and robustness of the effect was also supported by the observed statistically significant benefit of MIN-101 over placebo in multiple secondary endpoints as measured by the following: the PANSS general psychopathology subscale, Brief Negative Symptoms Scale total score, Clinical Global Impression of Severity, Clinical Global Impression of Improvement, Personal and Social Performance total score and Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) total score. Positive symptoms were observed to remain stable, and the absence of extra-pyramidal symptoms (EPS) throughout the three month trial is consistent with the hypothesis that MIN-101 has a direct and specific effect on negative symptoms rather than an indirect effect mediated by improvements of positive symptoms.
 Discontinuation criteria based on QTcF prolongation were incorporated in the protocol. Two patients out of 162 who received MIN-101 were discontinued based upon these criteria; both of these patients received the higher dose (64 mg).
 Patients who completed the 12-week double-blind core phase of this study were provided the opportunity to enter into a 24-week, open-label extension phase. The extension phase was completed during the third quarter of 2016, and we announced data from the extension phase in October 2016. Data generated during the extension period were intended to provide longer term supportive evidence of efficacy and to complement the statistically significant results obtained during the core phase. 
 During the extension phase, all patients received either 32 mg or 64 mg of MIN-101.  Patients who received placebo in the core phase were randomized to one of these two doses at the beginning of the extension phase.  One hundred forty-two patients from the treatment and placebo groups in the core phase entered the extension phase, with 88 patients completing the extension. Seventy patients received 32 mg and 72 patients received 64 mg during the extension.  
 Negative symptoms, assessed based on the PANSS PSM, were observed to continue to improve during the extension phase, as shown by a reduction from the study start for the 32 and 64 mg-treated groups of 5.5 points and 4.9 points, respectively, and by a reduction of 5.4 points and 5.3 points, respectively, in the PANSS three factors negative symptoms subscale.
 Positive symptoms were observed to remain stable throughout the study, as measured by PANSS positive symptom scores. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that MIN-101 has a direct and specific effect on negative symptoms.   General psychopathology was observed to improve during the extension phase for the 32 and 64 mg groups, as shown by reductions in the PANSS general psychopathology subscale score.  
 MIN-101 was generally reported to be well tolerated through the entire 36-week period. Based on previous non-clinical and clinical experience, QTcF, a measure of cardiac function, was closely monitored throughout the study, and discontinuation criteria based on QTcF prolongation were incorporated in the protocol. Two patients out of 162 who received MIN-101 in the core phase were discontinued based upon these criteria; both of these patients received the higher dose (64 mg). In the extension phase no additional patients were discontinued.  In the extension phase, we also observed that MIN-101 at the doses tested did not have an effect on EPS, prolactin or weight gain.

Additional data analyses from the Phase IIb trial were presented at the 55th Annual Meeting of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology, or ACNP in December 2016. These analyses concluded that MIN-101 has a direct effect on negative symptoms (rather than an indirect or pseudo effect secondary to improvements in other symptoms) as supported by the stability observed in positive symptoms, the absence of EPS and the persistence of this direct effect even after controlling for improvements in depressive symptoms.  Researchers noted that since phenomena similar to negative symptoms are manifest in many psychiatric disorders and in brain degenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, future trials with MIN-101 could be designed to explore its potential benefit in these patient populations.
 In post-hoc analysis presented at ACNP, improvement in negative symptoms was shown to be greatest among younger patients, especially in the cohort of patients under 33 years of age.  This finding supports the potential therapeutic intervention with MIN-101 in younger patients with schizophrenia who are beginning to manifest these symptoms.  It is also consistent with research showing that chronic pharmacotherapeutic intervention in schizophrenia, which includes atypical antipsychotics to treat acute positive symptoms, becomes less effective as patients age and suffer long-term consequences of the disease and side effects of current treatment options.
 Additional results presented at ACNP suggest a benefit of treatment with MIN-101 32 mg in improving cognitive function in schizophrenia patients with predominant negative symptoms.  Cognitive function was evaluated using the BACS scale, and data analyses demonstrated statistically significant differences between patients treated with MIN-101 at the 32 mg dose and those who received placebo.  Cognitive impairment, a core feature of schizophrenia, affects up to 75% of patients and is believed to be a good predictor of functional outcome.  
 Phase IIa Trial
 In 2009 we completed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase IIa trial of MIN-101 as monotherapy in subjects suffering from schizophrenia. Enrolled subjects had previously suffered from an acute episode requiring hospitalization.  This was a double-blind, placebo controlled study with a three month treatment period in which 96 subjects were randomized and 30 completed the study protocol. Patients suffered from positive, negative and cognitive symptoms and had ceased to respond well to previously prescribed medication. Subjects received either placebo or MIN-101, including doses and at a dosing schedule that may differ from the final formulated dose.
 The primary endpoint of the study was the efficacy of MIN-101 versus placebo, as measured by PANSS total and sub-scores after one month of treatment. The PANSS is used to measure psychopathology in patients suffering from schizophrenia and can be split into either three factors (positive, negative and general psychopathology) or in five factors (positive, negative, activation, dysphoric mood and autistic thoughts).  Secondary and exploratory endpoints included the efficacy of MIN-101 versus placebo through the PANSS total and sub scores after three months of treatment, as well as cognition, mood, anxiety and sleep using various psychological scales at various treatment time points.
 In the Phase IIa trial, subjects treated with MIN-101 showed ongoing improvements in negative symptoms, as compared to baseline, throughout the duration of the trial. After one month, improvements on the PANSS negative symptoms scale were observed. Because this Phase IIa trial was not powered to show results with statistical significance, the study’s primary endpoint was not met. After three months of treatment, the MIN-101 group showed improvements in negative symptoms as compared to placebo.
 Recent additional analysis of results from this Phase IIa trial presented at ACNP showed that treatment with MIN-101 was associated with significantly improved sleep induction and normalized slow wave sleep ultradian distribution during the night, which are two key sleep parameters that are disturbed in schizophrenia.  Such disturbances of sleep architecture and continuity may be associated with memory consolidation, which is impaired in schizophrenia.  These effects on sleep para


meters may help to improve the overall symptomatology observed in patients suffering from schizophrenia and treated with MIN-101.
 Subjects participating in this clinical trial receiving MIN-101 or placebo experienced adverse events, including, but not limited to gastrointestinal, nervous system, psychiatric, and cardiac events, with two subjects with increased heart rate and one subject with decreased heart rate that were deemed to be possibly related to MIN-101 by investigators. Generally, with the exception of cardiac events, which occurred in the MIN-101 subjects alone, similar adverse events were seen in the placebo group tested in this study, although at different rates. The safety results of the Phase IIa study supported Phase I results observed in hea
lthy volunteers. 
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, accepted our Investigational New Drug (IND) application for MIN-101 in December 2015. Acceptance of the IND is a requirement for the initiation of clinical testing in the United States.  Following the Phase IIb trial, we are conducting a number of supportive studies with MIN-101 that include formulation and metabolism studies designed to reduce further the potential for QTcF prolongation and to explore dose ranges for patients who metabolize this compound differently.  In the first quarter of 2017, we requested a meeting with the FDA to review the complete package of clinical and pre-clinical data generated with MIN-101 and to discuss the design of pivotal Phase III clinical trials.  This “end of Phase II” meeting has been 
 7


scheduled to take place early in the second quarter of 2017. Thereafter, we plan to request a scientific advisory meeting with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA.  We expect to initiate Phase III testing of MIN-101 in patients with negative symptoms of schizophrenia in both the U.S. and Europe in the second half of 2017.
 MIN-117
 Introduction
 MIN-117 is a compound we are developing to treat patients suffering from MDD, the most prominent subtype of depression.  Patients suffering from MDD experience feelings of sadness, loss, anger or frustration that interfere with their ability to carry out and enjoy once-pleasurable activities. While suicide is the leading cause of death in those with MDD, other factors, such as changes in immune function and susceptibility to disease, can also lead to early mortality.
 We believe MIN-117 has the potential to address limitations of existing therapies, such as slow onset of action and poor safety and tolerability, without many of the typical side effects associated with currently approved therapies.  The pharmacological effects of MIN-117 are related to serotonin and dopamine, two neurotransmitters in the brain. MIN-117 is meant to block a specific subtype of serotonin receptor called 5-HT1A. When 5-HT1A is blocked, anxiety and mood can be regulated. In addition, MIN-117 is meant to prevent the reuptake of serotonin and dopamine, which increases the amount of serotonin and dopamine in the brain, which is tied to an improvement in mood in individuals suffering from MDD. MIN-117 is also meant to modulate the levels of Alpha-1a and 1b, which further modulates serotonin and dopamine.
 Based upon clinical and pre-clinical studies completed to date, we believe MIN-117 may demonstrate a safety profile comparable to placebo without many of the typical side effects of current MDD treatments, including cognitive impairment, sexual dysfunction, sleep disorders and weight gain. As part of our license agreement with MTPC, we may develop, sell, and import products related to the MIN-117 compound globally, excluding most of Asia. 
 Clinical Development
 Phase IIa Trial
 In May 2016, we announced top line results from a Phase IIa clinical trial in MDD with MIN-117. Data from this trial were subsequently presented at the ACNP Annual Meeting in December 2016.  This study was a four-arm, parallel-group, randomized double-blind, placebo- and positive-control trial which tested two daily administered doses of MIN-117: 0.5 mg and 2.5 mg. The study included 84 patients (21 per arm) with moderate to severe MDD in four European countries. The goals of the trial were to test efficacy, safety and tolerability of MIN-117 over six weeks of treatment. The antidepressant paroxetine was used as an active control and confirmed assay sensitivity. Change on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, or MADRS, was used as the main outcome measurement. As established prospectively in the statistical analysis plan, this trial was designed for signal detection and effect size estimation.  As such, the study was not powered to demonstrate statistically significant differences between MIN-117 and placebo.
 We observed the dose-dependent benefit of MIN-117 over placebo as measured by change in the MADRS.  We observed that MIN-117 at the 0.5 mg daily dose had an effect size, as compared to the placebo group, of 0.24 while the 2.5 mg daily dose had an effect size of 0.34.  This magnitude of effect size is similar to those observed with currently marketed antidepressants.  Improvement in MADRS with MIN-117 against placebo was observed at two weeks. Furthermore, data also showed that 24 % of the patients treated with 2.5 mg of MIN-117 achieved remission as prospectively defined.
 Both doses of MIN-117 were reported to be well tolerated, and the incidence and types of side effects did not differ significantly between the MIN-117 group and the placebo group.  No unexpected adverse events were reported. Treatment with MIN-117 was not associated with cognitive impairment, sexual dysfunction, suicidal ideation or weight gain.
 Pharmacodynamic measurements based on sleep recordings showed that MIN-117 preserved sleep continuity and architecture and therefore is not expected to have detrimental effects on rapid eye movement sleep distribution and duration.
 In September 2016, we announced that the FDA has accepted our IND for MIN-117, allowing us to begin clinical trials with this compound in the United States, building upon the results from the Phase IIa trial in Europe.  Planning is underway for these trials, w




hich are expected to begin in late 2017.

MIN-202
 Introduction
 MIN-202 is an innovative selective orexin 2 receptor antagonist we are co-developing with Janssen for the treatment of insomnia and as adjunctive therapy for major depressive disorder, or MDD. Insomnia is the repeated difficulty with sleep initiation, maintenance or quality that occurs despite adequate time and opportunity for sleep, resulting in daytime impairment. Insomnia can be the primary condition for patients or a secondary symptom of, and contributor to, another medical or psychiatric condition, such as MDD or schizophrenia. 
 In the brain, the orexin system is involved in the control of several key functions, including metabolism and wakefulness. MIN-202 seeks to inhibit the activity of the neurons that promote wakefulness by selectively blocking the orexin 2 receptor. Rather than making an individual sleepier, blocking the orexin 2 receptor reduces the level of the neurotransmitters that signal the brain to maintain vigilance and wakefulness, which can be helpful for patients with insomnia. Janssen completed a Phase I single ascending dose study of MIN-202 in 2011 that suggested a relationship which supports a rapid induction and promotion of sleepiness.
 We are co-developing MIN-202 with Janssen and own the exclusive rights to develop and commercializ
e the compound in the Minerva Territory subject to royalty payments to Janssen and we have the right to receive royalties on any sales outside the Minerva Territory. 
 Clinical Development
 Phase IIa Trial  
 In January 2016, we announced top line results from a Phase IIa clinical trial of MIN-202 for the treatment of insomnia disorder. The trial was a randomized, two way, cross-over, placebo-controlled double-blind study to evaluate the effect of MIN-202 on sleep and daytime functioning in 28 patients with insomnia disorder without psychiatric co-morbidity. Patients were given 40 mg of MIN-202 or placebo in a cross-over design for treatment periods of five days, separated by a washout period. The trial was conducted at clinical sites in the United States and Europe.  Patients treated with MIN-202 in this trial were observed to have statistically significant improvements in key sleep parameters, compared to patients treated with placebo.  These parameters include sleep efficiency, or SE, as measured by objective polysomnography, the primary endpoint of the trial, for which a positive efficacy signal was detected for 40 milligrams MIN-202 versus placebo (p<0.001).  
 Additional significant positive efficacy signals were observed for key secondary parameters in this trial, including latency to persistent sleep, or LPS, wake after sleep onset, or WASO, and total sleep time, or TST.  Compared to placebo, MIN-202 was observed to significantly improve polysomnography parameters (p<0.001) on Days 1 and 5. On Day 5, LPS and WASO were observed to be reduced by 23.2 and 11 minutes, respectively, and TST and SE increased by 39 minutes and 8.12 percent, respectively. Objective and subjective evaluations were significantly correlated.  Subjectively estimated TST, LPS, and WASO were also observed to be improved versus placebo by 43.1, -38.8, and -14.8 minutes, respectively. No serious adverse events were observed in this trial, and preliminary data indicate that MIN-202 was well tolerated by patients. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events associated with exposure to MIN-202 during the double-blind phase of the study were somnolence and abnormal dreams.
 Phase Ib Trial
 In March 2016, we announced top line results from the Phase Ib clinical trial in MDD with MIN-202 conducted in Europe.  Data from this trial were subsequently presented at the ACNP Annual Meeting in December 2016.  The Phase Ib trial was a randomized, double-blind, parallel group study including 20 mg of MIN-202 administered in the evening, a positive control, 25 mg of diphenhydramine, and placebo, to evaluate treatment with MIN-202 in 48 subjects ages 18 to 65 years with a diagnosis of MDD who could be treated with marketed antidepressants.  MIN-202 was observed to be well tolerated by study participants over a one-month treatment duration, with no serious adverse events. Consistently greater improvements in depressive symptomatology were observed in patients randomized to receive MIN-202 compared to those randomized to receive placebo or diphenhydramine, as measured by clinician administered rating scales, including the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. These findings support the potential of MIN-202 to have a direct effect on mood independent from its effect on sleep.  Core symptoms of depression (as measured by the HAM-D 6) were observed to be significantly improved in the MIN-202 arm when compared with PLA.  
Phase I Trial in Japan 
 In February 2016, we announced top line data from a Phase I clinical trial with MIN-202 conducted in Japan. It was observed that single dose morning administration of MIN-202 was well tolerated at all three dose levels tested, 5 mg, 20 mg and 40 mg.  The 
 9


observed plasma pharmacokinetic features were comparable to those observed in previous trials carried out in healthy non-Asian study participants.  No clinically relevant safety concerns were observed based on the assessment of multiple safety endpoints.  Somnolence was the most frequently reported adverse event at the two higher doses, an expected finding as this compound is being developed as a treatment for patients suffering from insomnia disorder and as adjunctive treatment to concomitant antidepressant drug therapy in MDD.  This trial was a single center, double blind, placebo-controlled randomized single ascending dose study to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of MIN-202 in 24 healthy Japanese adult male study participants.
A number of supportive activities and clinical pharmacology studies are being conducted in anticipation of the next phase of clinical development with MIN-202 in both insomnia and MDD.  
 MIN-301
 We are developing MIN-301, a soluble recombinant form of the Neuregulin-1b1, or NRG-1b1, protein, for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. We believe MIN-301 has the potential to slow the onset of, and restore the brain tissue damage caused by, the disease. MIN-301 is produced by recombinant technology, which is a type of process that modifies the genetics of a biological organism to cause it to produce a particular product. MIN-301 is a peptide that contains the extracellular domain of the human neureglin-1 beta 1 protein and is produced using an Escherichia coli organism that is genetically engineered to express this peptide.   Once administrated, this peptide binds to a particular receptor, ErbB4, which produces certain biological effects. For instance, binding to ErbB4 modulates the levels of certain neurotransmitters such as GABA and glutamate in the brain, which are often unbalanced in individuals with Parkinson’s disease. Further, ErbB4 promotes oxygenation and metabolism of neurons, which could indicate MIN-301 could reverse the damage caused by Parkinson’s disease.
 Current treatments for Parkinson’s disease improve the symptoms of patients, but none have been proven to delay the onset of the disease, slow or prevent the progression of the disease or reverse its effects. Due to MIN-301’s novel mechanism of action that targets neurological deficits, we believe MIN-301 has the potential to address these unmet needs of patients and, if approved, may be used as an early-stage monotherapy as well as a complementary therapy to existing treatments.
 In January 2015 we announced results from a non-human primate study showing that treatment with an analog of MIN-301 resulted in improvements in a range of symptoms associated with a Parkinson’s disease model in primates. The results confirmed the beneficial effects of MIN-301 in non-primate preclinical models.
 The mechanism of action of MIN-301 is still under further investigation, but we believe this peptide has important characteristics, such as effects on oxidative stress reversal, effects on cell metabolism particularly adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, and effects on GABA and glutamate. Taken together, we believe the effects described above could protect dopaminergic neurons, which is a key element in the cause of Parkinson’s disease, and possibly on other sub-types of neurons and other brain cells such as glial cells. This indicates that MIN-301 may have a novel neuro-protecting and neuro-restorative profile. In view of this MIN-301 mechanism of action and based on a number of other studies performed by other research labs on neuregulin, we believe several other indications of the molecule may be pursued, such as for Alzheimer’s disease and other neuro-degenerative disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, and for other psychological disorders, such as schizophrenia, stroke and traumatic brain injury.
 Our next steps for the development for MIN-301 include continuing to conduct preclinical studies in preparation for an Investigational New Drug, or IND, or Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier, or IMPD filing, with a Phase I study expected to commence thereafter.
 License Agreements 
 MIN-101 License Agreement with MTPC 
 We have entered into a license agreement with MTPC dated as of August 30, 2007, as amended, or the MIN-101 License Agreement. Under the terms of the MIN-101 License Agreement, we acquired an exclusive license to the lead compound known as CYR-101 (subsequently renamed MIN-101), and other compounds with a similar structure and intended purpose and other data included within the valid claims of certain patents licensed to us under the MIN-101 License Agreement. The license is for world-wide rights other than certain countries in Asia, including China, Japan, India and South Korea. We will pay MTPC a tiered royalty for net sales of product by us or any of our affiliates or sublicensees containing the licensed compound at a range of percentages of the high single digits to the low teens depending on net sales of products under the MIN-101 License Agreement. We were also required to make certain milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development and commercial milestones, potentially up to $57.5 million for MIN-101 and up to $59.5 million for additional products. 
 10


In January 2014, we renegotiated the structure of the license for MIN-101 such that we are required to make milestone payments upon the achievement of one development milestone totaling $0.5 million and certain commercial milestones, which could total up to $47.5 million, in the aggregate. In addition, in the event that we sell the rights to the license, MTPC will be entitled to a percentage of milestone payments in the low teens and a percentage of royalties received by us in the low double digits. This license agreement has a term of the later of 12 years from the launch of the product in each country in our territory, or the expiration of our obligation to pay royalties, upon which we will have a fully paid-up, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable license. Our obligation to pay royalties continues, on a country-by-country basis, until the expiration of the last-to-expire patent that covers MIN-101 in each country in our territory. 
 MIN-117 License Agreement with MTPC 
 Sonkei entered into a license agreement with MTPC dated September 1, 2008, as amended, or the MIN-117 License Agreement. Under the terms of the MIN-117 License Agreement, we acquired an exclusive license to the lead compound known as SON-117 (subsequently renamed MIN-117) and other data included within the valid claims of certain patents licensed to us under the MIN-117 License Agreement. Sonkei paid MTPC an initial license fee of $0.5 million. The license is for world-wide rights other than certain countries in Asia, including China, Japan, India and South Korea. We will pay a tiered royalty for net sales of product by it or any of its affiliates or sublicensees containing the licensed compound ranging from the high single digits to the low teens depending on net sales of products under the MIN-117 License Agreement. Through the date of the agreement, as amended, we were required to make payments up to $57.5 million upon the achievement of certain commercial milestones. 
 In January 2014, we renegotiated the structure of the license for MIN-117 such that we are required to make certain milestone payments upon the achievement of certain commercial milestones up to $47.5 million. In addition, in the event that we sell the rights to the license, MTPC will be entitled to a percentage of milestone payments in the low teens and a percentage of royalties received by us in the low double digits. This license agreement has a term of the later of 10 years from the launch of the product in each country in our territory, or the expiration of our obligation to pay royalties, upon which we will have a fully paid-up, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable license. Our obligation to pay royalties continues, on a country-by-country basis, until the expiration of the last-to-expire patent that covers MIN-117 in each country in our territory. In April 2015, the Company amended the diligence milestone obligation under the license agreement for MIN-117 to extend the deadline from April 30, 2015 to June 30, 2015 to begin enrollment in a Phase IIa or Phase IIb study with MIN-117 in patients suffering major mood disorders. As consideration for the two-month extension, the Company paid MTPC, and recorded an expense for, $80,000 in the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company met the enrollment milestone obligation in June 2015.
 MIN-202 Co-Development and License Agreement with Janssen 
 We have entered into a co-development and license agreement with Janssen, dated as of February 12, 2014, pursuant to which, among other things, Janssen has granted us an exclusive license (even as to Janssen), with the right to sublicense, in the European Union, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Iceland and Norway, referred to as the Minerva Territory, under certain Janssen patent and patent applications to sell products containing any orexin 2 compound, controlled by Janssen and claimed in a Janssen patent right, as an active ingredient, or MIN-202, for any use in humans. In addition, upon regulatory approval in the Minerva Territory (and earlier if certain default events occur), we will have rights to manufacture or have a third party manufacture MIN-202. We have granted to Janssen an exclusive license, with the right to sublicense, under all patent rights and know-how controlled by us related to any orexin 2 compound, controlled by Janssen and claimed in a Janssen patent right, as an active ingredient, or MIN-202, to sell MIN-202 outside the Minerva Territory. This agreement will be in place until we have no further payment obligations, upon which we will have a non-exclusive, fully paid-up and royalty-free license in the Minerva Territory. We will also have the right of first negotiation for any sublicense that Janssen pursues in certain Asian and Latin American countries and the United States. Our obligation to pay royalties begins upon the first commercial sale of a licensed product in each country in which we have licensing rights and continues until the later of 10 years, the expiration of the last to expire intellectual property right owned by Janssen or the end of the period during which the licensed product is subject to regulatory exclusivity in each country. 
 In consideration of the licenses granted, we made an initial upfront payment of $22.0 million and recorded an expense in the year ended December 31, 2014. We will pay a quarterly royalty in the high single digits (subject to certain customary adjustments) on the aggregate net sales for MIN-202 products sold by us, our affiliates and sublicensees in the European Union. Janssen will pay a quarterly royalty in the high single digits (subject to certain customary adjustments) on the aggregate net sales for MIN-202 products sold by Janssen outside the European Union. 
 11


We will pay 40% of MIN-202 development costs related to the joint development of any MIN-202 products. However, subject to certain exceptions, our share of aggregate development costs may not exceed (i) $5.0 million for the period beginning from the effective date of the Janssen license and ending following the completion of certain Phase Ib clinical trials and animal toxicology studies and (ii) $24.0 million for the period beginning from the effective date of the Janssen license and ending following the completion of certain Phase II clinical trials.  
 Janssen has a right to opt out at the end of certain development milestones. The first milestone was the completion of a single dose Phase I clinical trial in patients with MDD, and following the first milestone, Janssen did not exercise its right to opt-out and terminate the co-development agreement. 
 We and Janssen both have the right to opt out of the Janssen license following subsequent development milestones the first of which was the completion of a certain Phase Ib clinical trial in patients with insomnia and certain toxicology studies in animals. On July 6, 2016, we and Janssen agreed that the parties had reached Decision Point 2, as defined under the co-development agreement. Neither party exercised its right to opt out and terminate the co-development agreement. 
 The next development milestone after which we and Janssen each have the right to opt out occurs within a certain period of time after completion of an interim analysis of a certain Phase II trial. If Janssen exercises its right to opt out and terminate the co-development agreement after this milestone, or after the last development milestone involving a certain Phase IIb clinical trial, our exclusive license (even as to Janssen) will expand to include the United States, Canada, and Mexico. We will also be entitled to a royalty in the mid-single digits from sales of MIN-202 by Janssen, or the Janssen Royalty. In addition, the royalties we have to pay Janssen for our sales of MIN-202 will reduce to the mid-single digits.  If we exercise our right to opt out and terminate the co-development agreement after this development milestone, then our license terminates. 
 If we terminate the co-development agreement at any time following the last development milestone, we will be entitled to the Janssen Royalty.
 Janssen may also terminate the agreement for our material breach or certain insolvency events, including if we are unable to fund our portion of the development costs. 
 Competition 
 MIN-101: Competition in the Pharmaceutical Market for the Treatment of Schizophrenia 
 Current drug therapies for the treatment of schizophrenia mainly target the positive symptoms of the disease. When patients present positive symptoms and require treatment, they are typically given either conventional “first-generation” antipsychotic medication, such as GlaxoSmithKline’s Thorazine Sanofi-Aventis’ Largactil (chlorpromazine) and Johnson & Johnson’s Haldol (haloperidol), or second-generation “atypical antipsychotics,” such as Novartis’ Clozaril (clozapine), Johnson & Johnson’s Risperdal (risperidone), AstraZeneca’s Seroquel (quetiapine), Eli Lilly’s Zyprexa (olanzapine) and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Abilify (aripiprazole). 
 Both types of existing therapies have limited ability to improve negative symptoms, and cognitive symptoms. In addition, existing therapies have extensive side effects such as weight gain, metabolic syndrome, sedation, nausea, movement disorders, restlessness, insomnia, impairment of cognitive skills, and prolactin increase. Since schizophrenia has a wide range of symptoms, multiple therapeutics are often prescribed in an attempt to address all aspects of the disease, compounding these side effects. 
 Given the focus of currently approved drug therapies for positive symptoms and their side effect profiles, we believe these therapies are unlikely to be directly competitive with MIN-101, which is intended to target primarily negative symptoms and cognitive impairment. However, new drug therapies in addition to MIN-101 are being developed to address the limitations of current therapies. Several new pharmacological approaches have been investigated. One targets a neurotransmitter called glutamate and the other targets a neurotransmitter called nicotine. Glutamate is the most predominant neurotransmitter system in maintaining the brain in an active state and is involved in maintaining accurate vigilance, attention and contributing to some cognitive skills. Nicotine is among the most predominant neurotransmitter system involved in learning and some other cognitive skills. Two additional approaches, one focusing on 5HT2 receptors and another on Dopamine D3 receptors, are currently in early stages of clinical development to treat negative symptoms. 
 Specific compounds under development that include negative symptoms as a target include Acadia Pharmaceuticals’ Pimavanserin, a selective serotonin inverse agonist (SSIA) that is approved for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson’s disease psychosis.  Other products in clinical development whose targets include negative symptoms are SyneuRx’s SND-11, Reviva Pharmaceuticals’ RP-5063 and Avanir Pharmaceuticals’ c-10003.  
 12


MIN-117: Competition in the Pharmaceutical Market for the Treatment of MDD 
 The pharmaceutical market for the treatment of MDD is largely comprised of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and atypical antipsychotics. By the time of MIN-117’s estimated launch, if approved by the FDA, a number of these high-selling antidepressants will be generic, and would be key competitors to MIN-117. These products include Forest’s Lexapro/Cipralex (escitalopram), Pfizer’s Zoloft (sertraline), GlaxoSmithKline’s Paxil/Seroxat (paroxetine), Eli Lilly’s Prozac (fluoxetine), Forest’s Viibryd (vilazodone), Pfizer’s Effexor (venlafaxine), Pfizer’s Pristiq (desvenlafaxine), Eli Lilly’s Cymbalta (duloxetine), AstraZeneca’s Seroquel (quetiapine) and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Abilify (aripiprazole). 
 Both SSRIs and SNRIs have significant limitations. SSRIs may lead to varying levels of weight gain and the impairment of cognitive skills and sexual function. In some cases, SNRIs have a worse safety and tolerability profile compared to SSRIs, in particular with respect to cardiovascular side effects. In addition, SSRIs and SNRIs are effective in only a part of the MDD patient population. Over one-third of patients fail to respond to two or more successive lines of antidepressant therapy. 
 Patients with TRMD often require treatment with several antidepressants, such as an SSRI or SNRI, combined with an “adjunct” therapy such as an antipsychotic or mood stabilizer. These antipsychotic compounds, such as AstraZeneca’s Seroquel (quetiapine) and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Abilify (aripiprazole), and mood stabilizers, such as Janssen Pharmaceuticals’ Topamax (topiramate), cause some slight improvements in efficacy but often have unacceptable side effects, including motor symptoms, sedation, lack of concentration, and weight gain. 
 MIN-117 may have a faster onset of action, fewer side effects than existing treatments, and could benefit non- or partial-responders, but a number of products in development could also compete with MIN-117. Lundbeck’s Vortioxetine (Brintellix), an SSRI with additional 5-HT receptor modulation activity, has been developed as a monotherapy and was recently approved by the FDA for use as a second-line therapy. Brintellix has been shown to have fewer side effects, in particular less impact on cognition, than existing therapies, though it does not show improved efficacy on depressive symptoms. In addition, Eli Lilly’s edivoxetine, a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, and Naurex’s GL4X-13 and AstraZeneca’s AZD6765, both targeting the NMDA receptor, are expected to have a faster onset of therapeutic effect as compared to currently available therapies. 
 MIN-202: Competition in the Pharmaceutical Market for the Treatment of Insomnia 
 Most of the pharmaceuticals on the market for insomnia target neurotransmitter pathways involved in depressing the brain activity, such as the histamine and GABA pathways, to induce a decrease in vigilance and attention, leading to sedation and sleep induction. The leading molecule among the current third generation of GABAergic drugs is Sanofi’s zolpidem, often marketed under the name Ambien, and is available in generic form. However, zolpidem requires careful utilization to avoid tolerance and drug abuse and extensive sleep studies have demonstrated that zolpidem does not restore physiological sleep and does not allow restorative sleep, which prevents good daytime performance. 
 Unlike existing therapies, MIN-202, if approved, is expected to inhibit wakefulness-promoting neurotransmitters, rather than activating sleep-promoting neurotransmitters. In August 2014, Merck & Co.’s dual orexin receptor antagonist, suvorexant, was approved by the FDA and is currently marketed under the name Belsomra®. We believe that Belsomra may be the only new insomnia pharmaceutical product to launch significantly in advance of MIN-202’s launch. If approved, we believe MIN-202, which is a single orexin receptor antagonist that targets orexin 2 pathways only and has a different pharmacokinetic profile from Belsomra, may have equal or superior efficacy, less residual sedation and impaired daytime functioning, and superior preservation of appropriate levels of REM as compared to Belsomra. 
 MIN-301: Competition in the Pharmaceutical Market for the Treatment of Parkinson’s Disease 
 Current treatments for Parkinson’s disease are intended to improve the symptoms of patients. The cornerstone of Parkinson’s therapy is levodopa, as it is the most effective therapy for reducing symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. However, levodopa may cause unpleasant systemic side effects, such as dyskinesias, and is often used with dopaminergics, such as DDIs, to manage these side effects. While initially effective, symptoms become increasingly difficult to control over time, and patients experience a pattern of motor complications that include motor fluctuations, dyskinesias, off-period dystonia, freezing and falls. Accordingly, there are advantages to deferring their use to later stages of the disease, or using them with other therapies to reduce the side effects of motor fluctuations and dyskinesia that 50% of levodopa patients experience. 
 Unlike currently available therapies, MIN-301, if approved, is intended to delay the onset of the disease, slow or prevent the progression of the disease or reverse its effects. Since MIN-301 is expected to target Parkinson’s disease, rather than merely its symptoms, and current therapies are not fully effective at improving the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease without side effects, we 
 13


believe that levodopa and other currently available generic products may not be directly competitive with MIN-301. While there are other drug therapies in development that will target the disease, such as gene and stem cell therapy and A2A receptor agonists, the majority of products in development for Parkinson’s disease are still in the pre-clinical stage. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We strive to protect the proprietary products and technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patent protection intended to cover the composition of our product candidates, their methods of use, related technology and other inventions that are important to our business. We also rely on trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
 The patent portfolios for our product candidates, which we own or are exclusively licensed to us, are summarized below. 
 MIN-101 
 Compound 
 Under our agreement with MTPC, we have an exclusive license to U.S. Patent No. 7,166,617, which claims the MIN-101 compound, as well as to corresponding patents in the following countries: Australia, Canada, Europe (Austria, Belgium, Republic of Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Monaco, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and United Kingdom), Israel, New Zealand, and Russia. 
 The US ‘617 patent expires no earlier than May 17, 2021, and a patent term extension of up to 5 years may be available in the U.S. The foreign patents expire no earlier than February 26, 2021.
 Pharmaceutical Compositions 
 We own a granted U.S. patent, a pending U.S. application and a corresponding PCT application which claim modified-release formulations of MIN-101. We plan to nationalize the PCT application in a number of foreign countries in 2017. The terms of existing and any future granted patents in this patent family will expire no earlier than November 30, 2035. 
Methods of Use 
 We own a granted patent and several pending applications in two patent families that are directed to methods of use of MIN-101 to treat negative and other symptoms of schizophrenia, sleep disorders, depression and other sigma-2 disorders or conditions. Patent family members that we own are applications pending in the United States and Brazil, Canada, Europe and Russia, and a granted patent in Russia. The terms of existing and any future granted patents in these two families will expire no earlier than July 20, 2031. 
 We also own two U.S. provisional patent applications filed in 2016, which are directed to the use of MIN-101 to treat negative symptoms in non-schizophrenic patients. We plan to file a PCT application in 2017 that claims priority to these patent applications. 
 MIN-117
 Compound
 Under our agreement with MTPC, we have an exclusive license to U.S. Patent No. 6,720,320, which claims the MIN-117 compound, as well as to corresponding patents in the following countries: Canada and Europe (Germany, France, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and United Kingdom). The U.S. ‘320 patent expires no earlier than August 13, 2020, and a patent term extension of up to 5 years may be available in the U.S. The foreign patents expire no earlier than May 22, 2020.
Pharmaceutical Compositions and Methods of Use 
 We own pending applications in a patent family that is directed to compositions comprising a low dose of MIN-117 and their use to treating depression, sleep disorders and improving cognitive impairment in patients with depression. The applications we own are pending in the United States, Europe and 11 other foreign countries. Patents that grant from these applications will expire no earlier than January 24, 2034. A patent term extension of up to five years may be available in the United States.
 14


We also own a U.S. provisional patent application filed in 2016, which is directed to the use of MIN-117 to treat anxiety disorders. We plan to file a PCT application in 2017 that claims priority to this patent application.
 MIN-202
 Compound 
 Under our agreement with Janssen, we are an exclusive licensee of European Patent EP2491038, which claims the MIN-202 compound and was validated in 39 European countries. The terms of these patents will expire no earlier than October 21, 2030.
Methods of Use 
 We also have rights to a U.S. provisional patent application filed in 2016, which is directed to the use of MIN-202 to treat depression.
 MIN-301
 We own a patent family that is directed to the use of MIN-301 for treating neurologic and psychiatric diseases, including Parkinson’s disease. This patent family includes patents granted in Australia, Europe (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and United Kingdom), Japan and Russia. Applications are pending in the United States, Canada, China, Hong Kong and Mexico. The term of existing and any future granted patents in this family will expire no earlier than November 17, 2028. A patent term extension of up to five years may be available in the United States.
Data and Marketing Exclusivity
 In addition to patent protection, our product candidates may also be eligible for data and marketing exclusivity protection in the United States (U.S.), European Union (EU) and certain other countries. If this protection is available, no competitor may use the data in our marketing application to obtain marketing approval of a generic product during the exclusivity period. 
 For small molecules, such as MIN-101, MIN-202 and MIN-117, the data and marketing exclusivity period is generally five years in the U.S. and ten years in the EU, measured from the FDA and EU approval dates, respectively. If MIN-301 is approved as a biologic product, it may be eligible for a data and marketing exclusivity period of twelve years in the U.S. and ten years in the EU. The data and marketing exclusivity periods in the U.S. and EU may be extended by 6 months of pediatric exclusivity if a qualifying pediatric study is performed.
 Manufacturing 
 We do not have any manufacturing facilities or personnel. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacturing of our product candidates for pre-clinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacturing if our product candidates receive marketing approval. Our product candidates are manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. The chemistry does not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities. 
Commercialization 
 We have not yet established a sales, marketing or product distribution infrastructure. We have global, except for most of Asia, commercialization rights for two of our product candidates, MIN-101 and MIN-117, and European Union commercialization rights for MIN-202. We have worldwide rights for MIN-301. We believe that it will be possible for us to access European and, in the case of MIN-101, MIN-117 and MIN-301, the United States and Latin America markets through a focused, specialized task force where the population dynamics would prove efficient. Alternatively, we may enter into distribution and other marketing arrangements with third parties for any of our drug candidates that obtain marketing approval. 
 Subject to receiving marketing approvals, we expect to commence commercialization activities by building a focused sales and marketing organization, either alone or through collaborations with third parties, in the United States, EU and Latin America to sell our product candidates. We believe that such an organization will be able to target the community of physicians who are the key specialists in treating the patient populations for which our product candidates are being developed. 
 15


We plan to build a marketing and sales management organization to create and implement marketing strategies for any products we commercialize ourselves. In parallel with building this organization, we plan to develop educational initiatives with respect to approved products and relationships with thought leaders in relevant fields of medicine. As part of our commitment to supporting optimal patient care and sustainable healthcare systems globally, we recognize the importance of fully understanding the needs of the patient communities we serve. We have learned that one of the best ways to accomplish this is by working with patient organizations, which are closely connected to patients’ most important concerns and interests. 
 Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization in the European Union 
 In Europe, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be submitted to the competent national regulatory authority and to independent ethics committees in each country in which we intend to conduct clinical trials. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with that country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed in that country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practices and other applicable regulatory requirements. A clinical trial may only be undertaken subject to certain conditions. The relevant ethics committee must give its opinion, before a clinical trial commences, on any issue requested. Clinical trials information must be entered into a European database. There are strict requirements in relation to the labeling and packaging of our product candidates, the verification of compliance with the provisions on good clinical and manufacturing practice and the notification of adverse events and serious adverse reactions. 
 Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may not market a medicinal product without marketing authorization. 
 There are four procedures for submitting a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, in the EU: (i) the national procedure, (ii) the mutual recognition procedure, or MRP; (iii) the decentralized, or DCP and (iv) the centralized procedure, or CP. The submission strategy for a given product will depend on the nature of the product, the target indication(s), the history of the product, and the marketing plan. The centralized procedure is compulsory for certain medicinal products which are produced by biotechnology processes, advanced therapy medicinal products and orphans. Besides the products falling under the mandatory scope, the centralized procedure is also open for medicinal products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation i.e. new active substances or other medicinal products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation. 
 The centralized procedure leads to approval of the product in all 28 EU member states and in Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Submission of one MAA thus leads to one assessment process and one authorization that allows access to the market of the entire EU. The process of the centralized procedure is triggered when the applicant submits an MAA to the EMA. The letter of intent also initiates the assignment of the Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur, who are the two appointed members of the Committee for Human Medicinal Products, or CHMP, representing two EU member states. 
 When using the MRP or DCP, the applicant must select which and how many EU member states in which to seek approval. In the case of an MRP, the applicant must initially receive national approval in one EU member state. This will be the so-called reference member state, or RMS, for the MRP. Then, the applicant seeks approval for the product in other EU member states, the so-called concerned member states, or CMS, in a second step: the mutual recognition process. For the DCP, the applicant will approach all chosen member states at the same time. To do so, the applicant will identify the RMS that will assess the submitted MAA and provide the other selected member states with the conclusions und results of the assessment. 
 However an innovator company enjoys a period of “data exclusivity” during which their pre-clinical and clinical trials data may not be referenced in the regulatory filings of another company (typically a generic company) for the same drug substance. 
 Data exclusivity in Europe is 8 years from the date of first authorization in Europe with an additional period of 2 years of “market exclusivity.” This is the period of time during which a generic company may not market an equivalent generic version of the originator’s pharmaceutical product. An additional 1 year may be obtained in where the innovator company is granted a marketing authorization within the above 8-year period for a significant new indication for the relevant medicinal product. 
 The Pediatric Regulation provides that an application for a new marketing authorization must include the results of all trials performed and details of all information collected in compliance with an agreed pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, unless a specific exemption is granted on the basis that pediatric use is not relevant - also the requirement can be deferred by agreement. 
 16


When the application for marketing authorization is made, the competent authority responsible for granting a marketing authorization must verify whether the application complies with the relevant requirements, including compliance with the agreed PIP. Assuming it does, the marketing authorization may be granted and the relevant results are included in the summary of product characteristics, or SmPC, for the product, along with a statement indicating compliance with the agreed PIP. The applicant then receives the six month extension to the SPC. It is not necessary for the product actually to be indicated for use in the pediatric population (for example, if the results show that that would not be appropriate). 
 U.S. FDA Approval Process 
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products.  MIN-301, a peptide, may be regulated as a biologic and additionally subject to the Public Health Service Act. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending Investigational New Drug Applications, or INDs, and NDAs, withdrawal of a marketing approval, imposition of clinical holds or termination of clinical trials, or issuance of Warning or Untitled Letters, product recalls, product seizures, refusal to allow imports or exports total or partial suspension of production or distribution, debarment, injunctions, fines, refusal of government contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement, civil penalties and criminal prosecution, including criminal fines and imprisonment. 
 FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. Pharmaceutical product development in the United States typically involves, among other things, pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and significant financial investment, and the actual time and cost required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease indicated for treatment. 
 Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, pharmacology, stability, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including good laboratory practices. The results of pre-clinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, any available clinical data or literature, and a proposed clinical trial protocol, among other items. Certain pre-clinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may be conducted after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has not placed a clinical hold on the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Should FDA place a clinical hold on the IND, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial may begin. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations, good clinical practices, or GCP, which include the ethical principles that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial, and that all trials be approved and monitored on an ongoing basis by an institutional review board, or IRB. Clinical trials must also be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, trial procedures, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, and a statistical analysis plan. Each protocol involving testing in U.S. subjects and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. The study protocol and informed consent information for subjects in clinical trials, along with all amendments, must also be submitted to an IRB for approval. 
 Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase I, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or subjects with the target disease or condition, the drug is tested to assess safety, metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase II usually involves trials in a limited subject population with the target disease or condition to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase II evaluations, generally two adequate and well-controlled Phase III trials are undertaken to obtain additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of subjects, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug’s safety and effectiveness after approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase IV trials. Progress reports detailing 
 17


the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Information about certain clinical trials, including a description of the study and study results must also be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their clinicaltrials.gov website. 
 The manufacture of investigational drugs for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to the Current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs. Investigational drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients, imported into the United States are also subject to regulation by FDA relating to their labeling and distribution. Further, the export of investigational drug products outside of the United States is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as United States export requirements. 
 The FDA may suspend or terminate a clinical trial, or impose other sanctions, at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or if it believes that the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects, or may impose other conditions on the conduct of the research. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group regularly reviews accumulated data and advises the study sponsor regarding the continuing safety of trial subjects, potential trial subjects, and the continuing validity and scientific merit of the clinical trial. Sponsors may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on safety concerns, a lack of evidence of drug efficacy, evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 
 After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all pre-clinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Under federal law, the submission of most marketing applications is subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved application are also subject to annual product and establishment fees. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a marketing application or supplement to a marketing application for a new active ingredient, indication, dosage form, dosage regimen or route of administration must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation. 
 The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, either during the application process or after the approval of the drug to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks, and to identify any new risks that were not apparent in clinical investigations. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. 
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. The FDA has a goal of reviewing ninety percent of applications for non-priority drug products within 10 months of the FDA’s acceptance of the full application for filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA under certain circumstances. 
 Under the FDCA and FDA guidance, before approving a drug for which no active ingredient (including any ester or salt of the active ingredients) has previously been approved by the FDA or a first-of-a-kind, first-in-class biologic, FDA must either refer that drug to an external advisory committee or provide in an action letter, a summary of the reasons why FDA did not refer the drug to an advisory committee. The external advisory committee review may also be required for other drugs because of certain other issues, including clinical trial design, safety and effectiveness, and public health questions. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.

Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless the facility, and all of its subcontractors and contract manufacturers, demonstrate compliance with cGMPs, and provide adequate assurance that they can consistently produce the product within required specifications, and the NDA contains data that provides substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective for the indication sought in the proposed labeling. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs before approving a marketing application. After the FDA evaluates the marketing application and the manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter, or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA may issue an approval letter. 
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy and may impose other conditions, including labeling restrictions, limitations on the approved indications, contraindications, warnings or precautions, such as black boxed warnings, distribution restrictions or other risk-management mechanisms under a REMS which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing trials or surveillance programs. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, manufacturing processes or facilities, or new safety issues arise, a new or supplemental NDA or a post-implementation notification or other report may be required or requested depending on the change, which may require additional data or additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, and reporting of adverse experiences with the product and drug shortages. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or other labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and prior FDA review and approval. 
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other regulatory requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and may require prior FDA approval or notification before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. 
 Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market trials or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, Untitled Letters, Warning Letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of administrative civil or criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment.

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Although physicians, in the practice of medicine, may prescribe approved drugs for unapproved indications if in their professional medical judgment they believe it to be appropriate, pharmaceutical companies may only market and promote their drug products for the FDA approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws prohibiting the marketing and promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly marketed or promoted 
 19


off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including, among others, criminal and civil penalties under the FDCA and False Claims Act, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and mandatory compliance programs. 
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. 
 Moreover, the Drug Quality and Security Act imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product and tracking and tracing. 
 Federal and State Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security and Transparency Laws 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products, other federal and state healthcare laws restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback and false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers. Applicable state anti-kickback and false claims laws may be broader in scope than federal law and may apply regardless of payor,
 in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. 
 We may also be subject to state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.  In addition, we may be subject to reporting requirements under state transparency laws, as well as state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government that otherwise restricts certain payments that may be made to healthcare providers and entities.
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal and civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 The commercial success of our product candidates and our ability to commercialize any approved product candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for our product candidates, once approved. 
 Government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors generally decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels for healthcare. In particular, in the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such treatments. Sales of our product candidates will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be covered by third-party payors. The market for our product candidates will depend significantly on access to third-party payors’ formularies without prior authorization, step therapy, or other limitations such as approved lists of treatments for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. Also, third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. Coverage and reimbursement for therapeutic products can differ significantly from payor to payor. A third-party payors’ decision to provide coverage for a medical product or service does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that adequate coverage and reimbursement will be obtained. 
 In the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and other third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs and are increasingly imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage. 
 Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and utilization, which may adversely 
 20


affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care organizations, competition within therapeutic classes, availability of generic equivalents or biosimilars, judicial decisions and governmental laws related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical coverage and reimbursement policies and pricing in general. The cost containment measures that healthcare payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved product candidates. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain and maintain governmental or private third-party coverage or adequate reimbursement for our product candidates in whole or in part. Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices.  Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.
 Healthcare Reform
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering enacting or have enacted a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals designed to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. 
 In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, ACA), which substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impact the pharmaceutical industry.  In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, or the Budget Resolution, that authorizes the implementation of legislation that would repeal portions of the ACA. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to replace elements of the ACA that are repealed. We expect that healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that may be charged for any of our product candidates, if approved. 
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts.
