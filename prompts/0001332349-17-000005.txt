Overview
 
Our Business
 
As of December 31, 2016, we are the largest operator of senior living communities in the United States based on total capacity, with 1,055 communities in 47 states and the ability to serve approximately 103,000 residents. We offer our residents access to a full continuum of services across the most attractive sectors of the senior living industry. We operate independent living, assisted living and dementia-care communities and continuing care retirement centers ("CCRCs"). Through our ancillary services programs, we also offer a range of outpatient therapy, home health and hospice services to residents of many of our communities and to seniors living outside of our communities.
 
As of December 31, 2016, we owned or leased 902 communities (77,284 units) and provided management services with respect to 153 communities (26,090 units) for third parties or unconsolidated ventures in which we have an ownership interest. As of December 31, 2016, we operated 129 retirement center communities (24,339 units), 851 assisted living communities (58,477 units) and 75 CCRCs (20,558 units).  The majority of our units are located in campus settings or communities containing multiple services, including CCRCs.  As of December 31, 2016, our ancillary services platform included networks in 28 states with the ability to provide home health services to approximately 61.7% of our units, outpatient therapy to approximately 18.0% of our units and hospice services to approximately 18.3% of our units.  During the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated approximately 82.1% of our resident fee revenues from private pay customers. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 37.9% of our resident and management fee revenues were generated from owned communities, 49.1% from leased communities, 11.3% from our ancillary services business and 1.7% from management fees from communities we operate on behalf of third parties or unconsolidated ventures.
 
We intend to be the leading provider of senior living solutions, and we believe that we are positioned to take advantage of favorable demographic trends over time. We also believe that we operate in the most attractive sectors of the senior living industry with opportunities to increase our revenues through providing a combination of housing, hospitality services, ancillary services and health care services. Our senior living communities offer residents a supportive home-like setting, assistance with activities of daily living ("ADLs") (such as eating, bathing, dressing, toileting and transferring/walking) and, in certain communities, licensed skilled nursing services. We also provide ancillary services, including outpatient therapy, home health services and hospice services, to our residents. By providing residents with a range of service options as their needs change, we provide greater continuity of care, enabling seniors to "age-in-place" and thereby maintain residency with us for a longer period of time. The ability of residents to age-in-place is also beneficial to our residents and their families who are concerned with care decisions for their elderly relatives.
 
Strategy
 
During 2014, we acquired Emeritus Corporation ("Emeritus"), a senior living service provider focused on operating residential style communities throughout the United States. At the closing of the merger, the size of our consolidated portfolio increased by 493 communities, significantly increasing our scale and providing us entry into 10 new states. Following the acquisition, we have executed on our plans to integrate legacy Emeritus locations into our systems and infrastructure platform. In 2015, we completed the final cutover waves of integration activities, and we now have a common system and infrastructure platform in place.
 
With integration activities largely completed, during 2016 we undertook a comprehensive review of our organizational effectiveness as part of updating our strategy.  During 2016, we completed this review and adopted a refined strategy:  to achieve consistent operational excellence in our core businesses.  Execution on our strategy is intended to maximize the value of our existing platform and to build the foundation for further growth.
 
We have identified five key priorities for which we have developed initiatives or are developing initiatives to support our strategy and have created a transformation process to develop cross-functional initiatives directly tied to key priorities. These five priorities include:
 
 
• | Enhance our customer and associate experience. With this priority, we are simplifying the role of the executive directors of our communities to allow them to focus on our customers and associates, improving our model for recruiting and retaining community associates, implementing new talent development and training programs, and will continue to implement an expanded system to gauge and improve the quality of our relationships with our customers and associates. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Improve our marketing and sales processes. We have designed and begun implementation of a network sales model, have begun to design and implement a new lead management system, and have begun segmenting our communities to align operating standards with optimal market positions. We will continue to leverage our brand recognition while pursuing a multi-layered marketing approach, which includes customized marketing campaigns in markets and communities with the highest potential. Our network sales model is designed to better coordinate our sales efforts among our communities within a given market. Our community segmentation efforts are intended to identify optimal levels of price, service offerings, amenities and programs to be offered in our communities based on local demand so that we can adjust our operating standards to create differentiated value to meet the needs of our customers. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Simplify our organization. We are actively identifying and executing on initiatives to simplify our organization in order to align our structure around our customers' priorities while improving our operational effectiveness and efficiency. Through our realignment efforts, we have reduced spans and layers in our organization to increase accountability and bring decision making closer to our customers. We also plan to continue to establish corporate shared service centers of excellence to reduce costs and improve our effectiveness. We expect that our organizational simplification and streamlining efforts will lead to opportunities for general and administrative expense efficiencies. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Optimize our portfolio and leverage scale. Our initiatives will focus on maximizing the value and performance of our ancillary services business, optimizing our community portfolio, capturing synergies from our scale, and making strategic and cost effective capital expenditure investments. Through our ongoing portfolio optimization initiative, we intend to dispose of owned and leased communities and restructure leases in order to simplify and streamline our business, to increase the quality and durability of our cash flow, to improve our liquidity, and to reduce our debt and lease leverage. Disposals of owned assets may take the form of outright sales or contributions into ventures in which we would have an ownership interest, and we may desire to retain management rights on disposed assets. We also intend to restructure existing leases, including those with approaching maturities, which may take the form of non-renewal of leases, negotiation of revised lease terms, termination of leases in favor of venture structures in which we would have an interest and, to a lesser degree, the purchase of leased communities, particularly where we have favorable purchase options. Our criteria for identifying communities and transactions as part of this initiative include the market value of communities and their underlying performance, lease terms, capital requirements, location, market dynamics, physical plant condition and proximity to other communities in our portfolio. We expect to continue our capital expenditure programs, including our Program Max initiative through which we intend to expand, renovate, redevelop and reposition our communities where economically advantageous. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Innovate for growth. We intend to evaluate, test and implement innovations that enhance customer and associate experience and to explore models to drive new economics. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



While our focus will be on executing our refined strategy, we plan to continue to evaluate and, where opportunities arise, selectively purchase existing operating companies, senior living communities, including those that we currently lease or manage, and ancillary services companies.  Such acquisitions may be pursued on our own, or through our investments in ventures.
 
We believe that successful execution upon our strategy and the initiatives supporting our strategy will enable us to grow stockholder value and better fulfill our mission by satisfying more customers, building improved relationships between us, our associates and our customers, and by improving our occupancy, revenue, expenses, and liquidity, by increasing the quality and durability of our cash flow, and by reducing our debt and lease leverage.
 
Portfolio Optimization Activities During 2016
 
During fiscal 2016, we entered into or completed several transactions as part of our efforts to optimize our portfolio through disposing of owned and leased communities and restructuring leases in order to simplify and streamline our business, to increase the quality and durability of our cash flow, to improve our liquidity and to reduce our debt and lease leverage.  The transactions included our entering into agreements to sell 51 owned communities and completing the dispositions of 51 owned communities and extinguishment of $94.5 million of related mortgage debt.  We also entered into agreements to terminate triple net leases with respect to 97 communities, seven of which were terminated during 2016.  Four of such communities were contributed to an existing unconsolidated venture in which we have an equity interest, and we expect 64 of such communities to be contributed to a venture in which we will have an equity interest.  Each of these transactions are summarized below.  We will continue to actively explore additional opportunities to optimize our portfolio through disposing of owned and leased communities, restructuring leases and investing in our Program Max initiative.

Dispositions of Owned Communities
 
We began 2016 with 17 of our owned communities (1,623 units) classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we entered into agreements to sell an additional 51 communities (3,219 units) and completed the dispositions of 51 owned communities (3,356 units).  These transactions are summarized below.

• | During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we sold seven of the 17 communities held for sale as of December 31, 2015 for an aggregate sales price of $46.7 million. The results of operations of these communities are reported in the Assisted Living (six communities; 389 units) and CCRCs – Rental (one community; 359 units) segments within the consolidated financial statements through the respective disposition dates. The remaining 10 communities were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2016. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we entered into an agreement with a third party to sell a 12-state portfolio of 44 owned communities for an aggregate sales price of $252.5 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we sold 32 of these communities (1,771 units) for an aggregate sales price of $177.5 million. During the three months ended December 31, 2016, we sold nine of these communities (444 units) for an aggregate sales price of $47.7 million. The results of operations of these 41 communities are reported within the Assisted Living segment within the consolidated financial statements through the respective disposition dates. During the three months ended December 31, 2016, the agreement was amended to remove one community (63 units) from the portfolio, and the aggregate sales price of the portfolio was decreased by $4.7 million. The remaining two communities (175 units) within the portfolio were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2016. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | During 2016, we identified seven additional owned communities (766 units) as held for sale. During the three months ended December 31, 2016, we sold three of these communities (393 units) for an aggregate sales price of $33.0 million. The results of operations of these three communities are reported in the Assisted Living (one community; 20 units), CCRCs – Rental (one community; 276 units) and Retirement Center (one community; 97 units) segments through the respective disposition dates. The remaining four communities (373 units) were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2016. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



As of December 31, 2016, $97.8 million was recorded as assets held for sale and $60.5 million of mortgage debt was included in the current portion of long-term debt within our consolidated balance sheet with respect to the 16 communities held for sale as of such date.  This debt will either be repaid with the proceeds from the sales or be assumed by the prospective purchasers. The results of operations of the 16 communities are reported in the following segments within the consolidated financial statements:  Assisted Living (13 communities; 1,126 units) and CCRCs – Rental (three communities; 297 units).  The 16 communities had resident fee revenue of $47.2 million and facility operating expenses of $42.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.
 
The closings of the sales of the unsold communities classified as held for sale are subject to receipt of regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, and are expected to occur in the next 12 months; however, there can be no assurance that the transactions will close or, if they do, when the actual closings will occur.
 
Dispositions and Restructurings of Leased Communities
 
On November 1, 2016, we announced that we had entered into agreements to, among other things, terminate triple-net leases with respect to 97 communities, four of which would be contributed to an existing unconsolidated venture in which we hold an equity interest and 64 of which would be owned by a venture in which we expect to acquire a non-controlling interest. The transactions include the following components:

• | HCP and Blackstone entered into an agreement pursuant to which HCP has agreed to sell 64 communities (5,967 units)—which are currently leased to us at above market rates and have a remaining average lease term of approximately 12 years—to Blackstone for a purchase price of $1.125 billion. Separately, we entered into an agreement with Blackstone pursuant to which we have agreed to form a venture (the "Blackstone Venture") into which Blackstone will contribute the 64 communities and into which we expect to contribute a total of approximately $170.0 million to purchase a 15% equity interest, terminate the above market leases, and fund our share of anticipated closing costs and working capital. Following closing, we will manage the communities on behalf of the venture. We expect the Blackstone Venture transactions to close during the three months ended March 31, 2017. The results of operations of the 64 communities are reported in the following segments within the consolidated financial statements: Assisted Living (48 communities; 3,364 units), Retirement Centers (nine communities; 1,180 units) and CCRCs-Rental (seven communities; 1,423 units). The 64 communities had resident fee revenue of $264.7 million, facility operating expenses of $182.0 million and cash lease payments of $88.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

• | We and HCP agreed to terminate triple-net leases with respect to eight communities (867 units). HCP agreed to contribute immediately thereafter four of such communities, consisting of 527 units, to an existing unconsolidated venture with HCP in which we have a 10% equity interest. During the three months ended December 31, 2016, the triple-net leases with respect to seven communities (773 units) were terminated and HCP contributed four of the communities to the existing unconsolidated venture. The triple-net lease with respect to the remaining community was terminated during January 2017. The results of operations of the eight communities are reported in the following segments within the consolidated financial statements: Assisted Living (six communities; 514 units), Retirement Centers (one community; 109 units) and CCRCs-Rental (one community; 244 units). The eight communities had resident fee revenue of $41.1 million, facility operating expenses of $30.6 million and cash lease payments of $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

• | We and HCP agreed to terminate triple-net leases with respect to 25 communities (2,031 units), which we expect to occur in stages through the end of fiscal 2017. The results of operations of the 25 communities are reported in the following segments within the consolidated financial statements: Assisted Living (23 communities; 1,759 units) and CCRCs-Rental (two communities; 272 units). The 25 communities had resident fee revenue of $72.2 million, facility operating expenses of $58.6 million and cash lease payments of $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The closings of the various pending transactions with HCP and Blackstone are subject to the satisfaction of various closing conditions, including (where applicable) the receipt of regulatory approvals; however, there can be no assurance that the transactions will close or, if they do, when the actual closings will occur.
 
Program Max Initiative
 
During fiscal 2016, we also made progress on our Program Max initiative under which we expand, renovate, redevelop and reposition certain of our existing communities where economically advantageous. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we invested $23.9 million on Program Max projects, net of $19.9 million of third party lessor reimbursements, which included the completion of 8 expansion or conversion projects which resulted in 237 additional units.  We currently have 10 Program Max projects that have been approved, most of which have begun construction and are expected to generate 129 net new units.
 
The Senior Living Industry
 
 The senior living industry has undergone dramatic growth in the last twenty years, marked by the emergence of the assisted living segment in the mid-1990s, and it remains highly fragmented and characterized by numerous local and regional operators. We are one of a limited number of large operators that provide a broad range of community locations and service level offerings at varying price levels.
 
Beginning in 2007, the industry was affected negatively by the downturn in the general economy, which resulted in a near halt in construction of new units. The industry experienced a slow recovery in occupancy and rate growth beginning in 2010 according to the National Investment Center for the Seniors Housing & Care Industry ("NIC").  In more recent years, as the economy and senior living industry have improved, the industry has attracted increased investment resulting in increased development of new senior housing supply.  According to NIC data, industry occupancy increased modestly through 2015, as the pace of absorption outpaced inventory growth slightly.  During the year ended December 31, 2016, NIC data shows that industry occupancy began to decrease as a result of new openings, and based on projections of NIC, industry occupancy is expected to be flat through 2017.  During 2016, we experienced an adverse change in the competitive environment for our consolidated senior housing portfolio, with significant new competition opening in a number of our markets. We have addressed such competition through our increased use of discounts and incentives (which has impacted rate growth in certain markets), additional local marketing efforts, additional associate retention efforts and, where appropriate, capital projects.  We expect this elevated rate of new openings to continue through most of fiscal 2017.
 
We believe that a number of trends will contribute to the continued growth of the senior living industry in coming years. The primary market for senior living services is individuals age 75 and older. According to U.S. Census data, that group is projected to be the fastest growing age cohort over the next twenty years. As a result of scientific and medical breakthroughs over the past 30 years, seniors are living longer. Due to demographic trends, and continuing advances in science, nutrition and healthcare, the senior population will continue to grow, and we expect the demand for senior living services to continue to increase in future years.
 
We believe the senior living industry has been and will continue to be impacted by several other trends. Increased longevity results in increasing frailty in seniors, soaring rates of dementia among the elderly, and a growing burden of chronic illness and chronic conditions. As a result of increased mobility in society, a reduction of average family size and increased number of two-wage earner couples, families struggle to provide care for seniors and look for alternatives outside of their family for their care. There is a growing consumer awareness among seniors and their families concerning the types of services provided by senior living operators, which has further contributed to the demand for senior living services. Also, the current prospective senior customer possesses greater financial resources than in the past, which makes it more likely that they are able to afford to live in market-rate senior housing. Seniors in the demographic cohort that were born between 1925 and 1945 have a significant amount of income generated from savings, pensions, and social security, along with a strong asset base.
  8
 
Challenges in our industry include increased state and local regulation of the assisted living and skilled nursing sectors, which has led to an increase in the cost of doing business. The regulatory environment continues to intensify in the number and types of laws and regulations affecting us, accompanied by increased enforcement activity by state and local officials. In addition, like other companies, our financial results may be negatively impacted by increasing employment costs including salaries, wages and benefits, such as health care benefit coverage, for our employees. Increases in the costs of food, utilities, insurance, and real estate taxes may also have a negative impact on our financial results.
 
In addition, there continue to be various federal and state legislative and regulatory proposals to implement cost containment measures that would limit payments to healthcare providers in the future. We cannot predict what action, if any, Congress will take on reimbursement policies of the Medicare program or what future rule changes the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS") will implement. Changes in the reimbursement policies of the Medicare program could have an adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations and cash flow.
 
 Effective October 1, 2012, certain Medicare Part B therapy services exceeding a specified threshold are subject to a pre-payment manual medical review process. The review process has had an adverse effect on the provision and billing of services for patients and could negatively impact therapist productivity. These Medicare Part B therapy cap exception requirements, including the applicable pre-approval requirements, could also negatively impact the revenues, results of operations and cash flow relating to our outpatient therapy services business. Pursuant to the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, which was signed by the President on April 16, 2015, the manual review process will be replaced with a new review program to be developed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
 
Certain per person annual limits on Medicare reimbursement for therapy services became effective in 2006, subject to certain exceptions. These exceptions are currently scheduled to expire on December 31, 2017. If these exceptions are modified or not extended beyond that date, our revenues, results of operations and cash flow relating to our outpatient therapy services could be materially adversely impacted.
 
To help fund the expansion of health care coverage to previously uninsured people, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the "Affordable Care Act") outlines certain reductions in Medicare reimbursements for various health care providers, including home health agencies and skilled nursing facilities, as well as other changes to Medicare payment methodologies. Among other changes, the Affordable Care Act calls for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to "rebase" reimbursements for home health, which has resulted in a decrease in home health reimbursement that began in 2014 and is being phased-in over a four year period through 2017, and to establish productivity adjustments reducing the reimbursement rates that we would have otherwise received. For home health in 2017, CMS has implemented a net 0.7% reimbursement reduction, consisting of a 2.8% market basket inflation increase, less a 0.3% productivity reduction, a 2.3% rebasing adjustment, and a 0.9% reduction to account for industry wide case-mix growth. We expect the total effect of the changes for 2017 to reduce our reimbursement by approximately 3.2%.
  
On June 8, 2016, CMS announced that it is implementing a 3-year Medicare pre-claim review demonstration for home health services in the states of Illinois, Florida, Texas, Michigan and Massachusetts. CMS began the pre-claim review demonstration in Illinois in August 2016 and will begin the demonstration in Florida in April 2017, and CMS is expected to announce in coming months staggered start dates for the other states. We derive a significant portion of our home health revenue from these states. The pre-claim review is a process through which a request for provisional affirmation of coverage is submitted for review before a final claim is submitted for payment. The pre-claim review demonstration may result in an increase in administrative costs or reimbursement delays related to home health services in such states, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow.


Our History
 
We were formed as a Delaware corporation in June 2005 for the purpose of combining two leading senior living operating companies, Brookdale Living Communities, Inc. ("BLC") and Alterra Healthcare Corporation ("Alterra"). BLC and Alterra had been operating independently since 1986 and 1981, respectively. On November 22, 2005, we completed our initial public offering of common stock, and on July 25, 2006, we acquired American Retirement Corporation ("ARC"), another leading senior living provider that had been operating independently since 1978. On September 1, 2011, we completed the acquisition of Horizon Bay, the then-ninth largest operator of senior living communities in the United States.
 
On July 31, 2014, we completed the merger contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 20, 2014, by and among Emeritus Corporation, a Washington corporation, Brookdale Senior Living Inc., and Broadway Merger Sub Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of ours, pursuant to which the subsidiary merged with and into Emeritus, with Emeritus continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours. At the time of the merger, Emeritus was the second largest operator of senior living communities in the United States.

Our Communities and Service Offerings
 
We offer a variety of senior living housing and service alternatives in communities located across the United States. Our communities consist of retirement center communities, assisted living communities, rental CCRCs and entry fee CCRCs. We manage certain of our communities for third parties or unconsolidated ventures in which we have an ownership interest pursuant to management agreements. In addition, through our ancillary services programs, we provide outpatient therapy, home health and hospice services to residents of many of our communities and to seniors living outside of our communities.
Retirement Centers
 
Our retirement center communities are primarily designed for middle to upper income seniors generally age 75 and older who desire an upscale residential environment providing the highest quality of service.  The majority of our retirement center communities consist of both independent and assisted living units in a single community, which allows residents to "age-in-place" by providing them with a continuum of senior independent and assisted living services. While the number varies depending upon the particular community, as of December 31, 2016 approximately 78.2% of all of the units at our retirement center communities are independent living units, with the balance of units licensed for assisted living.
 
Our retirement center communities are large multi-story buildings containing on average 189 units with extensive common areas and amenities. Residents may choose from studio, one-bedroom and two-bedroom units, depending upon the specific community.  Each retirement center community provides residents with basic services such as meal service, 24-hour emergency response, housekeeping, concierge services, transportation and recreational activities. Most of these communities also offer custom tailored supplemental care services at an additional charge, which may include medication reminders, check-in services and escort and companion services.
 
In addition to the basic services, our retirement center communities that include assisted living also provide residents with supplemental care service options to provide assistance with ADLs. The levels of care provided to residents vary from community to community depending, among other things, upon the licensing requirements and healthcare regulations of the state in which the community is located.
 
Residents in our retirement center communities are able to maintain their residency for an extended period of time due to the range of service options available to residents (not including skilled nursing) as their needs change.  Residents with cognitive or physical frailties and higher level service needs are accommodated with supplemental services in their own units or, in certain communities, are cared for in a more structured and supervised environment on a separate wing or floor. These communities also generally have a dedicated assisted living staff, including nurses at the majority of communities, and separate assisted living dining rooms and activity areas.
 
Retirement center communities that we own or lease are included in our Retirement Centers segment, and retirement center communities for which we provide management services for third parties or unconsolidated ventures in which we have an ownership interest are included in our Management Services segment. As of December 31, 2016, our Retirement Center segment consisted of 93 retirement center communities with 17,094 units, representing 16.5% of our total senior living capacity, and 36 retirement center communities with 7,275 units were included in our Management Services segment, representing 7.0% of our total senior living capacity. In the aggregate, these retirement center communities represented 23.5% of our total senior living capacity.
 
Assisted Living
 
Our assisted living communities offer housing and 24-hour assistance with ADLs to mid-acuity frail and elderly residents. Our assisted living communities include both freestanding, multi-story communities with more than 50 beds and smaller, freestanding single story communities with less than 50 beds. Depending upon the specific location, the community may include (i) private studio, one-bedroom and one-bedroom deluxe apartments, or (ii) individual rooms for one or two residents in wings or "neighborhoods" scaled to a single-family home, which includes a living room, dining room, patio or enclosed porch, laundry room and personal care area, as well as a caregiver work station.
 
We also operate memory care communities, which are freestanding assisted living communities specially designed for residents with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias requiring the attention, personal care and services needed to help cognitively impaired residents maintain a higher quality of life. Our memory care communities have from 8 to 75 beds and some are part of a campus setting which includes a freestanding assisted living community.
 
All residents at our assisted living and memory care communities receive the basic care level, which includes ongoing health assessments, three meals per day and snacks, coordination of special diets planned by a registered dietitian, assistance with coordination of physician care, social and recreational activities, housekeeping and personal laundry services. In some locations we offer our residents exercise programs and programs designed to address issues associated with early stages of Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. In addition, we offer at additional cost, higher levels of personal care services to residents at these communities who are very physically frail or experiencing early stages of Alzheimer's disease or other dementia and who require more frequent or intensive physical assistance or increased personal care and supervision due to cognitive impairments.
  10
 
As a result of their progressive decline in cognitive abilities, residents at our memory care communities typically require higher levels of personal care and services and therefore pay higher monthly service fees. Specialized services include assistance with ADLs, behavior management and an activities program, the goal of which is to provide a normalized environment that supports residents' remaining functional abilities. Whenever possible, residents participate in all facets of daily life at the residence, such as assisting with meals, laundry and housekeeping.
 
Assisted living communities (including memory care communities) that we own or lease are included in our Assisted Living segment, and assisted living communities for which we provide management services for third parties or unconsolidated ventures in which we have an ownership interest are included in our Management Services segment. As of December 31, 2016, our Assisted Living segment consisted of 768 assisted living communities with 50,686 units, representing 49.0% of our total senior living capacity, and 83 assisted living communities with 7,791 units were included in our Management Services segment, representing 7.5% of our total senior living capacity. In the aggregate, these assisted living communities represented 56.6% of our total senior living capacity.
 
As of December 31, 2016, we provide memory care services at 540 of our communities, aggregating 13,436 memory care units across our segments. These communities include 120 freestanding memory care communities with 4,666 units included in our Assisted Living segment.
 
CCRCs
 
Our CCRCs are large communities that offer a variety of living arrangements and services to accommodate all levels of physical ability and health. Most of our CCRCs have independent living, assisted living and skilled nursing available on one campus or within the immediate market, and some also include memory care/Alzheimer's service areas.
 
CCRCs that we own or lease are included in our CCRCs - Rental segment, and CCRCs for which we provide management services for third parties or unconsolidated ventures in which we have an ownership interest are included in our Management Services segment. As of December 31, 2016, our CCRCs - Rental segment included 41 CCRCs with 9,534 units, representing 9.2% of our total senior living capacity, and 34 CCRCs with 11,024 units were included in our Management Services segment, representing 10.7% of our total senior living capacity. In the aggregate, these CCRCs represented 19.9% of our total senior living capacity.
 
Twenty of our CCRCs, of which 17 are included in the Management Services segment, allow for residents in the independent living apartment units to pay a one-time upfront entrance fee, typically $100,000 to $400,000 or more, which is partially refundable in certain circumstances. We refer to these communities as entry fee CCRCs. The amount of the entrance fee varies depending upon the type and size of the dwelling unit, the type of contract plan selected, whether the contract contains a lifecare benefit (i.e., a healthcare discount) for the resident, the amount and timing of the refund, and other variables. These agreements are subject to regulations in various states. In addition to their initial entrance fee, residents under all of our entrance fee agreements also pay a monthly service fee, which entitles them to the use of certain amenities and services. Since entrance fees are paid upon initial occupancy, the monthly fees are generally less than fees at a comparable rental community. The refundable portion of a resident's entrance fee is generally refundable within a certain number of months or days following contract termination or upon the sale of the unit, or in some agreements, upon the resale of a comparable unit or 12 months after the resident vacates the unit. In addition, some entrance fee agreements entitle the resident to a refund of the original entrance fee paid plus a percentage of the appreciation of the unit upon resale. As of December 31, 2016, our CCRCs - Rental segment included three entry fee CCRCs with 1,164 units, representing less than one percent of our total senior living capacity, and 17 entry fee CCRCs with 8,070 units were included in our Management Services segment, representing 11.1% of our total senior living capacity.
 
Brookdale Ancillary Services
 
Through our ancillary services programs, we currently provide outpatient therapy, home health and hospice services, as well as education and wellness programs, to residents of many of our communities and to seniors living outside of our communities. These programs are focused on wellness and physical fitness to allow residents to maintain maximum independence. These services provide many continuing education opportunities for seniors and their families through health fairs, seminars, and other consultative interactions. The therapy services we provide include physical, occupational, speech and other specialized therapy and home health services. The home health services we provide include skilled nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathology, home health aide services, and social services as needed. These services may be reimbursed under the Medicare program or paid directly by residents from private pay sources, and revenues are recognized as services are provided. We believe that our ancillary services offerings are unique in the senior living industry and that we have a significant advantage over our competitors with respect to providing ancillary services because of our established infrastructure and experience.
 
Our Brookdale Ancillary Services segment includes the outpatient therapy, home health and hospice services provided to residents of many of our communities and to seniors living outside of our communities. The Brookdale Ancillary Services segment does not include the inpatient therapy services provided in our skilled nursing units, which are included in the CCRCs - Rental segment. During the three months ended December 31, 2016, we significantly reduced the number of outpatient therapy clinics located in our communities as lower reimbursement rates and lower utilization made the business less attractive.

Management Services
 
We operate certain of our communities pursuant to management agreements. In some of these cases, the community is owned by third parties and, in other cases, the community is owned in an unconsolidated venture in which we have an ownership interest. Under the management agreements for these communities, we receive management fees as well as reimbursed expenses, which represent the reimbursement of certain expenses we incur on behalf of the owners.
 
The majority of our management agreements are long-term agreements. In most cases, either party to the agreements may terminate upon the occurrence of an event of default caused by the other party. In addition, in some cases, subject to our rights, if any, to cure deficiencies, community owners may terminate us as manager if any licenses or certificates necessary for operation are revoked, if we do not satisfy certain designated performance thresholds or if the community is sold to an unrelated third party (in which case we may be entitled to receive a contractual termination fee). Also, in some instances, a community owner may terminate the management agreement relating to a particular community if we are in default under other management agreements relating to other communities owned by the same owner or its affiliates. Certain of our management agreements, both with unconsolidated ventures and with entities owned by third parties, provide that an event of default under the debt instruments applicable to the ventures or the entities owned by third parties that is caused by us may also be considered an event of default by us under the relevant management agreement, giving the non-Brookdale party to the management agreement the right to pursue the remedies provided for in the management agreement, potentially including termination of the management agreement. Further, in the event of default on a loan, the lender may have the ability to terminate us as manager. With respect to communities held in unconsolidated ventures, in some cases, the management agreement can be terminated in connection with the sale by the venture partner of its interest in the venture or the sale of properties by the venture.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 50.6% of our management fees revenue was derived from unconsolidated ventures in which HCP owns a controlling interest, and approximately 35.9% of our management fees revenue was derived from our unconsolidated CCRC venture in which we share control with HCP. Early termination or non-renewal of, or renewal on less-favorable terms, of our management agreements (including our management agreements with such unconsolidated ventures) could cause a loss in revenues and could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.
 
As of December 31, 2016, the 153 communities and 26,090 units in our Management Services segment represented 25.3% of our total senior living capacity. As of that date, we operated nine communities, representing 1,070 units, for third parties and 144 communities, representing 25,020 units, for unconsolidated ventures in which we have an ownership interest. As of December 31, 2016, these communities consisted of 36 retirement center communities (7,275 units), 83 assisted living communities (7,791 units) and 34 CCRCs (11,024 units).
 
Competitive Strengths
 
We believe our nationwide network of senior living communities and ancillary services networks are well positioned to benefit from the growth and increasing demand in the industry. Some of our most significant competitive strengths are:

• | Skilled management team with extensive experience. Our senior management team and our Board of Directors have extensive experience in the senior living, healthcare and real estate industries, including the acquisition, operation and management of a broad range of senior living assets.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Geographically diverse, high-quality, purpose-built communities. As of December 31, 2016, we are the largest operator of senior living communities in the United States based on total capacity, with 1,055 communities in 47 states and the ability to serve approximately 103,000 residents.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to provide a broad spectrum of care. Given our diverse mix of retirement centers, assisted living communities and CCRCs, as well as our ancillary services offerings, we are able to meet a wide range of our customers' needs. We believe that we are one of the few companies in the senior living industry with this capability and the only company that does so at scale on a national basis. We believe that our multiple product offerings create marketing synergies and cross-selling opportunities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The size of our business allows us to realize cost and operating efficiencies. The size of our business allows us to realize cost savings and economies of scale in the procurement of goods and services. Our scale also allows us to achieve increased efficiencies with respect to various corporate functions. We intend to utilize our expertise and size to capitalize on economies of scale resulting from our national platform. Our geographic footprint and centralized infrastructure provide us with a significant operational advantage over local and regional operators of senior living communities. In connection with our formation transactions and our acquisitions, we negotiated new contracts for food, insurance and other goods and services. In addition, we have and will continue to consolidate corporate functions such as accounting, finance, human resources, legal, information technology and marketing.

• | Significant experience in providing ancillary services. Through our ancillary services programs, we provide a range of home health, hospice, outpatient therapy, education, wellness and other ancillary services to residents of certain of our communities and to seniors outside our communities. Having therapy clinics located in, and home health agencies that provide services to, our senior living communities is a distinct competitive difference. We have significant experience in providing these ancillary services and expect to receive additional revenues as we expand our ancillary service offerings to additional communities and to seniors outside of our communities.

Segments
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had five reportable segments: Retirement Centers; Assisted Living; CCRCs – Rental; Brookdale Ancillary Services and Management Services. These segments were determined based on the way that our chief operating decision maker organizes our business activities for making operating decisions, assessing performance, developing strategy and allocating capital resources.
 
Operating results from our five business segments are discussed further in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Operations
 
Operations Overview
 
We have implemented intensive standards, policies and procedures and systems, including detailed staff manuals and training materials, which we believe have contributed to high levels of customer service. We have centralized accounting, finance and other operating functions in our support centers so that, consistent with our operating philosophy, community-based personnel can focus on resident care, family connections and efficient operations.  Our operating procedures include securing national vendor contracts to obtain lower pricing for certain services such as food, energy and insurance, implementing effective budgeting and financial controls at each community, and establishing standardized training and operations procedures.  We have also established company-wide policies and procedures relating to, among other things: resident care; community design and community operations; billing and collections; accounts payable; finance and accounting; risk management; development of employee training materials and programs; marketing activities; the hiring and training of management and other community-based personnel; compliance with applicable local and state regulatory requirements; and implementation of our acquisition, development and leasing plans.
Consolidated Corporate Operations Support
 
We have developed a centralized support infrastructure and services platform, which provides us with a significant operational advantage over local and regional operators of senior living communities. The size of our business also allows us to achieve increased efficiencies with respect to various corporate functions such as human resources, finance, accounting, legal, information technology and marketing. We are also able to realize cost efficiencies in the purchasing of food, supplies, insurance, benefits, and other goods and services. In addition, we have established centralized operations groups to support all of our product lines and communities in areas such as training, regulatory affairs, asset management, dining and procurement.
Community Staffing and Training
 
Each community has an Executive Director responsible for the overall day-to-day operations of the community, including quality of care and service, social services and financial performance. Each Executive Director receives specialized training from us. In addition, a portion of each Executive Director's compensation is directly tied to the operating performance of the community and key care and service quality measures.  As part of our refined strategy, we intend to simplify the role of our Executive Directors to allow them to focus on our customers and associates.  We believe that the quality of our communities, coupled with our competitive compensation philosophy, has enabled us to attract high-quality, professional community Executive Directors.
 
Depending upon the size of the community, each Executive Director is supported by a community staff member who is directly responsible for day-to-day care of the residents and either community staff or regional support to oversee the community's sales, marketing and community outreach programs. Other key positions supporting each community may include individuals responsible for food service, healthcare services, therapy services, activities, housekeeping, and engineering.
 
We believe that quality of care and operating efficiency can be maximized by direct resident and staff contact. Employees involved in resident care, including the administrative staff, are trained in the support and care needs of the residents and emergency response techniques. We have adopted formal training and evaluation procedures to help ensure quality care for our residents. We have extensive policy and procedure manuals and hold frequent training sessions for management and staff at each site.
  13
 
Quality Assurance
 
We maintain quality assurance programs at each of our communities through our corporate and regional staff. Our quality assurance programs are designed to achieve a high degree of resident and family member satisfaction with the care and services that we provide. Our quality control measures include, among other things, community inspections conducted by corporate staff on a regular basis. These inspections cover the appearance of the exterior and grounds; the appearance and cleanliness of the interior; the professionalism and friendliness of staff; quality of resident care (including assisted living services, nursing care, therapy and home health programs); the quality of activities and the dining program; observance of residents in their daily living activities; and compliance with government regulations. Our quality control measures also include the survey of residents and family members on a regular basis to monitor their perception of the quality of services provided to residents.
 
In order to foster a sense of community as well as to respond to residents' needs and desires, at many of our communities, we have established a resident council or other resident advisory committee that meets monthly with the Executive Director of the community. Separate resident committees also exist at many of these communities for food service, activities, marketing and hospitality. These committees promote resident involvement and satisfaction and enable community management to be more responsive to the residents' needs and desires.
 
Marketing and Sales
 
Our marketing efforts are intended to create awareness of our Brookdale brand, our communities, our products and our services among potential residents and their family members and among referral sources, including hospital discharge planners, physicians, clergy, area agencies for the elderly, skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies and social workers. Our marketing staff develops overall strategies for promoting our communities and monitors the success of our multi-layered marketing efforts, including outreach programs. In addition to direct contacts with prospective referral sources, we also rely on internet inquiries, contact centers, print advertising, e-mail and digital marketing, social media, direct mail, signage and special events, health fairs and community receptions. Certain resident referral programs have been established and promoted within the limitations of federal and state laws at many communities.
 
As part of our refined strategy, we will continue to leverage our brand recognition while pursuing a multi-layered marketing approach.  We also have designed and begun implementation of a network sales model, have begun to design and implement a new lead management system, and have begun segmenting our communities to align their operating standards with their optimal market position.  With our network sales model, a lead sales associate in many of our markets will be responsible for better coordinating our sales efforts among our communities within a given market.  Our community segmentation efforts are intended to identify optimal levels of price, service offerings, amenities and programs to be offered based on local demand and supply so that we can adjust our operating standards to create differentiated value to meet the needs of our customers.
 
Competition
 
 The senior living industry is highly competitive. We compete with numerous organizations that provide similar senior living alternatives, such as home health care agencies, community-based service programs, retirement communities, convalescent centers and other senior living providers. In addition, over the last several years there has been an increase in the construction of new senior housing assets as the industry has attracted increased investment.  During the year ended December 31, 2016, NIC data shows that industry occupancy began to decrease as a result of new openings, and based on projections of NIC, industry occupancy is expected to be flat through 2017.  During 2016, we experienced an adverse change in the competitive environment for our consolidated senior housing portfolio, with significant new competition opening in a number of our markets. We expect the elevated rate of new openings to continue through most of fiscal 2017.  In general, regulatory and other barriers to competitive entry in the retirement center and assisted living sectors of the senior living industry are not substantial. Consequently, we may encounter competition that could limit our ability to attract residents or expand our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flow. Our major publicly-traded competitors that operate senior living communities are Five Star Quality Care, Inc. and Capital Senior Living Corporation. Our major private competitors include Holiday Retirement, Life Care Services, LLC, and Sunrise Senior Living, LLC, as well as a large number of not-for-profit entities.
 
Although our focus in the near term will be executing on our refined strategy, we plan to continue to evaluate and, where opportunities arise, selectively purchase existing operating companies, senior living communities, including those that we currently lease or manage, and ancillary services companies.  The market for acquiring and/or operating senior living communities is highly competitive, and some of our present and potential senior living competitors have, or may obtain, greater financial resources than us and may have a lower cost of capital. In addition, several publicly-traded and non-traded real estate investment trusts, or REITs, and private equity firms have similar asset acquisition objectives as we do, along with greater financial resources and/or lower costs of capital than we are able to obtain. Partially as a result of tax law changes enacted through RIDEA, we now compete more directly with the various publicly-traded healthcare REITs for the acquisition of senior housing properties. The largest three of these publicly-traded healthcare REITs measured on equity market capitalization include HCP, Inc., Ventas, Inc. and Welltower, Inc.

Customers
 
Our target retirement center residents are senior citizens age 75 and older who desire or need a more supportive living environment. A number of our retirement center residents relocate to one of our communities in order to be in a metropolitan area that is closer to their adult children.
 
Our target assisted living residents are predominantly senior citizens age 80 and older who require daily assistance with two or more ADLs. Residents typically enter an assisted living community due to a relatively immediate need for services that might have been triggered by a medical event or need.
 
Our target CCRC residents are senior citizens who are seeking a community that offers a variety of services and a continuum of care so that they can "age-in-place." These residents generally first enter the community as a resident of an independent living unit and may later move into an assisted living or skilled nursing area as their needs change.
 
Seasonality
 
Our seniors housing business has typically experienced some seasonality, which we experience in certain regions more than others, due to weather patterns, geography and higher incidence and severity of illnesses during winter months.  Although our seasonal pattern varies from year to year, our average monthly occupancy generally begins to decline sequentially during the fourth quarter of the year, and we generally expect average monthly occupancy to begin to increase during the second quarter each year.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 50,100 full-time employees and approximately 27,500 part-time employees, of which 615 work in our Brentwood, Tennessee (a suburb of Nashville) headquarters office, 638 work in our Milwaukee, Wisconsin office and 1,033 work in our smaller regional support offices and a variety of field-based management positions. We currently consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Government Regulation
 
The regulatory environment surrounding the senior living industry continues to intensify in the number and type of laws and regulations affecting it. In addition, federal, state and local officials are increasingly focusing their efforts on enforcement of these laws and regulations. This is particularly true for large for-profit, multi-community providers like us. Some of the laws and regulations that impact our industry include: state and local laws impacting licensure, protecting consumers against deceptive practices, and generally affecting the communities' management of property and equipment and how we otherwise conduct our operations, such as fire, health and safety laws and regulations and privacy laws; federal and state laws designed to protect Medicare and Medicaid, which mandate what are allowable costs, pricing, quality of services, quality of care, food service, resident rights (including abuse and neglect) and fraud; federal and state residents' rights statutes and regulations; Anti-Kickback and physicians referral ("Stark") laws; and safety and health standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. We are unable to predict the future course of federal, state and local legislation or regulation. Changes in the regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Many senior living communities are also subject to regulation and licensing by state and local health and social service agencies and other regulatory authorities. Although requirements vary from state to state, these requirements may address, among others, the following: personnel education, training and records; community services, including administration of medication, assistance with self-administration of medication and the provision of nursing, home health and therapy services; staffing levels; monitoring of resident wellness; physical plant specifications; furnishing of resident units; food and housekeeping services; emergency evacuation plans; professional licensing and certification of staff prior to beginning employment; and resident rights and responsibilities, including in some states the right to receive health care services from providers of a resident's choice that are not our employees. In several of the states in which we operate or may operate, we are prohibited from providing certain higher levels of senior care services without first obtaining the appropriate licenses. In addition, in several of the states in which we operate or intend to operate, assisted living communities, home health agencies and/or skilled nursing facilities require a certificate of need before the community can be opened or the services at an existing community can be expanded. Senior living communities may also be subject to state and/or local building, zoning, fire and food service codes and must be in compliance with these local codes before licensing or certification may be granted. These laws and regulatory requirements could affect our ability to expand into new markets and to expand our services and communities in existing markets. In addition, if any of our presently licensed communities operates outside of its licensing authority, it may be subject to penalties, including closure of the community.
  15
 
The intensified regulatory and enforcement environment impacts providers like us because of the increase in the number of inspections or surveys by governmental authorities and consequent citations for failure to comply with regulatory requirements. Unannounced surveys or inspections may occur annually or bi-annually, or following a regulator's receipt of a complaint about the community. From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we receive deficiency reports from state regulatory bodies resulting from such inspections or surveys. Most inspection deficiencies are resolved through an agreed-to plan of corrective action relating to the community's operations, but the reviewing agency typically has the authority to take further action against a licensed or certified community, which could result in the imposition of fines, imposition of a provisional or conditional license, suspension or revocation of a license, suspension or denial of admissions, loss of certification as a provider under federal health care programs or imposition of other sanctions, including criminal penalties. Loss, suspension or modification of a license may also cause us to default under our loan or lease agreements and/or trigger cross-defaults. Sanctions may be taken against providers or facilities without regard to the providers' or facilities' history of compliance. We may also expend considerable resources to respond to federal and state investigations or other enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations. To date, none of the deficiency reports received by us has resulted in a suspension, fine or other disposition that has had a material adverse effect on our revenues. However, any future substantial failure to comply with any applicable legal and regulatory requirements could result in a material adverse effect to our business as a whole. In addition, states Attorneys General vigorously enforce consumer protection laws as those laws relate to the senior living industry. State Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Units may also investigate assisted living communities even if the community or any of its residents do not receive federal or state funds.
 
Regulation of the senior living industry is evolving at least partly because of the growing interests of a variety of advocacy organizations and political movements attempting to standardize regulations for certain segments of the industry, particularly assisted living. Our operations could suffer if future regulatory developments, such as federal assisted living laws and regulations, as well as mandatory increases in the scope and severity of deficiencies determined by survey or inspection officials or increase the number of citations that can result in civil or criminal penalties. Certain current state laws and regulations allow enforcement officials to make determinations on whether the care provided by one or more of our communities exceeds the level of care for which the community is licensed. A finding that a community is delivering care beyond its license might result in the immediate transfer and discharge of residents, which may create market instability and other adverse consequences. Furthermore, certain states may allow citations in one community to impact other communities in the state. Revocation or suspension of a license, or a citation, at a given community could therefore impact our ability to obtain new licenses or to renew existing licenses at other communities, which may also cause us to be in default under our loan or lease agreements and trigger cross-defaults or may also trigger defaults under certain of our credit agreements, or adversely affect our ability to operate and/or obtain financing in the future. If a state were to find that one community's citation will impact another of our communities, this will also increase costs and result in increased surveillance by the state survey agency. If regulatory requirements increase, whether through enactment of new laws or regulations or changes in the enforcement of existing rules, including increased enforcement brought about by advocacy groups, in addition to federal and state regulators, our operations could be adversely affected. In addition, any adverse finding by survey and inspection officials may serve as the basis for false claims lawsuits by private plaintiffs and may lead to investigations under federal and state laws, which may result in civil and/or criminal penalties against the community or individual.
 
There are various extremely complex federal and state laws governing a wide array of referrals, relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraud by health care providers, including those in the senior living industry, and governmental agencies are devoting increasing attention and resources to such anti-fraud initiatives. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 expanded the penalties for health care fraud. In addition, with respect to our participation in federal health care reimbursement programs, the government or private individuals acting on behalf of the government may bring an action under the False Claims Act alleging that a health care provider has defrauded the government and seek treble damages for false claims and the payment of additional monetary civil penalties. Recently, other health care providers have faced enforcement action under the False Claims Act. The False Claims Act allows a private individual with knowledge of fraud to bring a claim on behalf of the federal government and earn a percentage of the federal government's recovery. Because of these incentives, so-called "whistleblower" suits have become more frequent. Also, if any of our communities exceeds its level of care, we may be subject to private lawsuits alleging "transfer trauma" by residents. Such allegations could also lead to investigations by enforcement officials, which could result in penalties, including the closure of communities. The violation of any of these regulations may result in the imposition of fines or other penalties that could jeopardize our business.
 
Additionally, we operate communities that participate in federal and/or state health care reimbursement programs, including state Medicaid waiver programs for assisted living communities, the Medicare skilled nursing facility benefit program and other healthcare programs such as therapy and home health services, or other federal and/or state health care programs. Consequently, we are subject to federal and state laws that prohibit anyone from presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for reimbursement which are false, fraudulent or are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. Similar state laws vary from state to state and we cannot be sure that these laws will be interpreted consistently or in keeping with past practices. Violation of any of these laws can result in loss of licensure, claims for recoupment, civil or criminal penalties and exclusion of health care providers or suppliers from furnishing covered items or services to beneficiaries of the applicable federal and/or state health care reimbursement program. Loss of licensure may also cause us to default under our leases and loan agreements and/or trigger cross-defaults.
  16
 
We are also subject to certain federal and state laws that regulate financial arrangements by health care providers, such as the Federal Anti-Kickback Law, the Stark laws and certain state referral laws. The Federal Anti-Kickback Law makes it unlawful for any person to offer or pay (or to solicit or receive) "any remuneration ... directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind" for referring or recommending for purchase any item or service which is eligible for payment under the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs. Authorities have interpreted this statute very broadly to apply to many practices and relationships between health care providers and sources of patient referral. If we were to violate the Federal Anti-Kickback Law, we may face criminal penalties and civil sanctions, including fines and possible exclusion from government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, which may also cause us to default under our leases and loan agreements and/or trigger cross-defaults. Adverse consequences may also result if we violate federal Stark laws related to certain Medicare and Medicaid physician referrals. While we endeavor to comply with all laws that regulate the licensure and operation of our senior living communities, it is difficult to predict how our revenues could be affected if we were subject to an action alleging such violations. We are also subject to federal and state laws designed to protect the confidentiality of patient health information. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has issued rules pursuant to HIPAA relating to the privacy of such information. Rules that became effective April 14, 2003 govern our use and disclosure of health information at certain HIPAA covered communities. We established procedures to comply with HIPAA privacy requirements at these communities. We were required to be in compliance with the HIPAA rule establishing administrative, physical and technical security standards for health information by April 2005. To the best of our knowledge, we are in compliance with these rules.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real property, such as us, may be held liable in certain circumstances for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances, including, among others, petroleum and materials containing asbestos, that could be located on, in, at or under a property, regardless of how such materials came to be located there. Additionally, such an owner or operator of real property may incur costs relating to the release of hazardous or toxic substances, including government fines and payments for personal injuries or damage to adjacent property. The cost of any required investigation, remediation, removal, mitigation, compliance, fines or personal or property damages and our liability therefore could exceed the property's value and/or our assets' value. In addition, the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate the damage caused by such substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell such property, to attract additional residents and retain existing residents, to borrow using such property as collateral or to develop or redevelop such property. In addition, such laws impose liability for investigation, remediation, removal and mitigation costs on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at third-party sites. Such laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence, release or disposal of such substances as well as without regard to whether such release or disposal was in compliance with law at the time it occurred. Moreover, the imposition of such liability upon us could be joint and several, which means we could be required to pay for the cost of cleaning up contamination caused by others who have become insolvent or otherwise judgment proof.
 
We do not believe that we have incurred such liabilities that would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Our operations are subject to regulation under various federal, state and local environmental laws, including those relating to: the handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of medical waste products generated at our communities; identification and warning of the presence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings, as well as removal of such materials; the presence of other substances in the indoor environment; and protection of the environment and natural resources in connection with development or construction of our properties.
 
Some of our communities generate infectious or other hazardous medical waste due to the illness or physical condition of the residents, including, for example, blood-contaminated bandages, swabs and other medical waste products and incontinence products of those residents diagnosed with an infectious disease. The management of infectious medical waste, including its handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal, is subject to regulation under various federal, state and local environmental laws. These environmental laws set forth the management requirements for such waste, as well as related permit, record-keeping, notice and reporting obligations. Each of our communities has an agreement with a waste management company for the proper disposal of all infectious medical waste. The use of such waste management companies does not immunize us from alleged violations of such medical waste laws for operations for which we are responsible even if carried out by such waste management companies, nor does it immunize us from third-party claims for the cost to cleanup disposal sites at which such wastes have been disposed. Any finding that we are not in compliance with environmental laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

Federal regulations require building owners and those exercising control over a building's management to identify and warn, via signs and labels, their employees and certain other employers operating in the building of potential hazards posed by workplace exposure to installed asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials in their buildings. The regulations also set forth employee training, record-keeping requirements and sampling protocols pertaining to asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials. Significant fines can be assessed for violation of these regulations. Building owners and those exercising control over a building's management may be subject to an increased risk of personal injury lawsuits by workers and others exposed to asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials. The regulations may affect the value of a building containing asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials in which we have invested. Federal, state and local laws and regulations also govern the removal, encapsulation, disturbance, handling and/or disposal of asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction, remodeling, renovation or demolition of a building. Such laws may impose liability for improper handling or a release to the environment of asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials and may provide for fines to, and for third parties to seek recovery from, owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or improper work exposure associated with asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials.
 
The presence of mold, lead-based paint, contaminants in drinking water, radon and/or other substances at any of the communities we own or may acquire may lead to the incurrence of costs for remediation, mitigation or the implementation of an operations and maintenance plan. Furthermore, the presence of mold, lead-based paint, contaminants in drinking water, radon and/or other substances at any of the communities we own or may acquire may present a risk that third parties will seek recovery from the owners, operators or tenants of such properties for personal injury or property damage. In some circumstances, areas affected by mold may be unusable for periods of time for repairs, and even after successful remediation, the known prior presence of extensive mold could adversely affect the ability of a community to retain or attract residents and could adversely affect a community's market value.
 
We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws.
 
We are unable to predict the future course of federal, state and local environmental regulation and legislation. Changes in the environmental regulatory framework (including legislative or regulatory efforts designed to address climate change, such as the proposed "cap and trade" legislation) could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, because environmental laws vary from state to state, expansion of our operations to states where we do not currently operate may subject us to additional restrictions on the manner in which we operate our communities.
