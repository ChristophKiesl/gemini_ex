Overview
 SPS Commerce is a leading provider of cloud-based supply chain management services that make it easier for retailers, suppliers, grocers, distributors, and logistics firms to orchestrate the management of item data, order fulfillment, inventory control, and sales analytics across all channels. Implementing and maintaining a suite of supply chain management capabilities is resource-intensive and is not a core competency for most businesses. 
 The services offered by SPS Commerce eliminate the need for on-premise software and support staff by taking on that capability on the customer’s behalf. The services SPS Commerce provides enable our customers to increase their supply cycle agility, optimize their inventory levels and sell-through, reduce operational costs and gain increased visibility into customer orders, ensuring that suppliers, grocers, distributors, and logistics firms can satisfy exacting retailer requirements. 
 As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 33,000 customers with contracts to pay us monthly fees, which we refer to as recurring revenue customers. We have also generated revenues by providing our cloud-based supply chain management services to an additional 62,000 organizations that, together with our recurring revenue customers, we refer to as our customers. Once connected to the SPS Commerce cloud-based Platform, our customers often require integrations to new organizations that represent an expansion of our cloud-based Platform and new sources of revenues for us.
 For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we generated revenues of $312.6 million, $279.1 million, and $248.2 million, respectively. Our quarter ended December 31, 2020 represented our 80th consecutive quarter of increased revenues. Recurring revenues from recurring revenue customers accounted for 94%, 94% and 93% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Our revenues are not concentrated with any customer, as our largest customer represented less than 1% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.
 Our Solutions 
 SPS Commerce operates one of the largest retail trading partner networks in the world through cloud-based services that improve the way retailers, suppliers, grocers, distributors, and logistics firms manage and fulfill orders, administer sell-through performance, and source new items. Approximately 95,000 customers across approximately 80 countries are using SPS Commerce solutions to expand and optimize the performance of their trading relationships.
 The SPS Commerce business model fundamentally changes how organizations use electronic communication to manage their omnichannel, supply chain, and other business requirements by replacing the collection of traditional, custom-built, point-to-point integrations with a model that facilitates a single automated connection to the entire SPS Commerce network of trading partners.
 From that single connection, a member of our network can make use of the full suite of our services, from fulfillment automation to the analysis and optimization of item sell-through performance, to sourcing new items, retailing relationships, logistics providers, or other services. These cloud services deliver value as stand-alone offerings but can also provide greater value when used collectively. This represents a fundamental change to fulfillment automation and enables inherent adaptability and flexibility not possible with traditional supply chain management system architectures.
 Our Fulfillment solution allows customers to comply with numerous rulebooks for retailers, grocers, and distributors. Maintaining current connections with retailers, grocers, and distributors removes the need for their trading partners to continually stay up-to-date with their required rulebook change. The utilization of a cloud services model eliminates (or greatly reduces) the burden on trading partners to support and maintain an on-premise software application, thereby reducing their ongoing operating costs. As the transaction hub for trading partners, we can provide increased performance visibility and data analytics capabilities across their supply chains, each of which is difficult to gain from traditional, point-to-point integration solutions.

The following services are enabled through the SPS Commerce cloud-based Platform:
  
• | Fulfillment. The Fulfillment solution provides fulfillment automation and replaces or augments an organization’s existing staff and trading partner electronic communication infrastructure by enabling easy compliance with retailers’ rulebooks, automatic, digital exchange of information among numerous trading partners through various protocols, and greater visibility into the journey of an order.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Analytics. The Analytics solution consists of data analytics applications that enable our customers to improve their visibility across their supply chains through greater analytics capabilities. When focused on point-of-sale data, for example, retailers and suppliers can ensure inventory is located where demand is highest. Additionally, retailers improve their visibility into supplier performance and their understanding of product sell-through.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other Solutions. We provide several peripheral solutions, such as our assortment solution (which enables accurate order management and rapid fulfillment) and our community solution (which accelerates vendor onboarding and ensures trading partner adoption of new supply chain requirements).

Our Customer and Sales Sources
 As one of the largest providers of cloud services for retail supply chain management, the trading partner relationships that we enable among our retailer, supplier, grocer, distributor, and logistics customers naturally lead to new customer acquisition opportunities.
“Network Effect”
 Once connected to our network, trading partners can exchange electronic supply chain information with each other. The value of our network increases with the number of trading partners connected to it. The addition of each new customer enables that new customer to communicate with our existing customers and permits our existing customers to do business with the new customer. Additionally, through our Sourcing solution, our community now has a social network focused on facilitating connections and business interactions among retailers and suppliers. This “network effect” of adding additional customers to our solutions’ infrastructure creates a significant opportunity for existing customers to realize incremental sales by working with our new trading partners and vice versa. As a result of this increased volume of activity among our network participants, we earn additional revenues from these participants.
 Business Development Efforts. 
 Our business development organization is tasked with finding new sources of revenue and the development of new business opportunities through channel partners and other areas that present an opportunity for growth.
Customer Acquisition Sources
 Community. As retailers and suppliers reshape how they do business in an omnichannel landscape, they need to bring new capabilities and services to their trading partner networks. For instance, a supplier may wish to collaborate with their retailers around point-of-sale analytics data, or a retailer may decide to change the workflow or protocol by which it interacts with its suppliers. In each case, the supplier and retailer may engage us to work with its trading partner base to enable the new capability. Performing these programs on behalf of retailers and suppliers often generates supplier sales leads for us.
 Referrals from Our Customers. We also receive sales leads from our customers seeking to communicate electronically with their trading partners. For example, a supplier may refer its third-party logistics provider or manufacturer, which is not in our network, to us.
 Direct Marketing. We employ various marketing strategies. Our marketing program include a variety of lead generating activities including digital marketing, advertising, conferences and tradeshows, events, and public relations activities targeted at key decision makers within our prospective customers.

-------------------+---+--------------------------------------------------------

Channel Partners. In addition to the customer acquisition sources identified above, we market and sell our solutions through a variety of channel partners, including software providers, resellers, system integrators, and logistics partners. For example, software partners such as Microsoft, NetSuite, Oracle, SAP, Sage, and their business partner communities generate sales for us as part of broader enterprise resource planning, warehouse management system and/or transportation management system sales efforts. Our logistics partners also drive new sales both by providing leads and by embedding our solutions as part of their service offerings.
Our Sales Force
 We sell our solutions through a global sales force which is organized as follows:
  
• | Retailer Sales. We employ a team of sales representatives who focus on selling our cloud services suite to retailers and distributors.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Supplier Sales. We employ a team of supplier sales representatives focused on selling our cloud services suite to suppliers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other. We employ a team of sales representatives targeting a broad range of potential customer types such as those in logistics, distribution, ecommerce, and other areas.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Growth Strategy
 Our objective is to be the leading global provider of supply chain management solutions. Key elements of our strategy include:
  
• | Further Penetrate Our Current Market. We believe the global supply chain management market is underpenetrated and, as the retail industry continues to respond to the changing requirements of the omnichannel marketplace, and as the supply chain ecosystem becomes more complex and geographically dispersed, the demand for supply chain management solutions will increase, especially among small- and medium-sized businesses. We intend to continue leveraging our relationships with customers and their trading partners to obtain new sales leads.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increase Revenues from Our Customer Base. We believe our overall customer satisfaction is strong and will lead our customers to further expand their use of the solutions they have purchased, as well as purchase additional services to continue improving the performance of their trading partner relationships, generating additional revenues for us. We also expect to introduce new solutions to sell to our customers. We believe our position as the incumbent supply chain management solution provider to our customers, our integration into our recurring revenue customers’ business systems, and the modular nature of our cloud-based Platform are conducive to deploying additional solutions with customers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand Our Distribution Channels. We intend to grow our business by expanding our sales capacity to gain new customers. We also believe there are valuable opportunities to promote and sell our solutions through collaboration with other providers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand Our International Presence. We believe our presence in Asia Pacific, as well as in Europe, represents a significant competitive advantage. We plan to increase our global sales efforts to obtain new customers around the world. We intend to leverage our current global presence to increase the number of integrations we have with retailers in foreign markets to make our solutions more valuable to their trading partners based overseas.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhance and Expand Our Services. We intend to further improve and develop the functionality and features of our cloud-based Platform, including, from time to time, developing new solutions and applications.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. The fragmented nature of our market provides an opportunity for selective acquisitions. We plan to evaluate potential acquisitions based on the number of new customers, revenue, functionality, or geographic reach the acquisition would provide relative to the purchase price and our ability to integrate and operate the acquired business. In 2020, we acquired D Masons Software, LLC (“Data Masons”), a leading provider of electronic data interchange (“EDI”)

Technology, Development and Operations
 Technology
 SPS Commerce was an early provider of cloud services to the retail supply chain management industry, launching the first version of what would become our current services in 1997. We use commercially available hardware and cloud services with a combination of proprietary and commercially available software.
 Our cloud service model treats all customers as logically separate tenants within a shared virtual infrastructure. As a result, we spread the cost of delivering our solutions across our customer base. Because we do not manage thousands of distinct applications with their own business logic and database schemes, we believe that we can scale our business faster than traditional software vendors, even those that modified their products to be accessible over the Internet.
 Development
 Our research and development efforts focus on maintaining, improving, and enhancing our existing solutions, as well as developing new solutions and applications. Our multi-tenant solutions serve all of our customers, which allows us to maintain relatively low research and development expenses and release software updates more frequently compared to traditional on-premise licensed software solutions that support multiple versions. Our development efforts take place at our U.S. locations in Minnesota and New Jersey, as well as in Melbourne, Australia; Toronto, Canada; and Kyiv, Ukraine.
Operations
 We operate our infrastructure in third-party data centers located in Minnesota, New Jersey, Texas, Florida, and Melbourne, Australia, as well as provisioned services in cloud providers. In most cases, infrastructure and services are managed by us.
 We have internal and third-party monitoring software that continually checks our cloud-based Platform and key underlying components for continuous availability and performance, helping ensure that the network is always available and providing desired service levels. We have a technology engineering team that includes system provisioning, management, maintenance, monitoring, and back-up.
 We operate a service architecture using industry best practices to ensure multiple points of redundancy, high availability, and scale as needed. Our databases are replicated between locations with a defined recovery point objective.
 Our Customers
 As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 33,000 recurring revenue customers and approximately 95,000 total customers. Our primary source of revenue is from small- to mid-sized suppliers. We also generate revenues from other members of the supply chain ecosystem, including retailers, distributors, third-party logistics providers, and other trading partners. Our revenues are not concentrated with any customer, as our largest customer represented less than 1% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.

Competition
 Vendors in the supply chain management industry offer solutions through three delivery methods: traditional on-premise software, cloud-based managed services, and cloud-based full-service solutions.
 The market for cloud-based supply chain management solutions is fragmented and rapidly evolving. Cloud service vendors compete directly with each other based mainly on the following:

• | the breadth of pre-built connections to retailers, third-party logistics providers, and other trading partners;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a history of establishing and maintaining reliable connections with trading partners;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a reputation of the cloud service vendor in the supply chain management industry;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | price;
--+-------


• | specialization in a customer market segment;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | speed and quality with which the cloud service vendor can integrate its customers to their trading partners;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | functionality of the cloud service solution, such as the ability to integrate the solution with a customer’s business systems;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | breadth of complementary supply chain management solutions the cloud service vendor offers; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | training and customer support services provided during and after a customer’s initial integration.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We expect to encounter new and increased competition as this market segment consolidates and matures. Consolidation among cloud service vendors could create a direct competitor that can compete with us more effectively than the numerous, smaller vendors currently offering cloud service supply chain management solutions. Increased competition from cloud service vendors could reduce our market share, revenues, and operating margins or otherwise adversely affect our business.
 Cloud service vendors also compete with traditional on-premise software companies. Traditional on-premise software companies focused on supply chain integration management include IBM Sterling Commerce and OpenText. These companies offer a “do-it-yourself” method in which customers purchase, install, and manage specialized software, hardware, and value-added networks for their supply chain integration needs. This method requires customers to invest in staff to operate and maintain the software. Traditional on-premise software companies use a single-tenant approach in which information maps to retailers are built for and used by one supplier, as compared to cloud service solutions that allow multiple customers to share information maps with a retailer.
 Managed service providers focused on the supply chain management market include IBM Sterling Commerce, OpenText, TrueCommerce/B2B Gateway, DiCentral, and many other small providers. These companies offer a cloud-based solution in which they develop and maintain the core technology, while the customer’s internal staff is responsible for the day-to-day customization, optimization, and operations of the technology.
In contrast, full-service providers, including SPS Commerce, offer cloud-based solutions that customize, optimize, and operate the technology. This approach offloads the time-intensive process of managing these solutions, which is not a core competency for most businesses. 
 Customers of traditional on-premise software providers must typically make significant upfront investments in the supply chain management solutions these competitors provide, which can decrease the customers’ willingness to abandon their investments in favor of a cloud service solution. Cloud service vendors compete with these traditional software solutions based on the total cost of ownership and flexibility. 
 Intellectual Property and Proprietary Content
 SPS Commerce relies on a combination of copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We enter 

SPS COMMERCE, INC. | 8 | Form 10-K for the Annual Period ended December 31, 2020
-------------------+---+--------------------------------------------------------

 

into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and additional third parties, and control access to software, documentation, and other proprietary information. We have registered trademarks and pending trademark applications in the U.S. and certain foreign countries. 
 Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use or their registrations are properly maintained, and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. We do not have any patents, but we have pending patent applications. Our trade secrets consist primarily of the software we have developed for our SPS Commerce cloud-based Platform and network. Our software is also protected under copyright law, but we do not have any registered copyrights.
 Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,572 employees, including 737 in cost of revenues based functional areas, 417 in sales and marketing, 281 in research and development and 137 in general and administrative functions. We also employ independent contractors to support our operations. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. 
 We believe our employees have and will continue to be a primary reason for our growth and success. We offer competitive benefits as well as training, development, review, and feedback programs to develop employees’ expertise and skillsets, as well as strive to provide a safe, harassment-free work environment guided by principles of fair and equal treatment and prioritize employee engagement. As a result, we believe our employees are committed to building strong, innovative, and long-term relationships with each other and our organization in order to succeed together and with our customers. We offer our employees pay and benefits packages, which we believe are competitive with others throughout our industry, as well as within the local markets in which we operate, and aligns individual performance with our success. The health of our employees is also very important to us. In response to the threats of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have, where possible, offered remote work flexibility beginning in March 2020 which has continued through December 2020, without significant impacts to productivity.
