Business 
 General 
 The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (“Boston Beer” or the “Company”) is a high-end alcoholic beverage company and one of the largest craft brewers in the United States. In fiscal 2020, Boston Beer sold approximately 7.4 million barrels of its proprietary products. The Company’s brands include Truly Hard Seltzer®, Twisted Tea®, Samuel Adams®, Angry Orchard® Hard Cider and Dogfish Head® Craft Brewery, as well as other local craft beer brands. 
 Boston Beer produces alcohol beverages, including hard seltzer, malt beverages (“beers”), and hard cider at Company-owned breweries and its cidery and under contract arrangements at other brewery locations. The four primary Company-owned breweries are focused on production and research and development and include breweries located in Boston, Massachusetts (the “Boston Brewery”), Cincinnati, Ohio (the “Cincinnati Brewery”), Milton, Delaware (the “Milton Brewery”) and Breinigsville, Pennsylvania (the “Pennsylvania Brewery”). These breweries, with the exception of the Pennsylvania Brewery, have tap rooms for retail sales on site. The Company produces a small amount of distilled spirits at the Milton Brewery. 
 The Company also owns five smaller local breweries that are mainly focused on brewing and packaging beers for retail sales on site at tap rooms and gift shops, restaurant activities, developing innovative and traditional beers and in some cases, supporting draft and package accounts in the respective local market areas. These local breweries are located in Boston, Massachusetts (the “Samuel Adams Boston Downtown Tap Room”), Rehoboth, Delaware (“Dogfish Head Brewings and Eats”), Los Angeles, California (the “Angel City Brewery”), Brooklyn, New York (the “Coney Island Brewery”) and Miami, Florida (the “Miami Brewery”). 
 In addition, the Company owns an apple orchard and cidery located in Walden, New York (the “Orchard” and “Cidery”), a restaurant in Rehoboth, Delaware (“Chesapeake & Maine”) and a boutique inn in Lewes, Delaware (the “Dogfish Inn”). 
 The Company sells its beverages in various packages. Sleek cans, standard cans and bottles are sold primarily for off-premise retailers, which include grocery stores, club stores, convenience stores and liquor stores. Kegs are sold primarily for on-premise retailers, which include bars, restaurants, stadiums and other venues. 
 The Company’s principal executive offices are located at One Design Center Place, Suite 850, Boston, Massachusetts 02210, and its telephone number is (617) 368-5000. 
 Industry Background 
 
Most of the Company’s products are sold through off-premise retailers and the Company estimates the size of its markets using metrics from measured off-premise channels, which is standard in the beer industry.  The Company’s hard seltzers, beers, and hard ciders are primarily positioned in the market for High End beer occasions.  The Company defines “High End” beers as including hard seltzer and flavored malt beverages, craft beers, domestic specialty beers, and most imported beer and hard cider that are called for by a High End beer drinker occasion.  High End beers and beer occasions (the “High End category”) are determined by higher price, quality, image and taste, as compared with regular domestic beers. 
 
This category has seen high single-digit compounded annual growth over the past ten years.  The Company believes that the High End category is positioned to increase market share, as drinkers continue to trade up in taste and quality.  Boston Beer is one of the largest suppliers in the High End category in the United States.  The Company estimates that in 2020 the High End category percentage volume growth was approximately 25%, with the craft beer category volume growth approximately 13%, and total beer category volume growth approximately 10%.  The Company believes that the High End category is now over 36% of the United States beer market and the Company has approximately a 9% market share of the High End category. 
 
The domestic beer industry, excluding the High End category, has experienced a decline in shipment volume over the last twenty years.  The Company believes that this decline is due to declining alcohol consumption per person in the population, drinkers trading up to drink high quality, more flavorful beers, health and wellness trends and increased competition from wine and spirits companies.
 Before Prohibition, the United States beer industry consisted of hundreds of small breweries that brewed full-flavored beers. After the end of Prohibition, most domestic brewers shifted production to less flavorful, lighter beers, which use lower-cost ingredients, and can be mass-produced to take advantage of economies of scale in production. This shift towards mass-

produced beers coincided with consolidation in the beer industry that by 2008 ultimately resulted in the two largest breweries, Anheuser-Busch InBev (“AB InBev”) and Molson Coors Beverage Company (“Molson Coors”), comprising over 90% of all United States domestic beer production, excluding imports. During the last twenty years the number of breweries in the United States has increased significantly from approximately 1,500 in 2009 to over 8,000 in 2020. Most of these new breweries are craft (small and independent) brewers. The rise of craft breweries along with the growth of imported beers and hard seltzers has resulted in a significant decline in the volume of the two largest breweries who now comprise approximately 70% of all United States domestic beer production, excluding imports. 
 Description of the Company’s Business 
 The Company’s business goal is to become the leading supplier in the High End category by creating and offering high quality alcohol beverages. With the support of a large, well-trained sales organization and world-class brewers, the Company strives to achieve this goal by offering great hard seltzers, beers and hard ciders, and increasing brand availability and awareness through traditional media and digital advertising, point-of-sale, promotional programs and drinker education. 
 The Company’s hard seltzers, beers and hard cider are sold by the Company’s sales force to the same types of customers and drinkers in similar size quantities, at similar price points and through substantially the same channels of distribution. These beverages are manufactured using similar production processes, have comparable alcohol content and generally fall within the same regulatory environment. 
 The Company’s strategy is to create and offer a world-class variety of traditional and innovative alcohol beverages. The Company’s primary brands which include Truly Hard Seltzer, Twisted Tea, Samuel Adams, Angry Orchard and Dogfish Head brands are all available nationally. In 2016, the Company began national distribution of the Truly Hard Seltzer brand and it maintained its place as one of the leading brands in the hard seltzer category in 2020. The Twisted Tea brand family has grown each year since the product was first introduced in 2001 and has established a loyal drinker following. The Samuel Adams brand began in 1984 and the brand is recognized as one of the largest and most respected craft beer brands with a particular focus on lagers and seasonal beers. The Angry Orchard brand was launched in 2011 and since 2013, Angry Orchard has been the largest selling hard cider in the United States. The Dogfish Head brand began in 1995 and is recognized as one of the most innovative and respected craft beer brands with a particular focus on India Pale Ales (“IPAs”) and sour beers. In addition to its primary brands the Company has three local brewery brands that primarily focus on tap rooms and local and regional distribution, which include Angel City®, Coney Island® and Concrete Beach®. 
 The Company sells its beverages in various packages. Sleek cans, standard cans and bottles are sold primarily for off-premise retailers, which include grocery stores, club stores, convenience stores and liquor stores. Kegs are sold primarily for on-premise retailers, which include bars, restaurants, stadiums and other venues. 
 Truly Hard Seltzer
 
The Company’s Truly Hard Seltzer brand generally competes within the hard seltzer category that has similar characteristics to the beer industry for reporting and regulatory purposes.  This category is growing rapidly in its early stages of development over the last 5 years and is highly competitive and includes large international and domestic competitors as well as many smaller national, regional and local craft breweries and hard seltzer companies.  The Company believes that the hard seltzer category comprises approximately 7% of United States beer consumption and that the volume comprising the hard seltzer category grew approximately 160% in 2020.
 The Company offers seventeen styles of hard seltzer in the Truly brand family, most of which are available nationally in the United States. The majority of the promotional and distribution efforts for the Truly brand family are focused on sleek can variety packages which include Truly Lemonade Seltzer Mix Pack, Truly Berry Mix Pack, Truly Tropical Mix Pack, Truly Citrus Mix Pack and Truly Tea Seltzer Mix Pack.
 Twisted Tea
 The Company’s Twisted Tea products generally competes within the flavored malt beverage (“FMB”) category of the beer industry (and the Company’s Twisted Tea products are included in generic references to the Company’s “beers” in this report). The Company believes that the FMB category comprises approximately 5% of United States beer consumption and that the volume comprising the FMB category grew approximately 13% in 2020. This category is highly competitive due to, among other factors, the presence of large brewers and spirits companies in the category and a fast pace of product innovation. 
 4


The Company offers over ten styles of flavored malt beverages in the Twisted Tea brand family, most of which are available nationally in both the United States and Canada. The majority of the promotional and distribution efforts for the Twisted Tea brand family are focused on Twisted Tea Original and Twisted Tea Half and Half in various standard can packages. 
 Samuel Adams and Dogfish Head Beers
 The Company’s Samuel Adams and Dogfish Head beers generally compete within the craft beer and domestic specialty beer category.  The Company believes that the category comprises approximately 8% of United States beer consumption and that the volume comprising the category grew approximately 13% in 2020. This category is highly competitive and includes large international and domestic competitors, as well as many smaller national, regional and local craft breweries.
 The Company offers over twenty styles of beer in the Samuel Adams brand family and the brand is recognized for helping launch the craft beer industry. Samuel Adams Boston Lager® is the Company’s flagship beer that was first introduced in 1984. The Samuel Adams Seasonal program of beers was originally introduced in the late 1980’s and early 1990’s. 
 The majority of the promotional and distribution efforts for the Samuel Adams brand family are focused on Samuel Adams Boston Lager and the Samuel Adams Seasonal program of beers in various bottle, standard can and keg packages. 
 The Samuel Adams brand also releases a variety of specialty package and draft beers brewed in limited quantities at its Samuel Adams Downtown Boston Tap Room, Samuel Adams Boston Brewery Tap Room and Samuel Adams Cincinnati Brewery Tap Room. 
 The Company offers over twenty-five styles of beer in the Dogfish Head brand family. The Dogfish Head brand began in 1993 and it is recognized as an early leader in bringing culinary innovations to the U.S. craft beer market. The majority of the promotional and distribution efforts for the Dogfish Head brand family are focused on continually-hopped Dogfish Head 60 Minute and 90 Minute IPAs, along with Dogfish Head SeaQuench, an innovative session sour, and Dogfish Head Slightly Mighty, a low calorie IPA. These four styles are offered in various can, bottle and keg packages. The Company also offers over 15 styles of distilled spirits under the Dogfish Head brand in small quantities and to limited markets. The Dogfish Head brand also releases a variety of specialty package and draft beers brewed in limited quantities at its Dogfish Head Brewings and Eats brewery.  The Company does not own distribution rights to the Dogfish Head beer and distilled spirits brands outside of the United States and Canada. 
 Angry Orchard Hard Cider
 The Company’s Angry Orchard ciders compete within the hard cider category that has similar characteristics to the beer industry. The Company believes that the hard cider category comprises less than 1% of United States beer consumption and the volume comprising the category grew 4% in 2020. This category is small and highly competitive and includes large international and domestic competitors, as well as many small regional and local hard cider companies. 
 
The Company offers over ten styles of hard cider in the Angry Orchard brand family, most of which are available nationally in the United States. The majority of the promotional and distribution efforts for the Angry Orchard brand family are focused on Angry Orchard Crisp Apple, Angry Orchard Rosé and Angry Orchard Crisp Unfiltered in various bottle, can and keg packages. The Angry Orchard brand also releases a variety of specialty package and draft ciders fermented in limited quantities at is Company-owned Orchard and Cidery in Walden, New York.
 The Company continually evaluates the performance of its various hard seltzer, beer and hard cider products and the rationalization of its product line as a whole. Periodically, the Company discontinues certain styles and packages. Certain styles or brands put on hiatus or discontinued in previous years may be produced for the Company’s variety packs or reintroduced. 
 The Company’s Dogfish Head Brewery Transaction 
 On May 8, 2019, the Company entered into definitive agreements to acquire Dogfish Head Brewery (“Dogfish Head”) and various related operations (the “Transaction”), through the acquisition of all of the equity interests held by certain private entities in Off-Centered Way LLC, the parent holding company of the Dogfish Head operations. In accordance with these agreements, the Company made a payment of $158.4 million, which was placed in escrow pending the satisfaction of certain closing conditions. The Transaction closed on July 3, 2019, for total consideration of $336.0 million consisting of $173.0 million in cash and 429,291 shares of restricted Class A Common Stock that had an aggregate market value as of 
 5


July 3, 2019 of $163.0 million, after taking into account a post-closing cash related adjustment. As required under the definitive agreements, 127,146 of the 429,291 shares of restricted Class A Stock were placed in escrow and will be released no later than July 3, 2029. 
 These shares had a market value on July 3, 2019 of $48.3 million. The timing of the release of these escrowed shares is primarily related to the continued employment with the Company of Samuel A. Calagione III, one of the two Dogfish Head founders. As part of the transaction, distribution rights to the Dogfish Head brand outside of the United States and Canada were retained by the Dogfish Head founders. The fair value of the Transaction is estimated at approximately $317.7 million. 
 The results of operations from Dogfish Head have been included in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations since the July 3, 2019 Transaction closing date. 
 Product Innovations 
 The Company has a proven track record of innovation and building new brands and is committed to maintaining its position as a leading innovator. To that end, the Company continually tests new hard seltzers, beers, hard ciders, distilled spirits and other alcohol beverages and may sell them under various brand labels for evaluation of drinker interest. The Boston Brewery, the Milton Brewery and the Orchard, along with its other larger breweries and brewery tap rooms spend significant time ideating, testing and developing alcohol beverages for the Company’s potential future commercial development and evaluating ingredients and process improvements for existing beverages. 
 The Company’s most significant innovation in 2020 was the national launch of the Truly Lemonade Hard Seltzer Variety Pack, an innovative hard seltzer with a robust flavor, 100 calories and 1 gram of sugar which was among the top introductions in the Hard Seltzer Category during 2020.  In 2021 the Company has planned for several new product introductions, of which the most significant include Truly Iced Tea Hard Seltzer, Twisted Tea ‘Slightly Sweet’, Samuel Adams ‘Wicked Hazy’, Samuel Adams ‘Wicked Easy’, Samuel Adams ‘Just the Haze’, Angry Orchard Hard Fruit Cider and Dogfish Head Scratch-Made Canned Cocktails.  Samuel Adams’ Just the Haze is the Company’s first non-alcoholic beer. The Company is currently in the early stages of these introductions. 
 Sales, Distribution and Marketing 
 As dictated by the legal and regulatory environment, most all of the Company’s sales are made to a network of over 400 wholesalers in the United States and to a network of foreign wholesalers, importers or other agencies (collectively referred to as “Distributors”). These Distributors, in turn, sell the products to retailers, such as grocery stores, club stores, convenience stores, liquor stores, bars, restaurants, stadiums and other retail outlets, where the products are sold to drinkers, and in some limited circumstances to parties who act as sub-distributors. The Company sells its products predominantly in the United States, but also has markets in Canada, Europe, Israel, Australia, New Zealand, the Caribbean, the Pacific Rim, Mexico, and Central and South America. 
 With few exceptions, the Company’s products are not the primary brands in its Distributors’ portfolios. Thus, the Company, in addition to competing with other hard seltzers, beers and hard ciders for a share of the drinker’s business, competes with other brewers for a share of the Distributor’s attention, time and selling efforts. During 2020, the Company’s largest Distributor accounted for approximately 2% of the Company’s gross sales. The top three Distributors collectively accounted for approximately 5% of the Company’s gross sales. In some states and countries, the Company’s contracts with its Distributors may be affected by laws that restrict the enforcement of some contract terms, especially those related to the Company’s right to terminate the relationship. 
 Most of the Company’s products are shipped within days of packaging, resulting in limited finished goods at the Company’s breweries and third-party breweries. The Company receives most of its orders from Distributors in the first week of a month for products to be shipped the following month. Historically, Distributors would carry three to five weeks of packaged inventory and three to four weeks of draft inventory and the Company has been able to meet Distributor orders with limited out of stocks. 
 Beginning in 2019, primarily as a result of higher than anticipated demand for Truly Hard Seltzer and Twisted Tea brands and supply chain constraints, the Company began to have out of stocks and at times has not been able to fully meet Distributor demand, particularly at seasonal peaks during the summer months.  In response to these out of stocks, the Company began working with certain Distributors on plans to increase Distributor inventories of packaged inventory of Truly Hard Seltzer and Twisted Tea brands to ensure that drinker demand can be met. The Company believes distributor inventory 
 6


as of December 26, 2020 averaged approximately 5 weeks on hand and was at an appropriate level, based on supply chain capacity constraints and inventory requirements to support the forecasted growth. The Company expects wholesaler inventory levels in terms of weeks on hand to be between 3 and 7 weeks for most of 2021. 
 Boston Beer has a sales force of approximately 515 people, which the Company believes is one of the largest in the domestic beer industry. The Company’s sales organization is designed to develop and strengthen relations at the Distributor, retailer and drinker levels by providing educational and promotional programs. The Company’s sales force has a high level of product knowledge and is trained in the details of the brewing and selling processes. Sales representatives typically carry samples of the Company’s hard seltzers, beers and hard ciders, certain ingredients, and other promotional materials to educate wholesale and retail buyers about the quality and taste of the Company’s products. The Company has developed strong relationships with its Distributors and retailers, many of which have benefited from the Company’s premium pricing strategy and growth. 
 The Company also engages in media campaigns — including television, digital and social media, radio, billboards and print. These media efforts are complemented by participation in sponsorships, which currently include the National Hockey League, the Boston Red Sox, the Boston Marathon, local concert and festivals, industry-related trade shows and promotional events at local establishments, to the extent permitted under local laws and regulations. The Company uses a wide array of point-of-sale items (banners, neon signs, umbrellas, glassware, display pieces, signs and menu stands) designed to stimulate impulse sales and continued awareness. 
 
COVID-19
 
The Company began seeing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business in early March 2020.  The direct financial impact of the pandemic has primarily shown in significantly reduced keg demand from the on-premise channel and higher labor and safety-related costs at the Company’s breweries. In fiscal year 2020, shipments of kegs decreased to 3% of total shipment volume from 11% of shipments in 2019.  Also, in fiscal year 2020, the Company recorded COVID-19 related pre-tax reductions in net revenue and increases in other costs that total $16.0 million.  In addition to these direct financial impacts, COVID-19 related safety measures resulted in a reduction of brewery productivity. This has shifted more volume to third-party breweries, which increased production costs and negatively impacted gross margins.  Other impacts of COVID-19 on the Company’s business are discussed in “Packaging and Ingredients” below.
 Packaging and Ingredients
 Historically, the Company has been successful in obtaining sufficient quantities of the packaging materials and ingredients used in the production of its beverages.  In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company experienced some can, cardboard wraps and glass shortages that impacted the Company’s production schedules. The Company enters into limited-term supply agreements with certain vendors in order to receive preferential pricing. The Company maintains competitive sources for most all packaging materials and ingredients. In 2020, certain flavorings, crowns and labels were each supplied by a single source; however, the Company believes that alternative suppliers are available. The most significant packaging and ingredients include: 
 Cans. Truly Hard Seltzer brand beverages are primarily packaged in sleek cans and Twisted Tea brand beverages are primarily packaged in standard cans.  In 2020, over 74% of the Company’s total volume was packaged in cans and the Company expects that percentage to further increase in 2021. The demand for cans in the beverage industry has significantly increased and there has been a shortage of capacity, as can manufacturers attempt to adjust their supply chains to keep up with the increased demand which has further accelerated during 2020 as the category grew household penetration and alcohol consumption shifted from on-premise to off-premise. In 2020, as the Truly brand family and the Twisted brand families have grown significantly, the Company has experienced supply shortages and in the fourth quarter of 2020, these supply shortages impacted the Company’s production schedules. The Company is working closely with its three can suppliers to ensure there are no further supply disruptions and the Company has an adequate supply. The Company currently believes that it will have sufficient supply of cans in 2021. 
 Flavorings.  The Company’s hard seltzers, beers and hard ciders include many unique and proprietary flavors and combinations of flavors and some of these flavorings are single sourced. Truly Hard Seltzer and Twisted Tea brand beverages are particularly reliant on the use of flavorings and variety of flavors as part of their appeal to drinkers. The Company is working closely with various flavoring suppliers to ensure it has an adequate supply and currently believes that it will have sufficient supply of flavorings in 2021.   
 7


Cardboard. The Company’s hard seltzers, beers and hard ciders are packaged primarily in cardboard wraps, carriers and cardboard shipping cases. During the fourth quarter of 2020 the Company had a disruption to its supply of cardboard wraps which impacted its production schedules. The Company is working closely with its various cardboard suppliers to ensure that there are no further disruptions and the Company has an adequate supply. The Company currently believes that it will have a sufficient supply of cardboard in 2021.
 Glass.  Many of the Company’s beers and ciders are sold primarily in glass bottles. Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, the demand for glass bottles in the beverage industry has significantly increased and there has been a shortage of capacity, as glass manufacturers attempt to adjust their supply chains to keep up with the increased demand. During the fourth quarter of 2020 the Company had a disruption to its supply of glass bottles which impacted its production schedules. The Company is working closely with its two bottle suppliers to ensure there are no further supply disruptions and the Company has an adequate supply. The Company currently believes that it will have a sufficient supply of glass in 2021. 
 Malt. The two-row varieties of barley used in the Company’s malt are mainly grown in the United States and Canada. The 2020 North American barley crop, which will support 2021 malt needs, was generally consistent with historical long-term averages with regard to both quality and quantity. The Company purchased most of the malt used in the production of its beers from four suppliers during 2020. The Company currently has a multi-year contract with one of its suppliers and a one-year agreement with the other supplier. The Company also believes that there are other malt suppliers available that are capable of supplying its needs. 
 Hops. The Company uses Noble hop varieties from Europe for many of its Samuel Adams beers and also uses hops grown in the other areas of Europe, and in the United States, England and New Zealand. Noble hops are grown in several specific areas in Germany and the Czech Republic and are recognized for growing hops with superior taste and aroma properties. The Company uses hops in various formats including T-90 hop pellets, T-45 hop pellets and CO2 Extract. The Company stores its hops in multiple cold storage warehouses to minimize the impact of a catastrophe at a single site.
 The Company enters into purchase commitments with nine primary hop dealers and attempts to maintain a one to two-year supply of essential hop varieties on-hand in order to limit the risk of an unexpected reduction in supply and procures hops needed for new beers, based on its best estimate of likely short-term demand. The Company classifies hops inventory in excess of two years of forecasted usage as other long term assets. 
 Variations to usage plans could result in hops shortages for specific beers or an excess of certain hops varieties. 
 Yeast. The Company uses multiple yeast strains for production of its beers, hard seltzers and hard ciders. While some strains are commercially available, other strains are proprietary. Since the proprietary strains cannot be replaced if destroyed, the Company protects these strains by storing multiple cultures of the same strain at different production locations and in several independent laboratories. 
 Apples. The Company uses special varieties and origins of apples in its hard ciders that it believes are important for their flavor profiles. In 2020, these apples were sourced primarily from Europe and the United States and include bittersweet apples from France and culinary apples from Italy, Washington State and New York. Purchases and commitments are denominated in Euros for European apples and US Dollars for United States apples. There is limited availability of some of these apple varieties, and many outside factors, including weather conditions, growers rotating from apples to other crops, competitor demand, government regulation and legislation affecting agriculture could affect both price and supply. 
Quality Assurance 
 As of December 26, 2020, the Company employed twenty brewmasters to monitor the Company’s brewing operations and control the production of its hard seltzers, beers, and hard ciders both at Company-owned breweries and at the third-party breweries at which the Company’s products are brewed or fermented. Extensive tests, tastings and evaluations are typically required to ensure that each batch of the Company’s hard seltzers, beers and hard ciders conforms to the Company’s standards. The Company has on-site quality control labs at each of the Company-owned breweries and supports the smaller tap rooms and local breweries with additional centralized lab services. 
 With the exception of certain specialty products, the Company includes a clearly legible “freshness” code on every bottle, can and keg of its hard seltzer, beers and hard ciders, in order to ensure that its drinkers enjoy only the freshest products. Boston Beer was the first American brewer to use this practice.

Production Strategy 
 The Company continues to pursue a production strategy that includes production at breweries owned by the Company and breweries and packaging facilities owned by others. During 2019 and 2020, the Company brewed, fermented and packaged approximately 74% and 65% of its volume at breweries owned by the Company, respectively. The Company made capital investments in 2020 of approximately $140.0 million, most of which represented investments in the Company’s breweries. These investments were made to increase production, drive efficiencies and cost reductions and support product innovation and future growth. Based on its current estimates of future volumes and mix, the Company expects to invest between $300 million and $400 million in 2021 to meet those estimates. Because actual capital investments are highly dependent on meeting demand, the actual amount spent may well be significantly different from the Company’s current expectations. 
 The Pennsylvania Brewery, the Cincinnati Brewery and the Milton Brewery produce most of the Company’s shipment volume from breweries owned by the Company during 2020. The Pennsylvania Brewery is the Company’s largest brewery.
 Production and retail activities at the eight local breweries and tap rooms, is mainly for brewing and packaging beers for retail sales on site at tap rooms and gift shops, restaurant activities, developing innovative and traditional beers and in some cases supporting draft and package accounts in the respective local market areas. 
 The Cidery’s production is mainly for developing new types of innovative hard ciders and fermenting and packaging ciders for retail sales on site at the Cidery and supporting draft and package accounts in the local market area. 
 
The Company currently has a brewing and packaging services agreement with subsidiaries of City Brewing Company, LLC (“City Brewing”).  During 2019 and 2020, City Brewing supplied approximately 23% and 33% of the Company’s annual shipment volume, respectively. In accordance with the brewing and packaging services agreement, the Company has paid to City Brewing $71.5 million dollars for capital improvements at City Brewing facilities and other pre-payments. The agreement includes a minimum capacity availability commitment by City Brewing and the Company is obligated to meet annual minimum volume commitments and is subject to contractual shortfall fees if these annual minimum volume commitments are not met.  The Company has the contractual right to extend its agreement with City Brewing beyond the December 31, 2024 termination date on an annual basis through December 31, 2035. 
 The Company will continue to add production capacity at breweries and packaging facilities owned by others and expects that the percentage of total production at breweries and packaging facilities owned by others will increase in 2021.  The Company carefully selects breweries and packaging facilities owned by others with: (i) sleek can packaging and automated variety packaging capability and capacity; (ii) first-rate quality control capabilities throughout the process; and (iii) the capability of utilizing traditional brewing, fermenting and finishing methods. Under its brewing and packaging arrangements with third parties, the Company is charged a service fee based on units produced at each of the facilities and bears the costs of raw materials, risk, excise taxes and deposits for pallets and kegs and specialized equipment required to produce and package the Company’s beverages. 
 The Company’s international business is supplied by breweries owned by the Company, under third-party brewing and packaging agreements, and production under license at international locations. 
 While the Company believes that it has alternatives available to it, in the event that production at any of its locations is interrupted, severe interruptions at the Pennsylvania Brewery or City Brewing facilities would be problematic, especially in seasonal peak periods. In addition, the Company may not be able to maintain its current economics, if interruptions were to occur, and could face significant delays in starting up replacement production locations. Potential interruptions at breweries include labor issues, governmental actions, quality issues, contractual disputes, machinery failures, operational shutdowns, or natural or other unavoidable catastrophes. Also, as the brewing industry has consolidated and the Company has grown, the capacity and willingness of breweries owned by others where the Company could produce some of its hard seltzers, beers and hard ciders, if necessary, has become a more significant concern. The Company would work with available contract brewers to attempt to minimize any potential disruptions. 
 Competition 
 The High End category within the United States is highly competitive due to large domestic and international brewers and the increasing number of craft brewers in this category who distribute similar products that have similar pricing and target drinkers. 
 9


The two largest brewers in the United States, AB InBev and Molson Coors, participate actively in the High End category, through numerous launches of new hard seltzers from existing beer brands or new brands, importing and distributing import brands, and with their own domestic specialty beers, either by developing new brands or by acquiring, in whole or part, existing craft breweries.  In addition, AB InBev’s High End Division and Molson Coors’ Tenth and Blake were formed as business units headquartered in the United States that are focused exclusively on competing in the High End category. Imported beers, such as Corona®, Heineken®, Modelo Especial® and Stella Artois®, continue to compete aggressively in the United States and have gained market share over the last ten years. Heineken and Constellation Brands (owner of the United States Distribution rights to Corona and Modelo Especial) may have substantially greater financial resources, marketing strength and distribution networks than the Company. 
 The Company’s Truly Hard Seltzer beverages compete primarily within the hard seltzer category. This category has been growing quickly since 2016, is highly competitive and includes large international and domestic competitors. Hard seltzers are typically priced competitively with High End beers and may compete for drinkers with beer, wine, spirits, or FMBs. Some of these competitors include Mark Anthony Brands under the brand name “White Claw”; ABInBev under “Bud Light Seltzer”, “Natural Light Seltzer” and “Bon & Viv’s”; Diageo under “Smirnoff Spiked Sparkling Seltzer”; and MolsonCoors under “Vizzy Hard Sparkling Water” and “Coors Seltzer”. The Company expects numerous additional entrants in the hard seltzer category during 2021 from both large and smaller international and domestic competitors, as the category continues to develop distribution and drinker awareness. Most significantly, ABInbev introduced and launched nationally “Michelob Ultra Organic Seltzer” in January 2021 and Mark Anthony Brands has announced that “Mikes Hard Lemonade Seltzer” and “White Claw Hard Seltzer Iced Tea” will be introduced and launched nationally in Spring 2021. 
 The Company’s Twisted Tea beverages compete primarily within the FMB category of the beer industry.  FMBs, such as Twisted Tea, Mike’s Hard Lemonade®, Smirnoff Ice®, Bud Light Lime® Ritas, Redd’s® Apple Ale, Seagrams Escapes® and Arnold Palmer Spiked, are flavored malt beverages that are typically priced competitively with High End beers.  As noted earlier, this category is highly competitive due to, among other factors, the presence of large brewers and spirits companies in the category, the advertising of malt-based spirits brands in channels not available to the parent brands and a fast pace of product innovation.
 The Company’s Samuel Adams and Dogfish Head beverages compete primarily within the craft beer and domestic specialty beer category of the beer industry.  The Company expects competition and innovation among domestic craft brewers to remain strong, as the number of craft brewers continues to grow. The Company estimates there are over 8,000 breweries in operation, up from approximately 1,500 operating breweries in 2009. Most of these new breweries are craft (small and independent) brewers. Also, some existing craft breweries are building more capacity, adding additional local tap rooms, expanding geographically and adding more SKUs and styles. 
 There have been numerous announcements of acquisitions of or investments in craft brewers by larger breweries and private equity and other investors. In 2019, a unit of global brewer Kirin Holdings Co. announced the acquisition of New Belgium Brewing, the fourth largest craft brewer, for a reported amount of $350 to $400 million. Also in 2019, global brewer Mahou San Miguel increased its ownership of Founders Brewing Co. from 30% to 90% for a reported valuation of approximately $300 million. The most significant acquisitions in the last few years include Heineken’s acquisition of Lagunitas Brewing Company for approximately $1 billion,  AB InBev’s purchase of multiple craft breweries, including Elysian Brewing Company, Golden Road Brewing, Four Peaks Brewing Company, Breckenridge Brewing, Devils Backbone, Karbach, Wicked Weed, Platform Beer and Craft Brew Alliance, and Molson Coors’ purchase of multiple craft breweries, including Hop Valley Brewing, Saint Archer Brewery and Revolver Brewing. 
 The Company’s Angry Orchard product line competes within the hard cider category. As noted earlier, this category is small and highly competitive and includes large international and domestic competitors, as well as many small regional and local hard cider companies. Hard ciders are typically priced competitively with High End Beers and may compete for drinkers with beer, wine, spirits, or FMBs. Some of these competitors include C&C Group PLC under the brand names ‘Woodchuck’, ‘Magners’ and ‘Hornsby’s’; Heineken under the brand names ‘Strongbow’; and AB InBev under ‘Stella Cidre’. In recent years, regional and local cideries, including ‘Bold Rock’ and ‘Austin East Ciders’, have built businesses that have gained share locally at the expense of the national brands. 
 The Company’s products also compete with other alcoholic beverages for drinker attention and consumption and the pace of innovation in the categories in which the Company competes is increasing. In recent years, wine and spirits have been competing more directly with beers. The Company monitors such activity and attempts to develop strategies which benefit from the drinker’s interest in trading up, in order to position its hard seltzers, beers and hard ciders competitively with wine and spirits.

The Company competes with other beer and alcoholic beverage companies within a three-tier distribution system. The Company competes for a share of the Distributor’s attention, time and selling efforts. In retail establishments, the Company competes for shelf, cold box and tap space. From a drinker perspective, competition exists for brand acceptance and loyalty. The principal factors of competition in the market for High End beer occasions include product quality and taste, brand advertising and imagery, trade and drinker promotions, pricing, packaging and the development of innovative new products. 
 The Company distributes its products through independent Distributors who also distribute competitors’ products. Certain brewers have contracts with their Distributors that impose requirements on the Distributors that are intended to maximize the Distributors’ attention, time and selling efforts on that brewer’s products. These contracts generally result in increased competition among brewers as the contracts may affect the manner in which a Distributor allocates selling effort and investment to the brands included in its portfolio. The Company closely monitors these and other trends in its Distributor network and works to develop programs and tactics intended to best position its products in the market. 
 The Company has certain competitive advantages over the local and regional craft brewers, including a long history of awards for product quality, greater available resources and the ability to distribute and promote its products on a more cost-effective basis. Additionally, the Company believes it has competitive advantages over imported beers, including lower transportation costs, higher product quality, a lack of import charges and superior product freshness. 
 Regulation and Taxation 
 The alcoholic beverage industry is regulated by federal, state and local governments. These regulations govern the production, sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages, including permitting, licensing, marketing and advertising. To operate its production facilities, the Company must obtain and maintain numerous permits, licenses and approvals from various governmental agencies, including but not limited to, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (the “TTB”), the Food and Drug Administration, state alcohol regulatory agencies and state and federal environmental agencies. 
 Governmental entities may levy various taxes, license fees and other similar charges and may require bonds to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Beginning in 2018, as a result of the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act”, the Company’s federal excise tax rate on hard seltzer and beer is $16 per barrel on all barrels below 6 million barrels produced annually. The top tier rate on hard cider (with alcohol by volume of 8.5% or less) is $0.226 per gallon, on hard cider (with non-qualifying fermentable fruits) is $1.07 per gallon, and on artificially carbonated wine (hard cider with high CO2 levels) is $3.30 per gallon. Prior to 2018, the federal excise tax on beer and hard seltzer was $18 per barrel, on hard cider (with alcohol by volume of 8.5% or less) was $0.226 per gallon, on hard cider (with non-qualifying fermentable fruits) was $1.07 per gallon, and on artificially carbonated wine (hard cider with high CO2 levels) was $3.30 per gallon. These lower rates for hard seltzer, beer and hard cider were made permanent at the end of 2020. States levy excise taxes at varying rates based on the type of beverage and alcohol content. Failure by the Company to comply with applicable federal, state or local laws and regulations could result in higher taxes, penalties, fees and suspension or revocation of permits, licenses or approvals. While there can be no assurance that any such regulatory action would not have a material adverse effect upon the Company or its operating results, the Company is not aware of any infraction affecting any of its licenses or permits that would materially impact its ability to continue its current operations. 
 Trademarks 
 The Company has obtained trademark registrations with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for over 400 trademarks, including Samuel Adams®, Sam Adams®, Samuel Adams Boston Lager®, Samuel Adams Brewing the American Dream®, Twisted Tea®, Truly®, Truly Hard Seltzer®, Angry Orchard®, Dogfish Head®, Coney Island®, Angel City Brewery® and Concrete Beach®. It also has a number of common law trademarks. Several Company trademarks are also registered or have registrations pending in various foreign countries. The Company regards its trademarks as having substantial value and as being an important factor in the marketing of its products. The Company is not aware of any trademark infringements that could materially affect its current business or any prior claim to the trademarks that would prevent the Company from using such trademarks in its business. The Company’s policy is to pursue registration of its marks whenever appropriate and to oppose infringements of its marks through available enforcement options. 
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulations and Operating Considerations 
 The Company’s operations are subject to a variety of extensive and changing federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws, regulations and ordinances that govern activities or operations that may have adverse effects on human health or the environment. Environmental laws, regulations or ordinances may impose liability for the cost 
 11


of remediation of, and for certain damages resulting from, sites of past releases of hazardous materials. The Company believes that it currently conducts, and in the past has conducted, its activities and operations in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws, and believes that any costs arising from existing environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. 
 As part of its efforts to be environmentally responsible, the Company has adopted a number of practices designed to improve recycling, waste reduction, and utilities consumption at its breweries.
 The Company has adopted various policies and procedures intended to ensure that its facilities meet occupational health and safety requirements. The Company believes that it currently is in compliance with applicable requirements and will continue to endeavor to remain in compliance. There can be no assurances, however, that new and more restrictive requirements might not be adopted, compliance with which might have a material, adverse financial effect on the Company and its operating results, or that such policies and procedures will be consistently followed and be sufficient to prevent serious accidents. 
 
Human Capital Resources
 
As of December 26, 2020, the Company had 2,423 employees, of which 87 were represented by unions or similar organizations. The Company’s Executive Leadership Team (“ELT”) is comprised of our CEO and his six direct reports who collectively have management responsibility for our primary business areas, including but not limited to brewing, supply chain operations, sales, marketing, finance, and people and culture. The Company’s Board of Directors and the ELT believe that succession planning, talent management, culture, and diversity, equity, and inclusion are critical to the Company’s continued success. 
 Succession Planning and Talent Management
 
The Company regularly reviews talent development and succession plans for each of its functional areas to identify and develop a pipeline of talent to maintain business operations. The Company understands the potential costs and risks of bringing in an outside executive officer in today’s environment, and that businesses are often – but not always – more successful in promoting internal candidates. Accordingly, the Board of Directors and the ELT make efforts to identify potential successors for those positions long in advance of any potential positional vacancies, perform skills gap analyses for those internal candidates, and provide training and exposure on those gap areas to those candidates in order to develop better potential successors. The Board of Directors is primarily responsible for succession planning for the CEO, but also participates in succession planning discussions for other executive officer positions. The Company believes that its culture, compensation structure, long-term equity program, and robust training and development program provide motivation for talented leaders to remain with the Company. 
Culture
 
The ELT discusses culture with its employees and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. The Company is continuously focused on developing an inclusive and respectful work environment where all employees at every level should feel empowered to honestly “discuss the undiscussables” with other employees at any level, all the way up to the Chairman and the CEO, without fear of retribution or retaliation. The Chairman teaches this philosophy during orientation to all new employees, and each company-wide meeting has time set aside to discuss the undiscussables. Additionally, each year the Board meets with a set of key senior managers, without the ELT present, so that the Board may seek direct feedback on the Company, its practices, culture, and employee benefits and programs. 
 
The Company also fosters a culture of ongoing training and education. Some examples of trainings provided to employees include New Employee Orientation, Respectful and Effective Communications, Leading the Boston Beer Company Way, Selling Skills, Negotiations, and Building Brands. Employees also receive beer and cider education training during New Employee Orientation. Then, after having been with the Company for one year, employees are encouraged to participate in further beer and cider education courses where they can train to be certified as industry experts in those areas. The Company believes that it has the most beer industry experts, called “Certified Cicerones,” in the beer industry. 
 
In October 2020, the Company rolled out a formal mentoring and leadership program to connect dozens of senior and junior employees across a range of backgrounds with the purpose of diversifying perspectives, building networks, developing capabilities, growing competencies, and cultivating leadership. 
 
The Company also regularly conducts internal engagement surveys of its employee base to help ensure that it is maintaining its culture. In 2020, over 72% of employees participated in the survey, which resulted in high scores in response to the 
 12


questions related to pride in working for the Company, believing in the Company’s values, the Company’s concern for employee safety, confidence in the future of the Company, and pride in the Company’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
 
As an equal opportunity employer, the Company is committed to creating an inclusive and diverse work environment that promotes equal opportunity, dignity, and respect for all and increases diverse representation in leadership roles. The Company is focused on expanding the diverse perspectives of its employee base, which is critical to continued success. Over the past two years, the Company has taken numerous steps in furtherance of this goal:

• | Every employee of the Company is required to undergo extensive unconscious bias training.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Diversity was an area of discussion at our National Company Meetings.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Company created an Employee Resource Group platform designed to provide an outlet for employees to come together around shared life experiences and provide a safe place to foster inclusivity and connection. As of 2020, the Company had six employee resource groups focused in the areas of diversity and inclusion, LGBTQIA+, working parents, veterans, drug and alcohol support, and sustainability.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Diversity was the sole focus of our annual “Action Learning Project” in 2019, where a cross-functional group of high-potential employees is formed annually to tackle an issue of vital importance to the Company. The Action Learning Project Group met every week for over ten months, identifying potential solutions to improve diversity across the Company. The group presented its findings and proposed solutions to the Executive Leadership Team and a leadership group consisting of the Company’s key senior managers in late 2019.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In early 2020, the “Action Learning Project” project evolved into the creation of a Diversity & Inclusion Committee. The goal of the committee is to continue to advance the efforts of fostering open dialogue about diversity, equity, and inclusion, maintaining a culture that values everyone, regardless of their identity, and ensuring everyone at the Company is treated with dignity and respect. The Committee held monthly forum meetings over the course of 2020 open to all employees.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In early 2021, the Diversity & Inclusion Committee collaborated with the Company’s Talent Acquisition team to work on expanding the diversity of the employee candidate pipeline. Those efforts included auditing college and university partners, researching and reaching out to historically black colleges and Hispanic serving institutes, and focusing efforts on diverse recruiting and job board sites.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Company sponsored a seminar series to bring guest speakers and experts across multiple facets of diversity and inclusion to speak to employees and business partners.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Company established long-term relationships with the NAACP, Civic Alliance, and GLAAD to further our knowledge and support of issues facing black, brown, and LGTBQIA+ communities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Company participated in the #StopHateForProfit boycott that asked companies to halt spending advertising funds with certain social media platforms, with the purpose of encouraging those platforms to increase the monitoring and regulation of hate, racism, and disinformation by users.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In 2020, the Company appointed an employee to the newly-created full-time position of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Leader to spearhead the Company’s diversity and inclusion efforts. The position also serves as a member of the Company’s newly-created Social Impact Team.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In 2020 the Company formed a multi-cultural task force, comprised of a cross-functional group of employees, to analyze and support the evolving makeup and needs of the Company’s consumer base. Over the course of year, the Company leveraged its brands as external platforms to amplify these values and support diverse causes. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As of December 26, 2020, 2 of the 9 members of the Board of Directors were female and 1 of 9 self-identified as part of an underrepresented minority group; 3 of 11 Executive Officers were female and 1 of 11 self-identified as part of an underrepresented minority group. Across the Company’s broader professional population, approximately 34.5% are female and 16.6% self-identified as part of an underrepresented minority group. In 2020, approximately 41.8% of new hires were female and 19.8% identified as an underrepresented minority group, both of which were improvements over 2019.
 Corporate Social Responsibility 
 The Company’s core philanthropic initiative is Samuel Adams Brewing the American Dream®. In partnership with ACCION, one of the nation’s largest non-profit micro-lenders, the program supports small business owners in the food, beverage, and 
 13


brewing industries through access to business capital, coaching, and new market opportunities. The goal is to help strengthen small businesses, create local jobs and build vibrant communities. Since the inception of the Samuel Adams Brewing the American Dream program in 2008, the Company and ACCION have worked together to loan more than $64 million to more than 3,200 small business owners who have subsequently repaid these loans at a rate of more than 95%. The loan repayments received are reinvested into the program. Boston Beer employees, together with local business partners and community organizations, have provided coaching and mentoring to more than 12,000 business owners across the country. These efforts have helped to create or maintain more than 9,000 local jobs.
