Overview
Arconic Corporation ("Arconic" or the "Company") is a global leader in manufacturing aluminum sheet, plate, extrusions and architectural products and systems, serving primarily the ground transportation, aerospace, building and construction, industrial, and packaging end markets. We maintain a competitive position in our targeted markets through our global footprint of 20 primary manufacturing facilities, as well as various sales and service facilities, located across North America, Europe, the United Kingdom and China. 
On April 1, 2020 (the “Separation Date”), ParentCo separated into two standalone, publicly-traded companies, Arconic and Howmet (the “Separation”). The spin-off company, Arconic, comprised the rolled aluminum products, aluminum extrusions, and architectural products operations of ParentCo, as well as the Latin America extrusions operations sold in April 2018 (collectively, the “Arconic Corporation Businesses”).

"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Segment Information—Rolled Products,” and Note S to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” For a discussion of legal proceedings involving our facility in Samara, Russia prior to the sale, see Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” under the caption “Contingencies and Commitments—Contingencies—Litigation—Federal Antimonopoly Service Of The Russian Federation Litigation."
Description of the Business
We manage our business operations through three reportable segments: Rolled Products, Building and Construction Systems ("BCS") and Extrusions. We strive to make our portfolio of facilities operationally efficient and competitive in the industry. We are well positioned in attractive end markets, and our long-term contracts with customers enhance the strength and stability of our business and our earnings. We believe our extensive manufacturing experience and our commitment to quality and innovation are competitive advantages. 
Rolled Products
Rolled products are used in the production of finished goods ranging from automotive body panels and airframes to industrial plate and brazing sheet. Sheet and plate are used extensively in the transportation industries as well as in building and construction and packaging. They are also used for industrial applications such as tooling plate for the production of plastic products.
Our Rolled Products segment produces a range of aluminum sheet and plate products for the following end markets:
Ground Transportation — provides specialty aluminum sheet and plate products, including auto body sheet, structural reinforcement, proprietary heat exchanger products like multilayer brazing sheet, trailer and cab structures, vehicle components, mold plate for wheels, and sheet for fuel tanks.
Aerospace — supplies a wide range of highly differentiated sheet and plate products that meet strict quality requirements for aerospace applications, including polished fuselage sheet, structural parts, aluminum-lithium stringers, and wing skins.
Industrial — supplies a diverse range of industrial solutions for applications that include mold and tooling plate for semiconductors; general engineering/machinery and injection molding applications; specialty finishes for appliances, cosmetic packaging and RVs; tread plate/sheet for toolbox and flooring applications; and circles for cookware.

Packaging — serves the packaging end market in North America, primarily through our facility in Tennessee, and the markets in Asia and Mexico through our facility located in Bohai, China.  
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Competitive Conditions
Our Rolled Products segment is one of the leaders in many of the aluminum flat rolled end markets in which it participates, including the ground transportation, aerospace, industrial, building and construction, and packaging end markets. While Rolled Products participates in end markets where we believe we have a significant competitive advantage due to our extensive knowledge of our customers, advanced manufacturing capability, unique technology and/or differentiated products, in certain cases, our competitors are capable of making products similar to our products. We continuously work to maintain and enhance our competitive position through innovation: new alloys such as high-formability automotive alloys, aluminum lithium aerospace alloys, differentiated products such as our 5-layer brazing products and break-through processes such as A951™ bonding technology.
Some of our Rolled Products markets are global and some are more regionally focused. Participation in these markets by competitors varies. Additionally, there are a number of new competitors emerging, particularly in China and other developing economies. We expect that this competitive pressure will continue and increase in the future as customers seek to globalize their supply bases in order to reduce costs.

Extrusions participates in end markets where we believe we have a significant competitive position due to our extensive knowledge of our customers, advanced manufacturing capability, unique technology and/or differentiated products. We continuously work to maintain and enhance our competitive position through innovation: new alloys such as aluminum lithium aerospace alloys and differentiated products.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Some of our Extrusions end markets are worldwide and some are more regionally focused. Participation in these segments by competitors varies. Additionally, there are a number of other competitors emerging, particularly in China and other developing economies. We expect that this competitive pressure will continue and increase in the future as customers seek to globalize their supply bases in order to reduce costs.
Principal Facilities
The table below sets forth our Extrusions principal properties as of December 31, 2022.

Principal facilities are listed and do not include locations that have been idled. In the second half of 2021, the Chandler, AZ facility was fully idled and its commercial operations were integrated into the Lafayette facility. The Company may temporarily restart one or more of the presses at Chandler over short periods of time to address customer demand requirements. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Extrusions—Overview.”
End Market and Customer Revenues
We provide products to customers in a number of end markets, and the revenues from any end market may vary from year to year. For more information regarding revenues by major end markets served, see Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II. Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." In addition, the demand for products in certain end markets is concentrated in a relatively small number of customers. We have multi-year contracts with many of our key customers, primarily in the aerospace and ground transportation end markets. These contracts indirectly expose us to changes in these customers' end markets, and the loss of sales under these contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business if such sales are not replaced by sales to other customers. 
Customer and Distribution Channels
Rolled Products and Extrusions
Our Rolled Products and Extrusions segments have two primary sales channels: direct sales to our customers and sales to distributors.
Direct Sales
Our Rolled Products and Extrusions segments supply various customers all over the world through a direct sales force operating from individual facilities or sales offices. The direct sales channel typically serves very large, sophisticated customers and OEMs, but can service medium and small size customers as well. Long-standing relationships are maintained with leading companies in industries using aluminum rolled and extruded products. Supply contracts for large global customers generally range from one to five years in length and historically there has been a high degree of renewal business with these customers. As the manufacture of higher aluminum content vehicles continues to grow, we continue to develop long-term relationships with the automotive original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). In some cases, the products we supply are proprietary in nature. Further, certain industries, such as automotive and aerospace, and their related customers require suppliers to complete a rigorous qualification process. The ability to obtain and maintain these qualifications is an important part of doing business in these segments. A customer’s cost to switch and either find a new product or qualify a new supplier can be significant, so it is in both the customer’s and the supplier’s best interest to maintain these relationships.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Distributors
Our Rolled Products and Extrusions segments also sell their products through third-party distributors. Customers of distributors are typically widely dispersed, and sales through this channel are usually highly fragmented. Distributors sell mostly commodity or less specialized products into many end-use segments in smaller quantities.
Building and Construction Systems
Our BCS segment supplies architectural facade systems and products principally in North America and Europe but also globally through both direct sales and distributors. Its typical customers are installers or fabricators who purchase product on a project-by-project basis. Long-standing relationships are maintained with its leading customers. BCS also maintains an e-commerce platform for numerous standard architectural products for use by its North American customers and offers standard architectural products for purchase in its service centers.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
Important raw materials used by Arconic are: primary aluminum for remelting (sows, t-bars, and ingots, including high purity and off-grade), aluminum alloyed and unalloyed casthouse products (including rolling slab and billet), aluminum scrap, alloying materials (including, but not limited to, magnesium, copper, and zinc), aluminum coil, electricity, natural gas, coatings, lube oil, packaging materials, and resin. Generally, other materials are purchased from third-party suppliers under competitively priced supply contracts or bidding arrangements. We believe that the raw materials necessary to our businesses are and will continue to be available generally, although we experience and anticipate continued cost, availability and other impacts to our supply chain arising from, among other factors, the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical instability in areas where we or our suppliers operate, challenges with transportation and logistics, and inflationary price pressures.
Intellectual Property 
We believe that our domestic and international intellectual property assets provide us with a significant competitive advantage, as we continue to strive to improve our products and processes. Our rights under our patents, as well as the products made and sold under them, are important to us as a whole, and to varying degrees, important to each business segment. The patents owned by us generally concern metal alloys, particular products, and manufacturing equipment or techniques. Our business as a whole is not, however, materially dependent on any single patent, trademark or other intellectual property. As a result of product development and technological advancement, we continue to pursue patent protection in select jurisdictions throughout the world. As of December 31, 2022, our worldwide patent portfolio consists of approximately 500 granted patents and 225 pending patent applications. Patent terms extend for varying periods based on the filing date or the grant date in the various countries where we have or have applied for patent protection. The actual protection afforded by a patent varies from country to country, with the most significant variations relating to the scope of patent protection and the legal remedies available. 
With respect to domestic and foreign trademarks, we have many that have significant recognition within the markets that are served. Examples include the name “Arconic” and the Arconic symbol for aluminum products, Kawneer for building panels, and Reynobond and Reynolux for architectural products. As of December 31, 2022, our worldwide trademark portfolio consists of approximately 1,060 registered trademarks and 60 pending trademark applications. Our rights under our trademarks are important to us as a whole and, to varying degrees, important to each business segment. Trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and in others for as long as it remains registered. Registrations generally are periodically renewable for additional fixed terms.
Research and Development
We engage in research and development programs that include process and product development, and basic and applied research. The Arconic Technology Center, located in New Kensington, Pennsylvania, serves as the headquarters for our research and development efforts, with additional research and development facilities in Norcross, Georgia; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Runcorn, United Kingdom; Vendargues, France; and Harderwijk, Netherlands. These facilities focus on innovation and have given us a leading position in the development of proprietary next-generation specialty alloys, products and manufacturing processes as evidenced by our robust intellectual property portfolio.
Government Regulations
As a global company, our business is subject to government regulations in various jurisdictions in which we operate. We believe we are materially compliant with all applicable government laws and regulations, and maintaining compliance, other than as noted below, is not expected to materially affect our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Any new or amended laws or regulations that impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements may negatively 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

impact our business, capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position. Additional information is included in Part I. Item 1A. "Risk Factors."
Our operations are subject to national, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, greenhouse gas emissions, hazardous materials in products, chemical usage and workplace safety requirements and protocols. We maintain a global environmental, health and safety program that includes policies and procedures; dedicated environmental, health and safety personnel; procedures for handling of waste materials and hazardous materials; monitoring, reporting and remediating environmental, health, and safety issues; compliance auditing; and training, among other measures. 
Approved capital expenditures for new or existing facilities for environmental control are approximately $8 million for 2023. Additional information relating to environmental matters and other matters is included in Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II. Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" under the caption “Contingencies and Commitments — Contingencies - Environmental Matters.”
Other than the foregoing, we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2023 related to compliance with environmental or other government regulations.
Sustainability and Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)
Arconic is committed to being a good corporate citizen and living our core values by working with our stakeholders to create a better, more sustainable future. Arconic has a cross-functional ESG Council tasked with developing and implementing our sustainability strategy. The ESG Council regularly reports to executive leadership and to the Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors, which has general oversight responsibility for ESG matters, working in conjunction with other committees of the Board of Directors to which oversight of specific matters have been delegated. Functions responsible for development and implementation of our sustainability commitments, strategies and initiatives directly report to the Chief Executive Officer. In 2022, Arconic engaged a third party to advise in the development of long-term sustainability goals based on findings from the Materiality Assessment conducted in 2021. The Materiality Assessment included stakeholder engagement on a wide range of issues, including managing the impacts of our business on the climate and environment, ensuring supply chain sustainability, and fostering positive human capital dynamics. We expect continued engagement to enhance our understanding of stakeholder views, which help guide our ESG efforts. The use of the terms “material” or “materiality” in this section and in our 2022 ESG disclosures is not related to or intended to convey matters or facts that could be deemed “material” to a reasonable investor within the meaning of U.S. securities laws or similar requirements of other jurisdictions.
Human Capital Resources
At Arconic, we are committed to living our core values by protecting and improving the health and safety of our employees, our communities and the environment. We strive to cultivate an inclusive and diverse culture that advocates for equity, acts with integrity, and upholds high standards for human rights. We strengthen our global workforce by providing learning opportunities, employee engagement programs and talent development efforts that drive innovation, agility, people development and collaboration.
Our worldwide employment at the end of 2022 was approximately 11,550 employees located in 17 countries. The breakdown of our employees by region is as follows:

Region | Percentage of Total Population
Americas | 74% 
Europe, Middle East and Africa | 18% 
Asia | 8% 

Turnover
During 2022, the Company increased hiring initiatives to support the business’s organic growth strategy, including participation in various local and national recruiting events, encouraging and responding to employee feedback through its engagement survey, and leveraging social media campaigns as a vehicle to reach a broader base of existing and potential employees. As a result of these and other targeted efforts, in 2022 the Company’s employee base increased by approximately 590 employees. This net increase was offset by a reduction of approximately 2,900 employees resulting from the sale of our facility in Samara, Russia in November 2022.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Collective Bargaining Representation
We believe in freedom of association. We respect an individual’s choice to be represented by – or not be represented by – a union or other legally authorized associations or organizations in accordance with the laws of the countries in which we operate. Many of our employees are represented by labor unions. We believe that relations with any applicable union representatives are generally constructive and professional. In the U.S., approximately 4,100 employees are represented by various labor unions. The largest collective bargaining agreement is the master collective bargaining agreement between us and the United Steelworkers (“USW”). The USW master agreement covers approximately 3,500 employees at four U.S. locations. The prior master collective bargaining agreement with the USW expired on May 15, 2022, and we entered into a new labor agreement that expires on May 15, 2026. There are seven other collective bargaining agreements in the U.S. with varying expiration dates. On a local basis, there are agreements between Arconic and unions with varying expiration dates that cover employees in Europe, North America, and Asia.
Governance
Oversight responsibility for the Company’s ESG policies and strategies has been delegated by our Board of Directors to our Governance and Nominating Committee, which works in conjunction with other committees of the Board to which oversight of specific matters have been delegated. For example, the responsibilities of our Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board of Directors include the oversight of talent management strategies, such as the Company’s recruitment, development, employee engagement, promotion and retention programs; policies and practices promoting diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”) within the Company; key metrics and objectives related to the Company’s talent; and the succession plan for our executive officers. Our Board of Directors is also committed to our talent management and has oversight responsibility for our safety practices.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We are committed to maintaining an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued, and we celebrate both the differences and similarities among our people. We also believe that diversity in all areas, including cultural background, experience and thought, is essential in making our Company stronger. Consistent with that belief, we conducted focused recruiting and retention initiatives that further demonstrate our ongoing commitment to DEI. The breakdown of our female and U.S. ethnic minority employees globally at the end of 2022, as members of management and as executives, is as follows:

 | Total % | Management % | Executive %
Women | 17.7% | 25.8% | 30.0% 
Minorities | 25.6% | 13.1% | 20.0% 

(1) Percentages are on a global basis and include locations where Arconic has valid data. Some regions and countries, such as Germany, have privacy laws and regulations that may prevent Arconic from reporting on certain employee demographics and those regions or countries are not included in the global percentages of female employees.
(2) Percentages are on a U.S. basis only.
(3) Represents members of management, other than executives.
(4) Represents our leaders who serve in a Vice President or higher role.
Our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Council, chaired by our Chief Executive Officer, continues to advance our mission in partnership with our six employee resource groups (“ERGs”) with senior executives volunteering as sponsors for each group. Our six ERGs – Arconic African Heritage Network, Arconic Hispanic Network, Arconic Next Generation Network, Arconic Veterans Network, Thrive Network (Women) and Spectrum (LGBTQ+) – reflect an inclusive, respectful and values-based company culture. All of our employees are encouraged to participate in these grassroots, employee-led organizations that: 
•Drive employee engagement through community outreach; 
•Provide learning and development opportunities for employees; 
•Help position Arconic as a global employer of choice through strategic recruiting activities;
•Inform Company policies around diversity and inclusion; and 
•Reinforce our brand through key external endorsements such as the Human Rights Campaign and the United Nations Women’s Empowerment Principles.
With the momentum gained from our Grow Together campaigns in 2020 and 2021, we broadened our Grow Together scope in 2022 to integrate equity into our mission, demonstrating our commitment to create a work environment with equal opportunities for all. Grow Together continues to provide momentum to enable our DEI focus and encourages employees to take actions related to inclusion, diversity or social justice through learning activities and volunteering. Employees based in the U.S. also have the opportunity to donate to various non-profit organizations with a social equity mission aligned with and recommended by our ERGs and receive a matching contribution from the Arconic Foundation, an independently endowed 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

foundation. As a result, in 2022 the Arconic Foundation granted over $34,000 in matching contributions to organizations that are driving change with DEI initiatives. In addition, the Arconic Foundation granted over $960,000 to non-profits that support inclusivity and social equity in communities where Arconic operates.
Talent Development
We are committed to attracting, retaining, and developing talent that shares our values and demonstrates agility, results focus, and people development capability. All employees have access to a robust, ongoing career planning and performance management process that begins at recruitment and continues throughout their careers. Our twice-yearly succession-planning and calibration processes help us identify successors to business-critical roles while developing our high-potential employees. In addition, we offer management skills training to all supervisory employees, leadership development and coaching programs for mid- and senior-level leaders, and a variety of technical, business, and soft skills training programs to help our business units and resource units meet their strategic objectives.
Compensation and Benefits Programs 
Our compensation and benefits programs are designed to provide comprehensive total rewards to attract, motivate, engage and retain a talented workforce. Our programs are competitive with our peers and emphasize performance-based compensation to align employee rewards with company performance. Benefits are a key component of our total rewards package. We offer a holistic benefits package designed to provide greater security for our employees and their families, which depending on country may include healthcare, life insurance, paid parental leave, disability, savings and retirement and various welfare benefit programs through plans we sponsor or through social programs in the countries where we operate.
Health and Safety
We value human life above all else and are committed to operating worldwide in a safe, responsible manner which respects the environment and the health of our employees, our customers and the communities where we operate. Our strong health and safety culture empowers our employees and contractors to take personal responsibility for their actions and the safety of their coworkers. Our focus on safety also includes an ongoing commitment to maintaining a secure work environment that respects the dignity and worth of every employee, which drives our continuous improvement approach in our robust safety programs. Our employees play an important role in actively supporting a workplace that strives to be free of violence, threats, intimidation, and harassment. This culture is supported by internal policies, standards, rules and procedures that clearly articulate our stringent expectations for working safely and maintaining a secure work environment in all of our facilities worldwide.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate. We established strict requirements for onsite work that is continually assessed against the Centers for Disease Control and other expert guidance to assure that we are providing a safe work environment. We continue to adapt our requirements in response to the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including new and developing variants, in the various regions in which we operate.
We are committed to achieving zero fatalities and keeping a major focus on fatality prevention. Each location maintained an active fatality prevention team and had zero employee and contractor fatalities in 2022. We have prioritized our risk management processes toward fatality and serious injury potential to focus on the most impactful hazards that have the potential for life-altering outcomes. In addition, during 2022, all of our key safety rates remained significantly below the most recent U.S. industry averages. At 0.48, our 2022 days away, restricted and transfer (“DART”) was less than 1 percent lower than our adjusted 2021 DART of 0.482. Our 2022 total recordable incident rate (“TRR”) of 1.39 (recorded in accordance with U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) record keeping requirements) was 35% higher than our adjusted 2021 TRR of 1.03. Our previously reported 2021 DART was 0.42 and 2021 TRR was 0.88. Both rates for 2021 were adjusted above to exclude safety rates for our facility in Samara, Russia that was sold in November 2022. At the time of the sale of our Samara facility in November 2022, our 2022 DART (including our Samara facility) was 0.41 versus our unadjusted 2021 DART of 0.42 and our 2022 TRR (including our Samara facility) was 1.11 versus our unadjusted 2021 TRR of 0.88.
