ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
CORPORATE INFORMATION
 
Salem Media Group, Inc. (“Salem”) is a domestic multimedia company specializing in Christian and conservative content, with media properties comprising radio broadcasting, digital media, and publishing. Effective February 19, 2015, we changed our name from Salem Communications Corporation to Salem Media Group, Inc. Salem was formed in 1986 as a California corporation and was reincorporated in Delaware in 1999. Our content is intended for audiences interested in Christian and family-themed programming and conservative news talk. Our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) are available under the Investor Relations section of our website at www.salemmedia.com. Any information found our website is not a part of, or incorporated by reference into, this or any report of Salem filed with, or furnished to the SEC.
SEGMENT INFORMATION
 
We have three operating segments: (1) Broadcast, (2) Digital Media, and (3) Publishing, which also qualify as reportable segments. Our operating segments reflect how our chief operating decision makers, which we define as a collective group of senior executives, assess the performance of each operating segment and determine the appropriate allocations of resources to each segment. We continually review our operating segment classifications to align with operational changes in our business and may make changes as necessary.
 
We measure and evaluate our operating segments based on operating income and operating expenses that do not include allocations of costs related to corporate functions, such as accounting and finance, human resources, legal, tax and treasury, which are reported as unallocated corporate expenses in our consolidated statements of operations included in this annual report on Form 10-K. We also exclude costs such as amortization, depreciation, taxes and interest expense.
 
During the third quarter of 2016, we reclassed Salem Consumer Products, our e-commerce business that sells books, DVD’s and editorial content developed by our on-air personalities, from our Digital Media segment to our Broadcast segment. This reclassification was to consolidate all revenue and expenses generated by on-air hosts, which includes broadcast programs and e-commerce product sales, to better assess the financial performance of each network program. This reclassification did not impact the reporting units used to test non-amortizable assets for impairment. All prior periods presented are updated to reflect this new composition of our operating segments. Refer to Note 20 – Segment Data in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.
 
Business Strategy
 
We are fundamentally committed to programming and content emphasizing Christian values, conservative family themes and news. Our commitment to these values means that we may choose not to switch to other formats or pursue potentially more profitable business opportunities in response to changes in audience preferences.
 
Our goal is to produce and deliver compelling content to audiences interested in Christian and family-themed programming and conservative news talk to be considered the market leader for all audiences, programmers and advertisers. Our integrated multimedia platform includes traditional forms of media, such as radio broadcasting, print magazines and book publishing as well as emerging forms of media, such as websites and digital publications. We continually pursue expansion of our media platform as the marketplace evolves while aggressively managing operating costs and cash flows. Expansion opportunities for our media platform include increasing the strength and reach of our broadcast signals, investing in and building Internet websites, promoting our authors and on-air talent, and increasing the distribution and page views for our print and digital content. Our national presence in each of these mediums provides advertisers and programmers with a powerful and integrated platform to reach audiences throughout the United States without compromising the sense of community involvement and branding that we generate locally with sponsored events and promotions.
 
Broadcasting
 
Our foundational business is the ownership and operation of radio stations in large metropolitan markets. Our radio stations carry national and local programming content as well as advertising from national and local customers. We produce and sponsor a number of community events that we believe are important in building our brand identity. We also believe that our active community involvement, including remote broadcasts, client events, concerts and tie-ins to major events, builds station awareness and listener loyalty. We promote our station websites on-air and at community events to direct participants to our websites specifically designed for each of our radio stations. Our audiences can access our entire library of digital content and online publications from any of our station websites.
 
To operate our broadcast entities efficiently, we assemble market clusters, or multiple radio stations operating within the same geographic market. Several benefits are achievable when operating market clusters. First, we are able to offer advertisers and programmers access to multiple audiences by providing airtime on each radio station in that market when advantageous. Second, we realize cost and operating efficiencies by consolidating sales, technical and administrative support, promotional functions and other shared overhead costs such as rent, when possible. Third, the addition of new radio stations into existing markets allows us to leverage our hands-on knowledge of that market to increase our appeal to new audiences and advertisers.

Salem Radio Network® and Salem Media Representatives™
 
Our broadcasting operation includes our national network of affiliated radio stations. Salem Radio Network® (“SRN”), based in Dallas, Texas, develops, produces and syndicates a broad range of programming specifically targeted to Christian and family-themed talk stations, music stations and News Talk stations. SRN delivers programming via satellite to approximately 2,900 affiliated radio stations throughout the United States, including several of our Salem-owned stations. We also own and operate SRN News Network (“SNN”), Today’s Christian Music (“TCM”) and Singing News Network (formerly Solid Gospel Network), which are radio networks that produce and distribute talk, news and music programming to radio stations throughout the United States, including several of our Salem-owned stations.
Salem Media RepresentativesTM (“SMR”) is our national advertising sales firm with offices in nine U.S. cities. SMR specializes in placing national advertising on religious and other format commercial radio stations. SMR sells commercial airtime to national advertisers on our radio stations and through our networks, as well as for independent radio station affiliates.
 
National companies often prefer to advertise across the United States as an efficient and cost effective way to reach their target audiences. Advertisers can benefit from our national platform under which we offer radio airtime, digital advertisements, and print magazine advertisements that reach audiences throughout the United States. SRN and our radio stations each have relationships with SMR for the sale of available SRN spot advertising. SMR also contracts with individual radio stations to sell airtime to national advertisers desiring to include selected Salem stations in national buys covering multiple markets.
 
Digital Media
 
Our digital strategy is to continue to build a robust web-based platform designed for audiences interested in Christian and family-themed content and conservative news. The Internet continues to change the way in which media is delivered to audiences. Continual advancements with online search engines and social media sites provide consumers with numerous methods to locate specific information and content online. These advancements have also enabled a large number of individuals to create and publish content that may or may not be tailored to a specific consumer. Our editorial staff, including our on-air personalities, provides web-based commentaries, programs, text, audio and video content that we believe to be knowledge-based, credible and reliable. Our highly specific web-based content provides advertisers a unique and powerful way to reach their targeted audiences.
Publishing
 
Our publishing strategy mirrors that of our other operating segments — to build and maintain a distribution network targeting audiences interested in Christian and family-themed content as well as conservative news. Our publishing operating segment is comprised of three businesses: (1) Regnery Publishing is a traditional book publisher that has published dozens of bestselling books by leading conservative authors and personalities, including Ann Coulter, Newt Gingrich, David Limbaugh, Ed Klein, Mark Steyn and Dinesh D'Souza; (2) Salem Author Services, our self-publishing services for authors through Xulon Press and Hillcrest Media; and (3) Salem Publishing™ which produces and distributes five print magazines and one digital magazine.Audience Growth
 
The continued success of our business is dependent upon our ability to reach a growing audience. We seek growth opportunities through increases in the strength and number of our broadcast signals, increases in the number of page-views on our digital platform, increases in book sales and increases in our subscriber base for digital content and print magazines. To accomplish this, we produce content that we believe is both compelling and of high commercial value based on our market testing and understanding of our audience. We rely on a combination of research, marketing, targeted promotions and live events to create visibility and brand awareness in each of our markets. By maximizing our audience share, we can achieve growth in ratings and page turns that we convert into advertising revenues. To maximize results, we cross-promote our content on each of our media platforms to enhance our brand names and reach our targeted audiences. We believe that the growth of our media platform and audience provides advertisers with effective methods to reach a growing audience.

Technical Improvements
 
We continually seek ways to expand our media reach from a technological perspective. For broadcasting, we seek growth opportunities by increasing the strength and number of our broadcast signals that allows us to reach listeners from our day and night signals. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we acquired or entered into agreements to acquire several FM translators and FM translator construction permits. Construction permits provide authority to construct new FM translators or make changes in our existing facilities. We believe that securing these FM translators and construction permits allows us to increase our audience by providing enhanced coverage and reach in existing AM broadcast markets. FM translators allow our AM stations to be heard on FM and expand the listenership of our FM HD channels with the potential to create new stations using the HD-2, HD-3 and HD-4 channel capacity. We continue to build or purchase websites that allow our audiences to view our content online or through digital streaming. Our digital content is available on numerous iPhone® and Android applications. Each of our radio stations, as well as several of our websites, have iPhone® and Android applications that can be used to view our content or digital streaming on mobile devices.
 
Sales Professionals
 
We have assembled an effective, highly trained sales staff that is responsible for converting our audience share into revenue. We operate a focused, sales-oriented culture that rewards selling efforts through a commission and bonus compensation structure. We hire sales professionals that are capable of selling both integrated and stand-alone advertisements. We provide our sales professionals with the tools and resources necessary to compete effectively in the marketplace. We sell and market our platforms as stand-alone products or in combination with other offerings. Based on our experience, we tailor our platform to meet each advertiser’s needs, including the geographic coverage area, event sponsorships and special features, digital promotions, e-mail sponsorships, and/or print advertisements.
Significant Community Involvement
 
We expect our public image to reflect the lifestyle and viewpoints of the target demographic groups that we serve. We regularly collaborate with organizations that serve Christian and family-themed audiences as well as sponsor and support events that are important to this group. We believe that our ongoing active involvement and our strong relationships within the Christian community provide us with a unique competitive advantage that significantly improves the marketability of our media platform to advertisers and programmers targeting such communities. Our sponsored events include listener rallies, speaking tours, pastor appreciation events and concerts such as our Celebrate Freedom® Music Festivals and Fishfest®. Local events such as these connect us with our audience and enable us to create an enhanced awareness and name recognition in each of our markets. With this involvement, we can increase the effectiveness of developing and improving our programming, which can contribute to a greater audience share and higher ratings over time.
Corporate Structure
 
Management of our operations is largely decentralized with operational vice presidents and general managers located throughout the United States. We believe that this decentralization encourages each general manager and vice president to apply innovative techniques for improving and growing their operations locally in ways that may be transferable to benefit other markets and operations.
 
Our broadcast operations vice presidents, some of whom are also station general managers, are experienced radio broadcasters with expertise in sales, programming, marketing and production. Each of our broadcast operations vice presidents oversees several markets on a regional basis. Our digital and publishing operations vice presidents and general managers are also located throughout the United States in locations in which each of our entities operates.
 
All of our operations receive executive leadership and oversight from our corporate staff. Corporate staff members have experience and expertise in, among other things, accounting and finance, treasury, risk management, insurance, information technology, human resources, legal, engineering, real estate, strategic direction and other support functions designed to provide resources to local management. Corporate staff also oversee the placement and rate negotiations for national block programming on our stations. Centralized oversight of national programming is necessary because several of our key programming partners purchase times in multiple radio markets.

Equity
 
During the year ended December 31, 2016, our Board of Directors declared quarterly equity distributions to all stockholders of record of our Class A and Class B common stock as follows:

Announcement Date | Record Date | Payment Date | Amount Per Share | | Total Cash Distributed (in thousands) | 
------------------+--------------------+--------------------+------------------+--------+---------------------------------------+--
December 7, 2016 | December 19, 2016 | December 31, 2016 | $ | 0.0650 | | $ | 1,678
September 9, 2016 | September 19, 2016 | September 30, 2016 | $ | 0.0650 | | $ | 1,679
June 2, 2016 | June 16, 2016 | June 30, 2016 | $ | 0.0650 | | $ | 1,664
March 10, 2016 | March 22, 2016 | April 5, 2016 | $ | 0.0650 | | $ | 1,657

 
The actual declaration of any future equity distributions and the establishment of the per share amount, record dates, and payment dates are subject to final determination by our Board of Directors and dependent upon future earnings, cash flows, financial and legal requirements, and other factors. The current policy of our Board of Directors is to review all relevant factors on a quarterly basis to determine the appropriate amount, if any, to allocate toward a cash distribution with the general principle of using approximately 20% of Adjusted EBITDA less cash paid for capital expenditures, less cash paid for income taxes, and less cash paid for interest. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure defined in Item 6, Selected Financial Data included in this annual report on Form 10-K.
 
Broadcast Acquisitions
 
We acquired or entered agreements to acquire several FM Translators or FM Translator construction permits during the year. The FCC permits AM and FM radio stations to operate FM Translators. The FCC began an AM Revitalization program, or “AMR,” that included several initiatives intended to benefit AM broadcasters. One of these benefits, intended to promote the use of FM Translators by AM broadcasters, allows an AM station to relocate one FM translator up to 250 miles from its authorized site and operate the translator on any non-reserved band FM channel in the AM station’s market, subject to coverage and interference rules (“250 Mile Window”). On February 23, 2017, the FCC amended its rules to allow an AM station using a rebroadcasting FM translator to locate the FM translator anywhere within the AM station’s daytime service contour or anywhere within a 25-mile radius of the transmitter, even if the contour extends farther than 25 miles from the transmitter. This rule change, when it becomes effective, will be particularly useful for finding a location for these translators.
 
On January 29, 2016, the FCC opened a one-time only 250 Mile Window during which only Class C and Class D AM broadcast stations could participate. This window closed on July 28, 2016. A second window opened on July 29, 2016, allowing Class A and Class B AM broadcast stations to participate in addition to any Class C and Class D AM broadcast station that did not participate in the first 250 Mile Window. The second 250 Mile Window closed on October 31, 2016. During these filing windows, qualifying AM stations were able to apply for one new FM translator station, in the non-reserved FM band to be used solely to re-broadcast the AM station’s AM signal to provide fill-in and/or nighttime service. The FM translator must rebroadcast the related AM station for at least four years, not counting any periods of silence.
 
Construction permits provide authority to construct new FM Translators or make changes in existing facilities. We believe that securing these FM Translators allows us to increase our listening audience by providing enhanced coverage and reach of our existing AM broadcasts that can be heard on FM or expand the listenership of FM HD channels with the potential to create new stations using the HD-2, HD-3 and HD-4 channel capacity.

Radio Stations
 
We own and/or operate 118 radio stations in 40 markets, including 73 stations in 23 of the top 25 markets, consisting of 34 FM radio stations and 84 AM radio stations. We are one of only three commercial radio broadcasters with radio stations in all of the top 10 markets. We are the sixth largest commercial radio broadcaster in the United States as measured by number of radio stations overall and the third largest operator as measured by number of stations in the top 25 markets. We also program the Family Talk™ Christian-themed talk format station on SiriusXM Channel 131.
 
Our five main formats are (1) Christian Teaching and Talk, (2) News Talk, (3) Contemporary Christian Music, (4) Spanish Language Christian Teaching and Talk and (5) Business.
 
Christian Teaching and Talk. We currently program 40 of our radio stations in our foundational format, Christian Teaching and Talk, which is talk programming emphasizing Christian and family themes. Through this format, a listener can hear Bible teachings and sermons, as well as gain insight to questions related to daily life, such as raising children or religious legal rights in education and in the workplace. This format uses block programming time to offer a learning resource and a source of personal support for listeners. Listeners often contact our programmers to ask questions, obtain materials on a subject matter or receive study guides based on what they have learned on the radio.
Block Programming. We sell blocks of airtime on our Christian Teaching and Talk format stations to a variety of national and local religious and charitable organizations that we believe create compelling radio programs. Historically, more than 95% of these religious and charitable organizations renew their annual programming relationships with us. Based on our historical renewal rates, we believe that block programming provides a steady and consistent source of revenue and cash flows. Our top ten programmers have remained relatively constant and average more than 30 years on-air. Over the last five years, block programming revenue has generated 40% to 43% of our total net broadcast revenue.
Satellite Radio. We program SiriusXM Channel 131, the exclusive Christian Teaching and Talk channel on SiriusXM, reaching the entire nation 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

News Talk. We currently program 32 of our radio stations in a News Talk format. Our research shows that our News Talk format is highly complementary to our core Christian Teaching and Talk format. As programmed by Salem, both of these formats express conservative views and family values. Our News Talk format also provides for the opportunity to leverage syndicated talk programming produced by SRN to radio stations throughout the United States. Syndication of our programs allows Salem to reach audiences in markets in which we do not own or operate radio stations.
 
Contemporary Christian Music. We currently program 13 radio stations in a Contemporary Christian Music (“CCM”) format, branded The FISH® in most markets. Through the CCM format, we are able to bring listeners the words of inspirational recording artists, set to upbeat contemporary music. Our music format, branded “Safe for the Whole Family®”, features sounds that listeners of all ages can enjoy and lyrics that can be appreciated. The CCM genre continues to be popular. We believe that the listener base for CCM is underserved in terms of radio coverage, particularly in larger markets, and that our stations fill an otherwise void area in listener choices.
 
Spanish Language Christian Teaching and Talk. We currently program eight of our radio stations in a Spanish Language Christian Teaching and Talk format. This format is similar to our core Christian Teaching and Talk format in that it broadcasts biblical and family-themed programming, but the programming is specifically tailored for Spanish-speaking audiences. Additionally, block programming on our Spanish Language Christian Teaching and Talk stations is primarily local while Christian Teaching and Talk stations are primarily national.
Business. We currently program 13 of our radio stations in a business format. Our business format features financial commentators, business talk, and nationally recognized Bloomberg programming. The business format operates similar to our Christian Teaching and Talk format in that it features long-form block programming.

Revenues generated from each of our radio stations, networks, e-commerce sites for on-air host materials, advertising firms and radio station websites, including banner and digital advertisements are reported as broadcast revenue in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K. Our broadcasting revenue includes radio advertising or spot revenue, programming revenue, e-commerce sales of content created by our on-air hosts, event revenue, digital revenue from station websites and email blasts, and network advertising revenue. The principal source of our network revenue is from the sale of advertising time. Our e-commerce sites that generate broadcast revenues include the following:
 

· | SRNStore.com
--+-------------


· | Salem Consumer Products
--+------------------------

Advertising Revenue. We recognize advertising and commission revenue from radio stations as the spots air or are delivered. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we derived 31.7% of our net broadcast revenue, or $64.0 million, from the sale of local spot advertising and 6.6% of our net broadcast revenue, or $13.4 million, from the sale of national spot advertising.
 
12

 

Programming Revenue. We recognize programming revenue as the programs air. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we derived 24.4% and 18.3% of our net broadcast revenue, or $49.3 million and $37.0 million, respectively, from the sale of national and local block programming time, respectively. We derive national program revenue primarily from geographically diverse, well-established non-profit religious and educational organizations that purchase time on our stations in a large number of markets in the United States. National program producers typically purchase 121/2, 25 or 50-minute blocks of time on a Monday through Friday basis and may offer supplemental programming for weekend release. We obtain local program revenue from community organizations and churches that typically purchase blocks for weekend releases and from local speakers who purchase daily releases. We believe that our management team is successful in identifying and assisting quality local programs expand into national syndication.
 
Network Revenue. SRN’s net revenue, including commission revenue for SMR, for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $17.7 million, or 8.8% of net broadcast revenue.

COMPETITION
 
We operate in a highly competitive broadcast and media business. We compete for audiences, advertisers and programmers with other radio broadcasters, broadcast and cable television operators, newspapers and magazines, book publishers, national and local digital services, outdoor advertising, direct mail, online marketing and media companies, social media platforms, web-based blogs, and mobile devices.
BROADCASTING. Our broadcast audience ratings and market shares are subject to change, and any change in a particular market could have a material adverse effect on the revenue of our stations located in that market. While we already compete in some of our markets with stations that offer similar formats, if another radio station were to convert its programming to a format similar to one of ours, or if an existing competitor were to strengthen its operations, our stations could suffer reduced ratings and/or reduced revenues. In these circumstances, we could also incur significantly higher promotional and other related expenses. We cannot assure that our stations will maintain or increase their current audience ratings and revenues.
 
We compete for advertising revenue with other commercial religious format stations as well as general format radio stations. Our competition for advertising dollars includes other radio stations as well as broadcast television, cable television, newspapers, magazines, direct mail, online and billboard advertising, some of which may be controlled by horizontally integrated companies. Several factors can materially affect competitive advantage, including, but not limited to audience ratings, program content, management talent and expertise, sales talent and experience, audience characteristics, signal strength, and the number and characteristics of other radio stations in the same market.
 
Christian and Family-Themed Radio. The segment of this industry that focuses on Christian and family themes is also a highly competitive business. The financial success of each of our radio stations that focuses on Christian Teaching and Talk is dependent, to a significant degree, upon its ability to generate revenue from the sale of block program time to national and local religious and educational organizations. We compete for this program revenue with a number of different commercial and non-commercial radio station licensees. While we believe that no commercial group owner in the United States specializing in Christian and family-themed programming approaches Salem in size of potential listening audience and presence in major markets, other religious radio stations exist and enjoy varying degrees of prominence and success in each of our markets.
 
New Methods of Content Delivery. Competition also comes from new media technologies and services. These include delivery of audio programming by cable television and satellite systems, digital audio radio services, mobile devices including smart phone applications for iPhone® and Android®, personal communications services and the service of low powered, limited coverage FM radio stations authorized by the FCC. The delivery of live and stored audio programming through the Internet has also created new competition. In addition, satellite delivered digital audio radio, which delivers multiple audio programming formats to national audiences, has created competition. We have attempted to address these existing and potential competitive threats through a more active strategy to acquire and integrate new electronic communications formats including Internet acquisitions made by SWN and our exclusive arrangement to provide Christian and family-themed talk on SiriusXM, a satellite digital audio radio service.
 
15

 

NETWORK. SRN competes with other commercial radio networks that offer news and talk programming to religious and general format stations and noncommercial networks that offer Christian music formats. SRN also competes with other radio networks for the services of talk show personalities.
 
DIGITAL MEDIA. Salem Web Network™ and Townhall Media compete for visitors and advertisers with other companies that deliver online audio programming and Christian and conservative web-based content as well as providers of general market websites. The online media and distribution business changes quickly and is highly competitive. We compete to attract and maintain interactions with advertisers, consumers, content creators and web publishers. Salem Church Products competes for customers with other online sites that offer resources useful in ministries, preaching, teaching and for employment within the Christian community. Our wellness products compete in a large, highly fragmented industry that includes specialty retailers, supermarkets, drugstores, mass merchants, multi-level marketing organizations, mail-order companies, other online retailers and pharmaceuticals.
 
PUBLISHING. Regnery Publishing competes with other book publishers for readers and book sales as well as competes for product quality, customer service, suitability of format and subject matter, author reputation, price, timely availability of both new titles and revisions of existing books, digital availability of published products, and timely delivery of products to customers. Print magazines compete for readers and advertisers with other print publications, including those that also address themes of interest to church leadership and the Christian audience. Salem Author Services, comprised of Xulon Press™ and Hillcrest Media competes for authors with other on-demand publishers including those focused exclusively on Christian book publishers.
Federal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting
 
Introduction. The ownership, operation and sale of broadcast stations, including those licensed to Salem, are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC, which acts under authority derived from The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the “Communications Act”). Among other things, the FCC assigns frequency bands for broadcasting; determines whether to approve certain changes in ownership or control of station licenses; regulates transmission facilities, including power employed, antenna and tower heights, and location of transmission facilities; adopts and implements regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership, operation and employment practices of stations; and has the power to impose penalties for violations of its rules under the Communications Act.
 
The following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act and of specific FCC regulations and policies. Failure to observe these or other rules and policies can result in the imposition of various sanctions, including monetary forfeitures, the grant of “short” (less than the maximum) license renewal terms or, for particularly egregious violations, the denial of a license renewal application, the revocation of a license or the denial of FCC consent to acquire additional broadcast properties. For further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of broadcast stations you should refer to the Communications Act, FCC rules and the public notices and rulings of the FCC.
 
License Grant and Renewal. Radio broadcast licenses are granted for maximum terms of eight years. Licenses must be renewed through an application to the FCC. Under the Communications Act, the FCC will renew a broadcast license if it finds that the station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity, that there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or the rules and regulations of the FCC, and that there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or the rules and regulations of the FCC that, when taken together, would constitute a pattern of abuse.
 
Petitions to deny license renewals can be filed by certain interested parties, including members of the public in a station’s market. Such petitions may raise various issues before the FCC. The FCC is required to hold hearings on renewal applications if the FCC is unable to determine that renewal of a license would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity, or if a petition to deny raises a “substantial and material question of fact” as to whether the grant of the renewal application would be prima facie inconsistent with the public interest, convenience and necessity. In addition, during certain periods when a renewal application is pending, the transferability of the applicant’s license is restricted.
 
The following table sets forth information with respect to each of our radio stations for which we hold the license. Stations that we operate under an LMA or TBA are not reflected on this table. A broadcast station’s market may be different from its community of license. The coverage of an AM radio station is chiefly a function of the power of the radio station’s transmitter, less dissipative power losses and any directional antenna adjustments. For FM radio stations, signal coverage area is chiefly a function of the Effective Radiated Power (“ERP”) of the radio station’s antenna and the Height Above Average Terrain (“HAAT”) of the radio station’s antenna.

Radio station KNTS-AM is an expanded band station paired with station KLFE-AM in the Seattle, WA market, and station KBJD-AM is an expanded band station paired with KRKS-AM in the Denver, CO market. We are operating these four stations pursuant to FCC licenses or other FCC authority pending resolution by the FCC of the issue of AM expanded band dual operating authority. Depending upon how the FCC resolves that issue, it is possible that we will be required to surrender one station license in each station pair. Except for these stations, we are not currently aware of any facts that would prevent the timely renewal of our licenses to operate our radio stations, although there can be no assurance that our licenses will be renewed.

Ownership Matters. The Communications Act prohibits the assignment of a broadcast license or the transfer of control of a broadcast license without the prior approval of the FCC. In determining whether to assign, transfer, grant or renew a broadcast license, the FCC considers a number of factors pertaining to the licensee, including compliance with various rules limiting common ownership of media properties, the “character” of the licensee and those persons holding “attributable” interests therein, and compliance with the Communications Act’s limitation on alien ownership, as well as compliance with other FCC policies, including equal employment opportunity requirements.
 
19

 

Under the Communications Act, a broadcast license may not be granted to or held by a corporation that has more than one-fifth of its capital stock owned or voted by aliens or their representatives, by foreign governments or their representatives, or by non-U.S. corporations. Under the Communications Act, there are limitations on the licensee of a broadcast license, that is held by any corporation that is controlled, directly or indirectly, by any other corporation more than one-fourth of whose capital stock is owned or voted by aliens or their representatives, by foreign governments or their representatives, or by non-U.S. corporations. These restrictions apply in modified form to other forms of business organizations, including partnerships. We therefore may be restricted from having more than one-fourth of our stock owned or voted by aliens, foreign governments or non-U.S. corporations, although the FCC has recently adopted streamlined waiver procedures for requests to exceed the statutory limits.
 
Multiple Ownership: The Communications Act and FCC rules also generally restrict the common ownership, operation or control of radio broadcast stations serving the same local market, of a radio broadcast station and a television broadcast station serving the same local market, and of a radio broadcast station and a daily newspaper serving the same local market. The FCC also restricts the number of television stations an entity may own both in local markets and nationwide.
 
Our current ownership of radio broadcast stations complies with the FCC’s multiple ownership rules; however, these rules may limit the number of additional stations that we may acquire in the future in certain of our markets and could limit the potential buyers of any stations we may attempt to sell. The FCC is also required by the Communications Act to review its broadcast ownership rules every four years. During 2009, the FCC held a series of hearings designed to evaluate possible changes to its rules. In May 2010, the FCC formally initiated its 2010 quadrennial review of its media ownership rules with the issuance of a Notice of Inquiry (“NOI”). The NOI was intended to assist the Commission in establishing a framework within which to analyze whether its media ownership rules remain “necessary in the public interest as a result of competition,” due to the dramatic changes occurring in the media marketplace. Numerous parties filed comments and reply comments in response to the NOI. In June and July 2011, the FCC released to the public eleven economic studies related to its media ownership rules. In December 2011, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPRM”) seeking comment on proposed rule changes in connection with the 2010 quadrennial review. In March 2014, the FCC issued a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“FNPRM”) seeking comment on specific proposed changes to its ownership rules in connection with the 2010 and 2014 quadrennial reviews of the broadcast ownership rules and consolidated its 2010 quadrennial review with the 2014 quadrennial review of the ownership rules. On August 25, 2016, the FCC released a Second Report and Order to close the 2010 and 2014 Quadrennial Review proceedings. The FCC decided to retain its local radio ownership rules without modification. The FCC, however, recently filed a motion requesting that the Third Circuit Court of Appeals hold in abeyance the consolidated cases pending before it in connection with the broadcast ownership rules, because it intends to act on a Petition for Reconsideration of the Second Report and Order, which could result in changes to the local radio ownership rules. We can make no determination as to what effect, if any, any such rule changes will have on us.
 
Attribution: Because of these multiple and cross-ownership rules, a purchaser of voting stock of the company that acquires an “attributable” interest in the company may violate the FCC’s rule if it also has an attributable interest in other television or radio stations, or in daily newspapers, depending on the number and location of those radio or television stations or daily newspapers. Such a purchaser also may be restricted in the other companies in which it may invest, to the extent that these investments give rise to an attributable interest. If an attributable stockholder of the company violates any of these ownership rules, the company may be unable to obtain from the FCC one or more authorizations needed to conduct its radio station business and may be unable to obtain FCC consents for certain future acquisitions.
 
The FCC generally applies its television/radio/newspaper cross-ownership rules and its broadcast multiple ownership rules by considering the “attributable,” or cognizable, interests held by a person or entity. A person or entity can have an interest in a radio station, television station or daily newspaper by being an officer, director, partner, member, or stockholder of a company that owns that station or newspaper. Whether that interest is cognizable under the FCC’s ownership rules is determined by the FCC’s attribution rules. If an interest is attributable, the FCC treats the person or entity who holds that interest as an “owner” of the radio station, television station or daily newspaper in question, and therefore subject to the FCC’s ownership rules. On December 22, 2011, the FCC issued an NPRM to seek comment on specific proposed changes to its ownership rules. In the NPRM, the FCC tentatively concluded to maintain its local radio ownership rules largely intact. Comments and Reply Comments have been received by the FCC in connection with the NPRM (2010 quadrennial review). In March 2014, the FCC issued an FNPRM seeking comment on specific proposed changes to its ownership rules in connection with the 2010 and 2014 quadrennial reviews of the broadcast ownership rules. On August 25, 2016, the FCC released a Second Report and Order to close the 2010 and 2014 Quadrennial Review proceedings. In the Second Report and Order, the FCC readopted its Television Joint Sales Agreement (JSA) Attribution Rule adopted in the Report and Order in this proceeding, which makes certain television JSAs attributable. No other changes were made to the attribution rules.

Proposed Changes. As noted above, in May 2010, the FCC formally initiated its 2010 quadrennial review of its media ownership rules with the issuance of a NOI. The NOI is intended to assist the Commission in establishing a framework within which to analyze whether its media ownership rules remain “necessary in the public interest as a result of competition,” due to the dramatic changes occurring in the media marketplace. Numerous parties have filed comments and reply comments in response to the NOI. In June and July 2011, the FCC released to the public eleven economic studies related to its media ownership rules. On December 22, 2011, the FCC issued an NPRM in the 2010 quadrennial review to seek comment on specific proposed changes to its ownership rules. In the 2010 quadrennial review NPRM, the FCC tentatively concluded to maintain its local radio ownership rules largely intact. Comments and Reply Comments were received by the FCC in connection with the NPRM. In March 2014, the FCC issued an FNPRM seeking comment on specific proposed changes to its ownership rules in connection with the 2010 and 2014 quadrennial reviews of the broadcast ownership rules and consolidated its 2010 quadrennial review with the 2014 quadrennial review of the ownership rules. On August 25, 2016, the FCC released a Second Report and Order to close the 2010 and 2014 Quadrennial Review proceedings. The FCC decided to retain its local radio ownership rules without modification. The FCC, however, recently filed a motion requesting that the Third Circuit Court of Appeals hold in abeyance the consolidated cases pending before it in connection with the broadcast ownership rules, because it intends to act on a Petition for Reconsideration of the Second Report and Order, which could result in changes to the local radio ownership rules. We can make no determination as to what effect, if any, such changes might have on us.
Federal Antitrust Considerations. The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the Department of Justice (“DOJ”), which evaluate transactions to determine whether those transactions should be challenged under the federal antitrust laws, are also active in their review of radio station acquisitions, particularly where an operator proposes to acquire additional stations in its existing markets.
 
For an acquisition meeting certain size thresholds, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Improvements Act (“HSR Act”) and the rules promulgated thereunder require the parties to file Notification and Report Forms with the FTC and the DOJ and to observe specified waiting period requirements before consummating the acquisition. At any time before or after the consummation of a proposed acquisition, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws, as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the acquisition or seeking divestiture of the business acquired or other assets of the company. The FTC or the DOJ may investigate acquisitions that are not required to be reported under the HSR Act under the antitrust laws before or after consummation. In addition, private parties may under certain circumstances bring legal action to challenge an acquisition under the antitrust laws. The DOJ also has stated publicly that it believes that LMAs and other similar agreements customarily entered into in connection with radio station transfers prior to the expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act could violate the HSR Act.
 
We can provide no assurances that our acquisition strategy will not be adversely affected in any material respect by antitrust reviews.
 
GEOGRAPHIC FINANCIAL INFORMATION
 
Our advertisers and programmers are based in various locations throughout the United States. While no one customer or programmer accounts for 10% or more of our revenues, individually or in the aggregate, our broadcast operating segment is particularly dependent on advertising revenue generated from our Los Angeles and Dallas broadcast markets. Our Los Angeles radio stations generated 15.1% of our total net broadcasting advertising revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, 14.7% of our total net broadcasting advertising revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 14.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our Dallas radio stations generated 20.8% of our total net broadcasting advertising revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, 24.5% of our total net broadcasting advertising revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 24.0% for the year ended December 31, 2014.
 
Because substantial portions of our broadcast advertising revenues are derived from our Los Angeles and Dallas markets, our ability to generate revenues in those markets could be adversely affected by local or regional economic downturns in these areas.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
As of February 2, 2017, we employed 1,590 employees of which 1,214 are full time and 376 are part time. These employees consist of 1,153 employees in radio broadcasting, 181 employees in digital media entities, 136 employees in publishing, and 120 corporate employees. We consider our relations with our employees to be good and none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
 
We employ on-air personalities and we may enter into employment agreements with these on-air personalities in order to protect our interests in these relationships. However, on-air talent may be lost to competitors for a variety of reasons. While we do not believe that the loss of any one of our on-air personalities would have a material and adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations, the loss of several key on-air personalities combined could have a material and adverse effect on our business.
