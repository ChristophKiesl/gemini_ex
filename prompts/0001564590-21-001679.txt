Background
 Information contained in this report concerning the electric power supply industry and the Distributed Generation market, the Distributed Hydrogen market, the energy storage market and the Carbon Capture market, our general expectations concerning these industries and markets, and our position within these industries and markets are based on market research, industry publications, other publicly available information and assumptions made by us based on this information and our knowledge of these industries and markets, which we believe to be reasonable. Although we believe that the market research, industry publications and other publicly available information, including the sources that we cite in this report, are reliable, they have not been independently verified by us and, 
 7
 

accordingly, we cannot assure you that such information is accurate in all material respects. Our estimates, particularly as they relate to our general expectations concerning the electric power supply industry and the Distributed Generation market, the Distributed Hydrogen market, the energy storage market and the Carbon Capture market, involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed under Item 1A - Risk Factors of this report.
 As used in this report, all degrees refer to Fahrenheit (“F”); kilowatt (“kW”) and megawatt (“MW”) numbers designate nominal or rated capacity of the referenced power plant; “efficiency” or “electrical efficiency” means the ratio of the electrical energy generated in the conversion of a fuel to the total energy contained in the fuel (lower heating value, the standard for power plant generation, assumes the water in the product is in vapor form; as opposed to higher heating value, which assumes the water in the product is in liquid form, net of parasitic load); kW means 1,000 watts; MW means 1,000,000 watts; “kilowatt hour” (“kWh”) is equal to 1kW of power supplied to or taken from an electric circuit steadily for one hour; and one British Thermal Unit (“Btu”) is equal to the amount of heat necessary to raise one pound of pure water from 59oF to 60oF at a specified constant pressure.
 All dollar amounts are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.
 
Additional Technical Terms and Definitions 
 
Advanced Technologies - Advanced Technologies projects involve the development of new products or applications based on existing carbonate or solid oxide technologies or new electrochemical technologies. Examples are Carbon Capture, Distributed Hydrogen, Solid Oxide Fuel Cells and Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell technologies. Advanced Technologies projects are typically externally funded by government or private sources and executed by our Advanced Technologies Group.
 Availability - A measure of the amount of time a system is available to operate, as a fraction of total calendar time. For power generation equipment, an industry standard (IEEE (The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) 762, “Definitions for Use in Reporting Electric Generating Unit Reliability, Availability and Productivity”) is used to compute Availability. “Availability percentage” is calculated as total period hours since Commercial Operations Date less hours not producing electricity due to planned and unplanned maintenance divided by total period hours. Grid disturbances, force majeure events and site-specific issues such as a lack of available fuel supply or customer infrastructure repair do not penalize the calculation of Availability according to this standard.
 Carbonate Fuel Cell - Carbonate Fuel Cells, such as the fuel cell power plants produced and sold by FuelCell Energy, are high-temperature fuel cells that use an electrolyte composed of a carbonate salt mixture suspended in a porous, chemically inert ceramic-based matrix. Carbonate Fuel Cells operate at high temperatures, enabling the use of a nickel-based catalyst, a lower cost alternative to precious metal catalysts used in some other fuel cell technologies.
 Carbon Capture – The process of extracting dilute carbon dioxide from the flue gas exhaust of fossil or Biogas fueled power plants or thermal processes and purifying the carbon dioxide to the purity required for sequestration or utilization.  Carbon Capture is conventionally done using absorption systems that require energy to produce high purity carbon dioxide.  Carbon Capture can also be done with Carbonate Fuel Cell systems while they produce power.  To our knowledge, this ability to capture carbon dioxide from a power plant or boiler while producing additional power is unique to Carbonate Fuel Cell systems.
 Carbon Separation – The process of extracting carbon dioxide from a Carbonate Fuel Cell system or Solid Oxide Fuel Cell system to reduce or eliminate carbon dioxide emissions.  Carbon Separation does not involve carbon dioxide from an external source, as in Carbon Capture, but is the extraction and purification of carbon dioxide produced internally by the fuel cell from a fossil or Biogas fuel. Extracted carbon dioxide can be sequestered or used in industrial or food and beverage applications.
 Combined Heat & Power - A power plant configuration or mode of operation featuring simultaneous on-site generation from the same unit of fuel of both electricity and heat with the heat used to produce steam, hot water or heated air for both heating and cooling applications.
 Commercial Operations Date - The date that testing and commissioning of a fuel cell project is completed, and the fuel cell power plant is operational with power being generated and sold to the end-user.
 8
 

Distributed Generation - Electric power that is generated where it is needed (distributed throughout the power grid) rather than from a central location. Centrally generated power requires extensive transmission networks that require maintenance and experience efficiency losses during transmission while Distributed Generation does not. Distributed Generation is typically classified as small to mid-size power plants, typically generating 75 MW or less. Central generation is typically classified as large power plants generating hundreds or even thousands of MW.
 Distributed Hydrogen – Hydrogen that is produced near the end user or users of the hydrogen, rather than from a central location.  Large central hydrogen production plants create emissions in their operations and add cost and additional emissions by needing to deliver the gas over long distances to end users.  Distributed Hydrogen can be provided by Carbonate Fuel Cell based Trigeneration systems or Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell based systems. 
 Hydrogen Based Long Duration Energy Storage – Energy storage involving the production of hydrogen from power by electrolysis, where hydrogen is stored to be used later to produce power.  The storage duration can be extended to long periods of time by providing sufficient hydrogen storage.  High round trip storage efficiency can be achieved if the electrolysis and power generation processes are each high efficiency processes, such as Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell based systems and Solid Oxide Fuel Cell based systems, or systems using Reversible Solid Oxide Fuel Cell stacks that alternate between fuel cell and electrolysis mode.
 Microgrids - Microgrids are localized electric grids that can disconnect from the traditional electric grid to operate autonomously and strengthen grid resiliency. Microgrids can be composed only of SureSource power plants due to their continual power output or combine a variety of power generation types such as fuel cells and solar arrays.
 Nitrogen Oxides (“NOx”) - Generic term for a group of highly reactive gases, all of which contain nitrogen and oxygen in varying amounts. Many of the NOx are colorless and odorless; however, they are a major precursor to smog production and acid rain. One common pollutant, Nitrogen Dioxide, along with particles in the air, can often be seen as a reddish-brown layer over an urban area. NOx form when fuel is burned at high temperatures, as in a combustion process. The primary manmade sources of NOx are motor vehicles, traditional fossil fuel fired electric utility generation, and other industrial, commercial and residential sources that burn fuels.
 Particulate Matter (“PM”) - Solid or liquid particles emitted into the air that are generally caused by the combustion of materials or dust generating activities. Particulate Matter caused by combustion can be harmful to humans as the fine particles of chemicals, acids and metals may get lodged in lung tissue.
 Power Purchase Agreement (“PPA”) - A Power Purchase Agreement is a contract that enables a power user to purchase energy under a long-term contract where the user agrees to pay a predetermined rate for the kilowatt-hours delivered from a power generating asset while avoiding the need to own the equipment and pay the upfront capital cost. The PPA rate is typically fixed (with an escalation clause tied to a consumer price index or similar index) or pegged to a floating index that is on par with or below the current electricity rate being charged by the local utility company. A PPA is typically for a term of 10 to 20 years.
 Reformer / Electrolyzer / Purifier (“REP”) – A system which uses a Carbonate Fuel Cell stack (or stacks) in reverse mode (consuming power instead of producing power) to produce hydrogen by electrolysis simultaneous with production of hydrogen from a hydrocarbon fuel by reforming.  The Carbonate Fuel Cell reactions also purify the hydrogen by transferring carbon dioxide from the hydrogen stream.
 Renewable Biogas or Biogas - Renewable Biogas is fuel produced by biological breakdown of organic material. Biogas is commonly produced in biomass digesters employing bacteria in a heated and controlled oxygen environment. These digesters are typically used at wastewater treatment facilities or food processors to break down solid waste and the Biogas produced is a byproduct of the waste digestion. Biogas can be used as a renewable fuel source for SureSource fuel cell plants located on site where the Biogas is produced with gas cleanup, or it can be processed further to meet pipeline fuel standards and injected into a gas pipeline network, which is termed “Directed Biogas”. Directed Biogas requires additional processing to increase the Btu content of the gas, which increases cost and consumes power. Use of Biogas at the point of production (on-site) is more efficient and more economical. 
 Reversible Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (“RSOFC”) – Reversible Solid Oxide Fuel Cell systems use solid oxide cell stacks that alternate between operation in electrolysis mode (as SOEC stacks) or power generation mode (as SOFC stacks).  The ability to use one stack set for both processes reduces cost in Hydrogen Based Long Duration Energy Storage systems.
 9
 

Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell (“SOEC”) - Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells are electrochemical cells with the same cell and stack structure as Solid Oxide Fuel Cells, but are operated in reverse – instead of producing power from fuel and oxygen, SOEC cells produce hydrogen and oxygen from steam when supplied with power.
 Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (“SOFC”) - Solid Oxide Fuel Cells are electrochemical cells with a non-porous ceramic material as the electrolyte. SOFCs operate at high temperatures (slightly higher than Carbonate Fuel Cells) eliminating the need for costly precious-metal catalysts, thereby reducing cost. Like Carbonate Fuel Cells, the high operating temperature enables internal reforming of the hydrogen rich fuel source. The Solid Oxide Fuel Cell platform can be operated in fuel cell mode (producing power from fuel) or electrolysis mode (producing hydrogen from power) and can alternate between the two.
 Sulfur Oxide (“SOx”) - Sulfur oxide refers to any one of the following: sulfur monoxide, sulfur dioxide (“SO2”) and sulfur trioxide. SO2 is a byproduct of various industrial processes. Coal and petroleum contain sulfur compounds and generate SO2 when burned. SOx compounds are particulate and acid rain precursors.

• | Utility Grid Support: Our SureSource power platforms are scalable, which enables siting multiple fuel cell power plants together in a fuel cell park. Fuel cell parks enable utilities to add clean and continuous multi-megawatt power generation on a very small footprint when and where needed and enhance the resiliency of the electric grid by reducing reliance on large central generation plants and the associated transmission system. Deploying our SureSource power platforms throughout a utility service territory can also help utilities comply with government-mandated clean energy regulations, meet air quality standards, maintain continuous power output and improve grid reliability. Our fuel cells can firm-up the total utility power generation solution when combined with intermittent power generation, such as solar or wind, or less efficient combustion-based equipment that provides peaking or load following power.

• | Microgrid Applications: SureSource platforms can also be configured as a Microgrid, either independently or with other forms of power generation, with the goal of providing continuous power and a seamless transition during times of grid outages. We have multiple installations of our solutions operating within Microgrids, some individually and some with other forms of power generation.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Distributed Hydrogen: SureSource platforms are configurable to deliver on-site hydrogen for transportation, industrial applications, natural gas blending, and repowering combustion-based equipment with zero carbon hydrogen. The SureSource Hydrogen platform utilizes proprietary fuel cells configured to simultaneously generate three value streams — power generation, hydrogen, and thermal energy.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Carbon Utilization: SureSource platforms do not combust fuel, and because fuel and air are reacted separately before mixing, carbon dioxide from the fuel is not initially diluted by air and can be easily extracted from the system for utilization or sequestration, significantly reducing the carbon footprint of the generated power. A few attractive applications for this developing Carbon Separation technology are the on-site production of carbon dioxide for industrial use, production of dry ice/ultra-cold freezing, and use in beverage and food applications.

Our proprietary, patented Carbonate Fuel Cell technology generates electricity directly from a hydrogen-rich fuel, such as natural gas or Renewable Biogas, by reforming the fuel inside the fuel cell to produce the needed hydrogen.  This internal, proprietary “one-step” reforming process results in a simpler, more efficient, and cost-effective energy conversion system compared with external reforming fuel cells.  Additionally, we benefit from multi-fuel capability, 
 14
 

which enables the SureSource platform to leverage the established natural gas infrastructure that is readily available in our existing and target markets, compared to some types of fuel cells that can only operate on high purity hydrogen. In addition, our proprietary gas clean-up skid technology allows us to utilize on-site Biogas as production of on-site Biogas is rapidly growing around the world.  Our fuel-flexible platforms mainly utilize clean natural gas and Renewable Biogas generated by the customer on-site or Directed Biogas generated at a distant location and transported via the existing common carrier gas pipeline networks.  
 Our global SureSource product line is uniformly based on the same Carbonate Fuel Cell technology, and offers the following advantages:  
  
• | Sustainable: Our solutions produce electricity electrochemically − without combustion – which enables siting of the power plants in dense, urban areas with clean air permitting regulations and represents an important public health benefit. Fuel cells also reduce carbon emissions compared to less efficient combustion-based power generation.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Flexible: Our solutions can operate on natural gas, on-site Renewable Biogas, Directed Biogas, flare gas and propane to offer CHP and are scalable to add power incrementally as demand grows. The unique chemistry of our Carbonate Fuel Cells allows them to directly use low Btu on-site Biogas with no reduction in output or efficiency compared to operation on natural gas. We have developed proprietary Biogas cleanup and contaminant monitoring equipment which, combined with the inherent suitability of the Carbonate Fuel Cell chemistry, gives us an advantage in on-site Biogas applications. Our SureSource 1500 and SureSource 3000 power plants are the only fuel cell systems certified to CARB emissions standards under the Distributed Generation Certification Program for operation with on-site Biogas. In addition, we have demonstrated operation of our Carbonate Fuel Cell technology with other fuel sources including coal syngas and propane. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reliable: Our solutions improve power reliability and energy security by lessening reliance on the transmission and distribution infrastructure of the electric grid. Unlike solar and wind power, fuel cells are able to operate continuously regardless of weather, time of day, or geographic location.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Standardized: Our solutions use a standard cell design globally, enabling supply chain volume-based cost reduction, optimal resource utilization and long-life product enhancements.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Attractive Thermal Attributes: In addition to electricity, our standard fuel cell configuration produces high quality thermal energy (approximately 700° F), suitable for heating facilities or water, or steam for industrial processes or for absorption cooling. When configured for CHP, our system efficiencies can potentially reach up to 90%, depending on the application. When configured for Distributed Hydrogen our plants produce hydrogen in addition to power, with an effective efficiency (counting the fuel that would have been used to produce hydrogen conventionally) of up to 80% before considering waste heat utilization, which can raise the total efficiency even higher. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Use of Readily Available Catalyst Material: As our fuel cells operate at approximately 1,100° F, our platform solution has a key advantage afforded high temperature fuel cells, specifically that they do not require the use of precious metal electrodes required by lower temperature fuel cells, such as proton-exchange membrane (“PEM”) fuel cells. As a result, we are able to use less expensive and readily available industrial metals, primarily nickel and stainless steel, as catalysts for our fuel cell components. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Easy to Site: Our fuel cell power platforms are easily sited with a relatively small footprint given the amount of power produced. There is minimal noise produced by the mechanical balance of plant (“BOP”) and a clean emissions profile, making our fuel cell power platforms ideally suited for urban locations and in building suburban applications at or near the point of energy consumption.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Scalable: Our solutions are scalable, providing a cost-effective solution to adding power incrementally as demand grows, such as multi-megawatt fuel cell parks supporting the electric grid and large scale commercial and industrial operations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How Our Patented Fuel Cell Works
  
• | Fuel cells cleanly and efficiently convert chemical energy from hydrogen-rich fuels into electrical power and high-quality heat via an electrochemical process.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The process is highly efficient and emits water rather than pollutants as there is no burning of fuel.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 15
 

 
• | Similar to a battery, a fuel cell is comprised of many individual cells that are grouped together to form a fuel cell stack, but, unlike a battery, a fuel cell will continue producing power from hydrogen or hydrocarbon fuels as long as fuel and oxidant are continuously supplied to it.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | When a hydrogen-rich fuel such as clean natural gas or Renewable Biogas enters the fuel cell stack, it reacts chemically to produce hydrogen and electrochemically with oxygen to produce electric power, heat and water.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FuelCell Energy’s SureSource power platforms are based on Carbonate Fuel Cell technology and FuelCell Energy is advancing its Solid Oxide Fuel Cell technology closer to commercialization.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | To produce electricity, Carbonate Fuel Cells generate hydrogen directly from a fuel source, such as natural gas or Renewable Biogas, via an internal reforming process; this approach, which is patented by FuelCell Energy, is a distinct competitive advantage of Carbonate Fuel Cells. Carbonate Fuel Cells produce power from hydrogen by reacting hydrogen in one electrode to make electrons and oxygen in another electrode to consume electrons. This electron circuit generates the power, and the circuit is completed by carbonate ions that diffuse from the oxygen electrode to the hydrogen electrode. The carbonate ions are converted to carbon dioxide and recycled back to the cathode, where they react to regenerate the carbonate ion. The cell concept is illustrated in the following figure.

 Advantages of Carbonate Fuel Cells
 Fuel cell technologies are generally classified according to the electrolyte used by each fuel cell type. Our SureSource technology utilizes a carbonate electrolyte. Carbonate-based fuel cells are well-suited for megawatt-class applications, offering a number of advantages over other types of fuel cells in our target markets. 
 These advantages include:
 
 
• | The ability of Carbonate Fuel Cells to generate electricity directly from readily available fuels such as natural gas or Renewable Biogas;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lower raw material costs as the high temperature of the fuel cell enables the use of commodity metals rather than precious metals;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Scalability to leverage on-site components to reduce cost;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | High-quality heat suitable for CHP applications; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------

 16
 

 
• | The ability to perform advanced applications, including Carbon Capture and hydrogen production to provide fuel for fuel cell vehicles.

SureSource Attributes, Benefits and Emissions Profile
 Fuel cells are non-combustion devices that directly convert chemical energy in fuel into electricity.  Because fuel cells generate power electrochemically rather than by burning fuels, they are more efficient than combustion-based power sources (and as a result they produce less CO2 per kWh of power generated because they use less fuel), and they produce only trace levels of criteria pollutants (e.g., NOX, SOX, and Particulate Matter).  In addition to the low emissions profile, FuelCell Energy’s fuel cell platforms offer additional benefits such as ease of siting, cogeneration heat, fuel flexibility, and compact footprint.  The following table illustrates our view of some of the key attributes and benefits of our SureSource power plants:
 

Intermittent renewables, such as solar- and wind-based power, offer near zero emissions, but only for a small percentage of time and not reliably. To address capacity needs, solar and wind need to be backed up with conventional power generation, battery storage or, ideally, clean baseload fuel cells. 
 
The high efficiency of our products results in significantly less CO2 per unit of power production compared to the average U.S. fossil fuel power plant, and carbon emissions are reduced even further when configured for CHP applications or biofuels.  When our power platforms are operating on Renewable Biogas, government agencies and regulatory bodies generally classify them as carbon neutral due to the renewable nature of the fuel source.  In addition, we have developed the Carbon Separation feature which can be added to a SureSource power plant, allowing CO2, which would otherwise be emitted to be captured and purified for on site use or sequestration.  
 
The low CO2 emissions and low criteria pollutants from SureSource power plants have a significant impact on sustainability and air quality because they avoid emissions 24 hours a day. The high capacity factor of baseload SureSource platforms maximizes the impact of their environmental benefits. While wind and solar renewable power sources may completely avoid these emissions while operating, they avoid fewer emissions than fuel cells because they operate for fewer hours per day. When wind and solar renewable power sources are not operating, higher emission resources may be required to operate, thus diluting the benefits. Additionally, all renewable power sources have life cycle emissions associated with manufacture and disposal.
 
17
 

The following table and figures illustrate how the high capacity factor of our SureSource solutions, combined with their low emissions, result in more avoided emissions on an annual basis than wind and solar per MW of installed capacity. Avoided emissions are calculated based on how much lower in emissions each source is relative to the grid, and the percentage of time the source operates.
 

Sources for the above tables and figures include:
  
1. | Grid emissions rates for NOX and CO2 are from EPA eGrid 2018, US Average non-baseload rates.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Grid particulate emissions rate is from EPA eGrid PM 2.5 US average for 2018.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Solar and Wind capacity factors are average of range from Lazard LCOE Analysis version 13, November 2019.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Utility scale avoided emissions assumes 5% transmission and distribution losses.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | SureSource estimates are based on Company specifications and estimates.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We are also actively developing other technologies, which are discussed below in the “Advanced Technologies Programs” section.  
 
Advanced Technologies Programs
 Our Advanced Technologies programs, including our Carbon Separation, Carbon Capture, Solid Oxide Fuel Cells, and Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells for hydrogen production and energy storage represent future market, product and revenue opportunities for the Company beyond our current product line. We undertake both privately funded and publicly funded research and development to develop these opportunities, reduce costs, and expand our technology portfolio. One of our Advanced Technologies programs, Distributed Hydrogen, is transitioning from being categorized as Advanced Technologies to being categorized as a commercial product as we execute our first commercial project with Toyota at the Port of Long Beach, California, which will produce hydrogen for the fueling of passenger vehicles and heavy duty trucks while providing power to Toyota’s facilities and the local grid.
 18
 

Our multi-featured power plant platforms can be configured to provide a number of value streams, including clean electricity, high quality usable heat, water and hydrogen suitable for vehicle fueling, industrial purposes or power generation, and to concentrate and separate CO2 from coal, biomass and natural gas fired power plants and industrial applications.  
 Our Advanced Technologies programs are currently focused on commercializing solutions within four strategic areas:
  
1) | Distributed Hydrogen production;
---+---------------------------------


2) | Solid Oxide Fuel Cell for stationary power generation, Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell for electrolysis and long duration energy storage, and Reversible Solid Oxide Fuel Cell for the ability to switch between SOFC and SOEC;
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | Carbon Capture for emissions reduction in traditional fossil fuel fired generation and industrial applications combined with power generation; and
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4) | Carbon Separation for emissions reduction from our fuel cell platforms by extracting and purifying CO2 for sequestration or local use.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Distributed Hydrogen Production - On-site or distributed hydrogen generation, produced cleanly, represents an attractive and expansive market.  Our high temperature fuel cells generate electricity directly from a fuel by reforming the fuel inside the fuel cell to supply hydrogen for the electrical generation process.  We have developed a process by which gas separation technology can be added to our core fuel cell to capture hydrogen that is not used by the electrical generation process, and we refer to this configuration as SureSource HydrogenTM.
 The SureSource Hydrogen product has the potential to be a compelling solution for industrial users of hydrogen and in transportation fueling applications. The 2.3 MW SureSource Hydrogen plant is expected to have a hydrogen output of approximately 1,200 kg per day, in addition to the electricity, thermal energy and water generated by the fuel cell. Hydrogen is typically made from natural gas in large central steam methane reforming (“SMR”) plants. The conventional SMR reforming process involves burning fossil fuel to produce steam and to heat a fuel/steam mixture to a high temperature, which is then passed over a catalyst that converts the methane/water mixture to carbon dioxide and hydrogen.  The need to burn fossil fuel to provide thermal energy for the SMR process produces additional carbon dioxide and criteria pollutant emissions, and SMRs are significant water consumers.  A similar, but environmentally sustainable, process happens in SureSource internal reforming: methane (from natural gas or Biogas) reacts with water to produce hydrogen, but, in the internal reforming process, the water and the heat are byproducts of the fuel cell reaction.  There is no need to burn fuel to supply heat, and there is no need to supply water. In fact, a SureSource Hydrogen plant is designed to be a net water producer, not a water consumer.  When operated on Biogas, SureSource Hydrogen systems produce renewable hydrogen, also known as Green Hydrogen, but, even when fueled with natural gas, they produce hydrogen with a lower carbon and criteria pollutant impact than conventional SMR because of the use of internal heat instead of burning fuel. Adding Carbon Separation or Carbon Capture to the SureSource Hydrogen platform when fueled with natural gas will deliver Blue Hydrogen (i.e., hydrogen produced with Carbon Capture). The following figure illustrates the concept of the SureSource Hydrogen platform and identifies typical applications for Distributed Hydrogen.

Trigeneration Distributed Hydrogen Platform
 SOFC/SOEC/RSOFC and Hydrogen Based Long Duration Energy Storage – We are developing a solution for long duration energy storage using our proprietary solid oxide technology.  Our solid oxide stacks are designed to be capable of alternating between electrolysis and power generation mode.  Instead of producing power from fuel and air, a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell stack in electrolysis mode splits water into hydrogen and oxygen using supplied electricity.  A storage system based on SOFC/SOEC/RSOFC technology will start with stored water, which will be converted to hydrogen during charging by electrolysis in the solid oxide stacks.  The hydrogen will be stored as compressed gas in cylinders, pipelines, or underground, creating the ability to produce a virtually limitless supply.  When discharge power is needed, the stored hydrogen will be sent back to the solid oxide stacks, which react it with air to produce power and to regenerate the water, which will be stored for the next cycle.
 The key aspect of this approach is that the reactant (water) is inexpensive and plentiful, consisting of an initial charge of water that will be regenerated with each discharge cycle.  Except for a small amount of makeup water, the system will operate in closed loop mode without continuous water consumption during electrolysis.  Long duration storage can be achieved by adding water and hydrogen storage capacity, without the need to add excessive amounts of conventional battery reactants (e.g. Lithium, Cobalt, etc.), which have supply constraints for broad adoption and which present disposal challenges.  Long duration energy storage is expected to be required at large scale during time periods ranging from hourly to seasonal in order to manage the forecasted high penetration of intermittent renewable resources globally, and this water/hydrogen based approach of our SOFC/SOEC/RSOFC technology has the potential to be a key enabler of long duration storage.
 SOFC power platform design and manufacturing will be complementary to our carbonate-based megawatt-scale platforms and will afford us the opportunity to leverage our field operating history, our existing expertise in power platform design, fuel processing and high volume manufacturing capabilities, and our existing installation and service infrastructure.  Additionally, the primary market for storage applications is electric utilities, which is a market in which we are already active.   
 The following figure shows the basic reactions of a solid oxide cell in fuel cell power generation mode.  Hydrogen is reacted with oxygen ions at the anode electrodes to produce water and electrons, which flow to the cathode to produce the electrical circuit.  The cathode reaction consumes the electrons and oxygen (from air) and produces oxygen ions which migrate to the anode to complete the circuit.

Schematic of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Reactions
 We perform SOFC/SOEC/RSOFC research and development at our Danbury, Connecticut headquarters, as well as at our dedicated SOFC/SOEC/RSOFC facility in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.  We are working under a variety of awards from the DOE for development and commercialization of both SOFC and SOEC.  Our solid oxide development activities are focused on three applications: power generation from hydrogen or other fuels (SOFC), electrolysis-hydrogen production (SOEC), and Hydrogen Based Long Duration Energy Storage (which is a combination of the first two).  During fiscal year 2019, we conducted our first prototype field test of a 250kW natural gas fueled SOFC power plant at the Clearway Energy Center in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  We are currently operating an advanced electrolysis system in our Danbury, Connecticut headquarters, and during fiscal year 2020, we were awarded funding from the DOE to convert the electrolysis system to a reversible storage facility after the electrolysis testing is complete in late 2021. 
 FuelCell Energy Hydrogen Technologies – Our Distributed Hydrogen Trigeneration platform produces clean power, heat, and hydrogen from natural gas or Biogas near the point of use without water consumption.  We are building the first full scale commercial system for Toyota at the Port of Long Beach for onsite vehicle fueling. Our Solid Oxide Electrolysis technology is expected to produce hydrogen from water and power with high electrical efficiency and have the ability to increase efficiency further by using waste heat. We are currently commissioning a sub scale demonstration of this technology in our Danbury test facility and have been awarded a project to provide a packaged 150 kg/day system for demonstration at Idaho National Laboratory. We have also been developing a hybrid reforming/electrolysis technology which uses Carbonate Fuel Cell stacks in electrolysis mode, combined with in-stack reforming of natural gas or Biogas to produce hydrogen while extracting CO2 from the hydrogen stream. This technology, called Reformer / Electrolysis / Purification, or REP, is particularly amenable to Blue Hydrogen production.  This portfolio of technologies addresses a broad range of applications with the ability to maximize value depending on factors such as fuel availability and cost, power cost, and water consumption concerns.  In addition to these approaches to hydrogen production, our Solid Oxide Fuel Cell platform is capable of power generation with pure hydrogen fuel, and our Carbonate Fuel Cell platforms are capable of operation with a blend of hydrogen and natural gas or Biogas.
 Carbon Capture – Power generation and industrial applications are the source of two-thirds of the world’s carbon emissions. Coal and natural gas are abundant, low-cost resources that are widely used to generate electricity in developed and developing countries, but burning these fuels, as well as burning biomass, results in the emission of criteria pollutants and CO2. Cost effective and efficient Carbon Capture from power generation and industrial applications globally represents a large market because it could enable clean use of all available fuels. The SureSource CaptureTM system is being designed to separate and concentrate CO2 from the flue gases of natural gas, 
 21
 

biomass or coal-fired power plants or industrial facilities as a side reaction that extracts and purifies the CO2 in the flue gas during the power generation process and destroys approximately 70% of NOx emissions during the power generation process. 
 The production of additional power during the Carbon Capture process, as opposed to consuming power, differentiates the SureSource Capture system from other forms of Carbon Capture. This could make the SureSource Capture system more cost effective than other systems which are being considered for Carbon Capture. SureSource Capture systems can be implemented in increments, managing capital outlay to match decarbonization objectives and regulatory requirements.  Since our solution generates a return on capital resulting from the fuel cell's production of electricity rather than an increase in operating expense required by other Carbon Capture technologies, it can extend the life of existing power plants and be economically applied to industrial thermal systems. We have a joint development agreement with EMRE, which was effective as of October 31, 2019, to develop and commercialize this application of our core technology. See additional discussion concerning our relationship with EMRE under the section below entitled “License Agreements and Royalty Income; Relationship with POSCO Energy”. During fiscal year 2020, we completed a Carbon Capture project study with Drax Power Station, the largest single-site renewable power generator in the United Kingdom.
 We believe there are significant market opportunities for Distributed Hydrogen production, Carbon Capture, Solid Oxide Fuel Cell solutions and energy storage that represent potential future revenue opportunities for the Company. The projects described above allow us to leverage third-party resources and funding to accelerate the commercialization and realize the market potential of each of these solutions and virtually eliminate the need to rely on and use limited supply minerals.
 
Carbon Separation – In addition to the ability to capture carbon dioxide from an external source, our platforms have the ability to extract and purify carbon dioxide produced by the fuel cell power generation process. Because the fuel is not pre-mixed with air, the depleted fuel gas leaving the fuel electrode chambers contains the carbon dioxide reaction product before it is diluted with large amounts of air. Our Carbon Separation technology allows carbon dioxide to be easily extracted from this stream and purified to the appropriate level for utilization or sequestration, significantly reducing the carbon footprint of the generated power. This requires a simple modification to the fuel cell module which can be provided with new systems and retrofitted for existing systems.
 One attractive application for this technology is the on-site production of carbon dioxide for use in beverage and food production, in addition to industrial uses. A 1.8 MW SureSource system can produce 20 tons high purity carbon dioxide per day, and the power and carbon dioxide production levels can be optimized (e.g., to produce more power and less carbon dioxide) depending on the needs of the application. The system can also provide more than 2 million Btu/hour of useful thermal energy, offsetting fuel consumption in on-site boilers (if not eliminating the need for on-site boilers) and further avoiding carbon dioxide emissions. Additional beverage, food, and/or industrial carbon can be produced by capturing the carbon emissions from on-site boilers through the carbon concentration and capture capabilities of our platform, reducing the carbon footprint of onsite boilers even further.
 The ability to provide clean power, heat, and useable carbon dioxide is a unique feature profile that we believe is only available with our SureSource platform.  Our systems are modular and scalable, so they can be deployed in a wide variety of applications where on-site carbon dioxide is consumed as a product solution, or carbon dioxide is delivered to multiple nearby consumers. Distributed power and heat generation combined with carbon dioxide production, which has the potential to drive significant reductions in carbon emissions, is a compelling product offering built on our current Carbonate Fuel Cell platform. An illustration of the Carbon Separation application is shown in the following figure, which also shows potential applications for locally produced carbon dioxide.

SureSource Platform with Carbon Separation
 We believe there are significant market opportunities for Distributed Hydrogen production, Solid Oxide Fuel Cell solutions and energy storage, Carbon Capture and Carbon Separation. With Distributed Generation and Carbon Separation available now, and Carbon Capture and Solid Oxide Fuel Cell solutions in advanced stages of development, these platforms represent potential future revenue opportunities for the Company.
 We have historically worked on technology development with various U.S. government departments and agencies, including the DOE, the Department of Defense (“DOD”), the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (“DARPA”), the Office of Naval Research (“ONR”), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (“NASA”). Government funding, principally from the DOE, provided 9%, 6% and 8% of our revenue for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Beyond the DOE programs, the Company intends to prudently invest capital to accelerate SOFC/SOEC/RSOFC commercialization.

 Access to clean, affordable and reliable power has transformed how most of the world lives today. The ability to provide power cleanly and efficiently is taking on greater importance and urgency in many regions of the world. FuelCell Energy’s products and services are specifically designed to deliver such clean, efficient power globally.  
 Central generation and its associated transmission requirements and distribution grid are difficult to site, costly, prone to interruption and generally take many years to permit and build.  Some types of power generation that were widely adopted in the past, such as nuclear and coal power, are no longer welcome in certain regions of the world.  The cost and impact to public health and the environment of pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions impact the siting of new power generation.  The attributes of our SureSource power platforms address these challenges by providing virtually Particulate Matter-free baseload power and, where desired, thermal energy at the point of use in a highly efficient process that is affordable to consumers.

We target distinct markets, including:
  
• | Utilities and independent power producers;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | Industrial and process applications;
--+-------------------------------------


• | Education and health care;
--+---------------------------


• | Data centers and communication;
--+--------------------------------


• | Wastewater treatment;
--+----------------------


• | Government;
--+------------


• | Commercial and hospitality; and
--+--------------------------------


• | Microgrids.
--+------------

 The utilities and independent power producers market is our largest vertical market with customers that include utilities on the East and West coasts of the United States, such as UIL Holdings Corporation, Inc. (owned by Avangrid, Inc.), the Long Island Power Authority (“LIPA”), Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. In Europe, utility customers include E.ON Connecting Energies, one of the largest utilities in the world.  In South Korea, we are contracted to operate and maintain a 20 MW power plant project (comprised of five SureSource 3000 plants) for Korea Southern Power Company (“KOSPO”). 
 Our SureSource power platforms are producing power for a variety of industrial, commercial, municipal and government customers, including manufacturing facilities, pharmaceutical processing facilities, universities, healthcare facilities and wastewater treatment facilities. These institutions desire efficient, clean and continuous power to reduce operating expenses, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and avoid pollutant emissions to meet their sustainability goals, while boosting resiliency and limiting dependence on the distribution grid.  CHP applications further support economic and sustainability initiatives by minimizing or avoiding the use of combustion-based boilers for heat. Our SureSource power platforms are unique in their ability to run on Biogas. 
 With the growing market for anaerobic digestion (the production of Biogas from the breakdown of biodegradable materials in the absence of oxygen) and increasingly stringent regulations regarding air quality, we see a growing market opportunity that is perfectly suited for our fuel cell design. SureSource power platforms operating on Renewable Biogas are an especially compelling value proposition as they convert a waste product into clean electricity and heat, while reducing or eliminating flaring, which addresses certain economic, environmental justice, and sustainability challenges faced by our customers and the communities in which they operate. Biogas is generated by the decay of organic material (i.e., biomass). This decaying organic material releases methane, or Biogas. As a harmful greenhouse gas, Biogas cannot be released directly into the atmosphere. Flaring creates pollutants and wastes this potential fuel source. Capturing and using Biogas as a fuel addresses these challenges and provides a carbon-neutral renewable fuel source. Our patented, proprietary clean-up skid, SureSource TreatmentTM, provides an economical and reliable system for treating Biogas for use on-site at the Biogas production facility.
 Wastewater treatment facilities, food and beverage processors and agricultural operations produce Biogas as a byproduct of their operations. Disposing of this greenhouse gas can be harmful to the environment if released into the atmosphere or flared. Our SureSource power platforms convert this Biogas into electricity and heat efficiently and economically. Wastewater facilities with anaerobic digesters are an attractive market for our SureSource solution including the power platform as well as treatment of the Biogas. Many wastewater treatment plants currently flare Biogas produced in the anaerobic digestion process, emitting NOx, SOx and Particulate Matter into the atmosphere, which does not meet many air quality regulations. Since our fuel cells operate on the Renewable Biogas produced by the wastewater treatment process and the heat is used to support daily operations at the wastewater treatment facility, the overall thermal efficiency of these installations is high, supporting economics and sustainability. In addition, the fuel cell does not emit the harmful NOx, SOx and Particulate Matter that come out of a flare or that would result from the use of traditional combustion-based power generation. On-site Biogas projects are more efficient and more economical than Directed Biogas projects because less gas processing is required compared to the processing needed to get the on-site Biogas to pipeline quality. Also, on-site Biogas projects avoid the potential cost of constructing pipelines if the source of the Biogas is not located near an existing natural gas pipeline.  The unique chemistry of Carbonate Fuel Cells allows them to use low Btu on-site Biogas with no reduction in output or efficiency compared 
 24
 

to operation on natural gas.  We have developed proprietary Biogas cleanup and contaminant monitoring equipment which, combined with the inherent suitability of the Carbonate Fuel Cell chemistry, gives us an advantage in on-site Biogas applications.  Our SureSource 1500 and SureSource 3000 power platforms are the only systems certified to CARB emissions standards under the Distributed Generation Certification Program for operation with on-site Biogas.
 Our fuel cell solutions are also well suited for Microgrid applications, either as the sole source of power generation or integrated with other forms of power generation.  We have fuel cells operating as Microgrids at universities and municipalities, including one university Microgrid owned by Clearway Energy and a municipal-based Microgrid owned by UIL Holdings Corporation, in addition to the Microgrids at the University of California, San Diego and the Santa Rita Jail (as discussed below).  For the municipal-based system owned by UIL Holdings Corporation, under normal operation, the fuel cell supplies power to the grid.  If the grid is disrupted, the fuel cell plant will automatically disconnect from the grid and power a number of critical municipal buildings. Heat from this municipal-based fuel cell platform is used by the local high school. As mentioned below, our fuel cell based Microgrids have continued operating during Public Safety Power Shutoffs events in California.
 Growth and Market Adoption Targets
 We target for expansion and development vertical markets and geographic regions that:
  
• | Benefit from and value clean Distributed Generation;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | Are located where there are high energy costs, poor grid reliability, and/or challenged transmission and distribution lines;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Have a need for Distributed Hydrogen for transportation or industry;

Fuel Cell Power Plant Ownership Structures
 25
 

Historically, in the United States, customers or developers typically purchased our fuel cell power plants outright.  As the size of our fuel cell projects has grown and the availability of project capital has improved, project structures in the U.S. have transitioned to predominantly PPAs.  
 Under a PPA, the utility or end-user of the power commits to purchase power as it is produced for an extended period of time, typically 10-to-20 years.  Examples of customers that have previously entered into PPAs include universities, a pharmaceutical company, hospitals and utilities.  A primary advantage for the customer under a PPA structure is that it does not need to commit its own capital or own a power generating asset, yet it enjoys the benefits of fuel cell power generation.
 The project may be sold to a project investor or retained by the Company.  If the project is sold, revenue from the product sale is recognized, and the Company recognizes revenue separately for the long-term maintenance and service agreement over the term of that agreement.  If the project is retained, electricity, capacity and/or renewable energy credits are recognized monthly over the term of the PPA. We report the financial performance of retained projects as generation revenue and cost of generation revenues.
 Our decision to retain certain projects is based in part on the recurring, predictable cash flows these projects can offer us, the proliferation of PPAs in the industry and the potential access to capital.  Retaining PPAs affords the Company the full benefit of future cash flows under the PPAs, which are higher than if we sell the projects, although it requires more upfront capital investment and financing.  As of October 31, 2020, our operating portfolio of retained projects totaled 32.6 MW with an additional 40.7 MW under development or construction.  
 The Company plans to continue to grow this portfolio prudently and in a balanced manner, while also selling projects to investors when selling presents the best value and opportunity for the Company’s capital or meets the customer’s desired ownership structure. 
 
Levelized Cost of Energy
 Our fuel cell projects deliver power at a rate comparable to pricing from the grid in our targeted markets.  Policy programs that help to support adoption of clean distributed power generation often lead to below-grid pricing.  We measure power costs by calculating the Levelized Cost of Energy (“LCOE”) over the life of the project.  
 There are several primary elements to LCOE for our fuel cell projects, including:
  
• | Capital cost;
--+--------------


• | Operations and maintenance cost; and
--+-------------------------------------


• | Fuel expense.
--+--------------

 Given the level of integration in our business model of manufacturing, installing and operating fuel cell power plants, there are multiple areas and opportunities for cost reductions. We are actively managing and reducing costs in all three LCOE areas as follows: 
  
• | Capital Cost - Capital costs of our projects include costs to source material, manufacture, install, interconnect, finance and complete any on-site application requirements, such as configuring for a Microgrid and/or heating and cooling applications. We have reduced the product cost of our megawatt-class power platforms by more than 60% from the first commercial installation in 2003. We expect to achieve further cost reductions, primarily through higher production volumes and engineering efficiencies, which may be achieved through the application of lean manufacturing techniques and supply chain initiatives.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Operations and Maintenance Cost – Through secure connections, we remotely monitor, operate, and maintain our fuel cell power platforms to optimize performance and meet or exceed expected operating parameters throughout the operational lives of the plants. Operations and maintenance (“O&M”) is a key driver for power plants to deliver on projected electrical output and revenue.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Each model of our SureSource power platforms has a design life of 25 to 30 years. There are two major components of our platforms:
 26
 

 
1. | Our fuel cell modules are currently manufactured with a 7-year cell design life, up from the 5-year design last manufactured in 2018. Thus, for a standard 20-year PPA project, our fuel cell modules are expected to require two replacements, compared to three replacements with the 5-year modules, significantly reducing the O&M and increasing up-time operation.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | The BOP systems, which consist of conventional mechanical and electrical equipment, with a design life of 25 to 30 years, are maintained over the project life.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The price for planned periodic fuel cell stack replacements is included in our long-term service agreements or in the per kWh price of the PPA. 
 We expect to continually drive down the cost of O&M with an expanding fleet, which will leverage our investments in this area.  Additionally, we are continuing to develop fuel cells that have longer useful lives, which is intended to reduce O&M costs by increasing our scheduled module replacement period to greater than seven years.
  
• | Fuel Expense - Our fuel cells directly convert chemical energy (fuel) into electricity, heat, water, and, in certain configurations, other value streams such as high purity hydrogen. Our power plants can operate on a variety of existing and readily available fuels, including pipeline natural gas, delivered liquid natural gas or compressed natural gas, Renewable Biogas, Directed Biogas, propane, and other hydrocarbons such as syngas or blends with hydrogen. Our SureSource power plants deliver electrical efficiencies of 47% for systems targeting CHP applications and 60% for systems targeting electric-only applications, such as grid support and data centers. In a CHP configuration, our plants can deliver even higher system efficiency, depending on the application. Considering utilized waste heat in CHP applications, total efficiency of systems using our power plants is typically 60% to 80% and can be as high as 90%. These efficiencies compare to average U.S. fossil fuel plant generation efficiency of about 40% with grid line losses. Increasing electrical efficiency and reducing fuel costs is a key element of our operating cost reduction efforts and a competitive advantage against traditional combustion-based technologies. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 An important and differentiating factor that benefits fuel cells when comparing LCOE to other forms of power generation is that our solutions provide delivered electricity that minimizes or even avoids the costs of high voltage and distributed transmission. 
 Energy can be produced right at the point of use. 
 When comparing LCOE across different forms of power generation, transmission should be considered.  Power generation far from where the power is used requires transmission, which is a cost to ratepayers, creates risk of system outages, increases cybersecurity attack risk, and is inefficient due to line losses of power in the transmission process. Events, including hurricanes along the Gulf Coast and Puerto Rico, wildfires in California, and significant snow and ice storms in the Northeastern U.S., prove that transmission systems are more vulnerable to storm-related and other interruptions than locally generated energy.  
 California has been affected by Public Safety Power Shutoffs (“PSPS”), a preemptive effort by utility companies in the state to prevent wildfires from being started by electrical equipment during strong and dry wind conditions by shutting off the power to targeted neighborhoods and substations. Two FuelCell Energy platforms, installed in Microgrids and operated by FuelCell Energy, remained operational as part of their respective Microgrids in areas impacted by PSPS. These platforms provided steady, reliable power to the University of California, San Diego and the Santa Rita Jail during a time when over 3 million people were generally without power due to PSPS, demonstrating the value of FuelCell Energy’s Distributed Generation platforms. 
 Producing power near the point of use also facilitates the development of CHP applications, since it is easier to find a user for fuel cell waste heat in distributed applications.  Using waste heat to avoid burning fuel for thermal applications reduces LCOE (by avoiding fuel cost) and avoids additional carbon emissions and criteria pollutants.
 
Manufacturing and Service Facilities
 We operate a 167,000 square-foot manufacturing facility in Torrington, Connecticut where we produce the individual cell packages and assemble the fuel cell modules. This facility also houses our global service center. Our completed modules are conditioned in Torrington and shipped directly to customer sites.  Annual capacity (module 
 27
 

manufacturing, final assembly, testing and conditioning) is 100 MW per year under the Torrington facility’s current configuration when being fully utilized.  The Torrington facility is sized to accommodate eventual annual production capacity of 200 MW per year.
 We design and manufacture the core SureSource fuel cell components that are stacked on top of each other to build a fuel cell stack.  For megawatt-scale power plants, four fuel cell stacks are combined to build a fuel cell module.  To complete the power platform, the fuel cell module or modules are combined with the BOP.  The mechanical BOP processes the incoming fuel such as natural gas or Renewable Biogas and includes various fuel handling and processing equipment such as pipes and blowers. The electrical BOP processes the power generated for use by the customer and includes electrical interface equipment such as an inverter.  The BOP components are either purchased directly from suppliers or the manufacturing is outsourced based on our designs and specifications.  This strategy allows us to leverage our manufacturing capacity, focusing on the critical aspects of the power plant where we have specialized knowledge and expertise and possess extensive intellectual property.  BOP components are shipped directly to a project site and are then assembled with the fuel cell module into a complete power plant.
 The Torrington production and service facility and the Danbury corporate headquarters and research and development facility are ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015 certified and our Field Service operation (which maintains the installed fleet of our platforms) is ISO 9001:2015 certified, reinforcing the tenets of FuelCell Energy’s quality management system and our core values of continual improvement and commitment to quality, environmental stewardship, and customer satisfaction. Sustainability is promoted throughout our organization. We manufacture SureSource products and manage them through end-of-life using environmentally friendly business processes and practices, certified to ISO 14001:2015. We continually strive to improve how we plan and execute across the entire product life cycle. We strive for “cradle-to-cradle” sustainable business practices, incorporating sustainability in our corporate culture. We utilize “Design for Environment” principles in the design, manufacture, installation and servicing of our power platforms. “Design for Environment” principles aim to reduce the overall human health and environmental impact of a product, process or service, when such impacts are considered across the product’s lifecycle. We maintain a chain of custody and responsibility of our SureSource products throughout the product life cycle. When our platforms reach the end of their useful lives, we can refurbish and re-use certain parts and then recycle most of what we cannot re-use. By weight, approximately 93% of the entire power plant can be re-used or recycled at the end of its useful life.
 We have a manufacturing and service facility in Taufkirchen, Germany that has the capability to perform final module assembly for up to 20 MW per year of sub-megawatt fuel cell power platforms to service the fuel cell demand in the European market. Our European service activities are also operated out of this location. Our operations in Europe are certified under both ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015.
 We have a research and development facility in Calgary, Alberta, Canada that is focused on the engineering and development of the Company’s SOFC and SOEC technology. This facility includes equipment for the manufacturing of solid oxide cells and stacks, including advanced automated stack manufacturing processes which have been developed to ensure that the low material cost of the stack is matched with low labor and overhead cost.  The images below show our automated printing line used for solid oxide cells and our robotic cell-stack assembly facility.  The automated system performs the stack build at ~12 seconds per repeat layer, including optical part inspection, cell leak test and thickness measurement, interconnect spot weld and leak test, and part-marking for stack quality assurance.

 Raw Materials and Supplier Relationships
 We use various commercially available raw materials and components to construct a fuel cell module, including nickel and stainless steel, which are key inputs in our manufacturing process. Our fuel cell stack raw materials are sourced from multiple vendors and are not considered precious metals. We have a global integrated supply chain with qualified sources of supply, many of which are located locally in the regions in which we have established manufacturing and service operations including Europe and Asia. While we manufacture the fuel cells in our Torrington facility, the electrical and mechanical BOPs are assembled by and procured from several suppliers. All of our suppliers must undergo a stringent and rigorous qualification process. We continually evaluate and qualify new suppliers as we diversify our supplier base in our pursuit of lower costs and consistent quality. We purchase mechanical and electrical BOP components from third party vendors, based on our own proprietary designs.
 Engineering, Procurement and Construction (“EPC”)
 We provide customers with complete turn-key solutions, including development, engineering, procurement, construction, interconnection and operations for our fuel cell projects.  From an EPC standpoint, we have an extensive history of safe and timely delivery of turn-key projects.  We have developed relationships with many design firms and licensed general contractors and have a repeatable, safe, and efficient execution philosophy that has been successfully demonstrated in numerous jurisdictions, both domestically and abroad, all with an exemplary safety record.  The ability to rapidly and safely execute installations minimizes high-cost construction period financing and can assist customers in certain situations when the Commercial Operations Date is time sensitive.
 
Services and Warranty Agreements
 We offer a comprehensive portfolio of services, including engineering, project management and installation, and long-term operating and maintenance programs, including trained technicians that remotely monitor and operate our platforms around the world, 24 hours a day and 365 days a year.  We directly employ field technicians to service the power platforms and maintain service centers near our customers to support the high Availability of our platforms.  
 For all operating fuel cell platforms not under a PPA, customers purchase long-term service agreements, some of which have terms of up to 20 years. Pricing for service contracts is based upon the value of service assurance and the markets in which we compete and includes all future maintenance and fuel cell module exchanges.  Each model of our SureSource power platform has a design life of 25-to-30 years. The fuel cell modules, with legacy modules having a 5-year cell design life and current production modules having a 7-year cell design life, go through periodic replacement, while the BOP systems, which consist of conventional mechanical and electrical equipment, are maintained over the life of the project.
 Under the typical provisions of both our service agreements and PPAs, we provide services to monitor, operate and maintain power platforms to meet specified performance levels. Operations and maintenance is a key driver for power platforms to deliver their projected revenue and cash flows.  The service aspects of our business model provide a recurring and predictable revenue stream for the Company.  We have committed future production for scheduled fuel cell module exchanges under service agreements and PPAs through the year 2038.  The pricing structure of the service agreements incorporates these scheduled fuel cell module exchanges and the committed nature of this production facilitates our production planning. Many of our PPAs and service agreements include guarantees for system performance, including electrical output and heat rate. Should the power platform not meet the minimum performance levels, we may be required to replace the fuel cell module with a new or used replacement module and/or pay performance penalties.  Our goal is to optimize the power platforms to meet expected operating parameters throughout their contracted service term.
 In addition to our service agreements, we provide a warranty for our products against manufacturing or performance defects for a specific period of time. The warranty term in the U.S. is typically 15 months after shipment or 12 months after acceptance of our products.  We accrue for estimated future warranty costs based on historical experience.

License Agreements and Royalty Income; Relationship with POSCO Energy
 License Agreement with ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company
 EMRE and FuelCell Energy began working together in 2016 under an initial joint development agreement with a focus on better understanding the fundamental science behind Carbonate Fuel Cells for use in advanced applications and specifically how to increase efficiency in separating and concentrating carbon dioxide from the exhaust of natural gas-fueled power generation.
 In June 2019, we entered into a license agreement with EMRE, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ExxonMobil Corporation, to facilitate the further development of our SureSource CaptureTM product (the “EMRE License Agreement”). Pursuant to the EMRE License Agreement, the Company granted EMRE and its affiliates a non-exclusive, worldwide, fully-paid, perpetual, irrevocable, non-transferable license and right to use our patents, data, know-how, improvements, equipment designs, methods, processes and the like to the extent it is useful to research, develop and commercially exploit Carbonate Fuel Cells in applications in which the fuel cells concentrate carbon dioxide from industrial and power sources and for any other purpose attendant thereto or associated therewith, in exchange for a $10 million payment. Such right and license is sublicenseable to third parties performing work for or with EMRE or its affiliates, but shall not otherwise be sublicenseable. 
 The EMRE License Agreement facilitated the execution of a new Joint Development Agreement with EMRE, effective October 31, 2019 and executed in fiscal year 2020 (the “EMRE Joint Development Agreement”), pursuant to which we are continuing exclusive research and development efforts with EMRE to evaluate and develop new and/or improved Carbonate Fuel Cells to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from industrial and power sources, in exchange for (a) payment of (i) an exclusivity and technology access fee of $5.0 million, (ii) up to $45.0 million for research and development efforts, and (iii) milestone-based payments of up to $10.0 million after certain technological milestones are met, and (b) certain licenses.  As a result of the execution of the EMRE Joint Development Agreement in fiscal year 2020, the associated backlog was recorded in fiscal year 2020 and the related revenue is expected to be recognized through fiscal year 2021.
 License Agreements with POSCO Energy
 From approximately 2007 through 2015, we relied on POSCO Energy to develop and grow the South Korean and Asian markets for our products and services.  
 Through June of 2020, we recorded license fees and were entitled to receive royalty income from POSCO Energy pursuant to manufacturing and technology transfer agreements entered into with POSCO Energy, including the Alliance Agreement dated February 7, 2007 (and amendments thereto), the Technology Transfer, License and Distribution Agreement dated February 7, 2007 (and amendments thereto), the Stack Technology Transfer and License Agreement dated October 27, 2009 (and amendments thereto), and the Cell Technology Transfer and License Agreement dated October 31, 2012 (and amendments thereto) (collectively, the “License Agreements”). The Cell Technology Transfer and License Agreement (“CTTA”) provided POSCO Energy with the exclusive technology rights to manufacture, sell, distribute and service our SureSource 300, SureSource 1500 and SureSource 3000 fuel cell technology in the South Korean and broader Asian markets. POSCO Energy built a cell manufacturing facility in Pohang, South Korea which became operational in late 2015, but is no longer operating.
 In October 2016, the Company and POSCO Energy extended the terms of certain of the License Agreements to be consistent with the term of the CTTA, which was to expire on October 31, 2027. The CTTA required POSCO Energy to pay us a 3.0% royalty on POSCO Energy net product sales, as well as a royalty on scheduled fuel cell module replacements under service agreements for modules that were built by POSCO Energy and installed at plants in Asia under the terms of long-term service agreements between POSCO Energy and its customers. Due to certain actions and inactions of POSCO Energy, the Company has not realized any new material revenues, royalties or new projects developed by POSCO Energy since late 2015. 
 In March 2017, we entered into a memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) with POSCO Energy to permit us to directly develop the Asian fuel cell business, including the right for us to sell SureSource solutions in South Korea and the broader Asian market. In June 2018, POSCO Energy advised us in writing that it was terminating the MOU effective July 15, 2018.  Pursuant to the terms of the MOU, notwithstanding its termination, we continued to execute on sales commitments in Asia secured in writing prior to July 15, 2018, including the 20 MW power plant installed for KOSPO. 
 30
 

In November 2019, POSCO Energy spun-off its fuel cell business into a new entity, Korea Fuel Cell Co., Ltd. (“KFC”), without our consent. As part of the spin-off, POSCO Energy transferred manufacturing and service rights under the License Agreements to KFC, but retained distribution rights and severed its own liability under the License Agreements. We formally objected to POSCO Energy’s spin-off, and POSCO Energy posted a bond to secure any liabilities to FuelCell Energy arising out of the spin-off. In September 2020, the Korean Electricity Regulatory Committee found that POSCO Energy’s spin-off of the fuel cell business to KFC may have been done in violation of South Korean law.
 On February 19, 2020, we notified POSCO Energy in writing that it was in material breach of the License Agreements by (i) its actions in connection with the spin-off of the fuel cell business to KFC, (ii) its suspension of performance through its cessation of all sales activities since late 2015 and its abandonment of its fuel cell business in Asia, and (iii) its disclosure of material nonpublic information to third parties and its public pronouncements about the fuel cell business on television and in print media that have caused reputational damage to the fuel cell business, the Company and its products. We also notified POSCO Energy that, under the terms of the License Agreements, it had 60 days to fully cure its breaches to our satisfaction and that failure to so cure would lead to termination of the License Agreements. Further, on March 27, 2020, we notified POSCO Energy of additional instances of its material breach of the License Agreements based on POSCO Energy’s failure to pay royalties required to be paid in connection with certain module replacements.
 On April 27, 2020, POSCO Energy initiated a series of three arbitration demands against us at the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce seated in Singapore alleging certain warranty defects in a sub-megawatt conditioning facility at its facility in Pohang, South Korea and seeking combined damages of approximately $3.3 million. Prior to filing the arbitrations, POSCO Energy obtained provisional attachments from the Seoul Central District Court attaching certain revenues owed to us by KOSPO as part of such warranty claims, which has delayed receipt of certain payments owed to us. POSCO Energy subsequently sought additional provisional attachments on KOSPO revenues from the Seoul Central District Court based on unspecified warranty claims not yet filed in an additional amount of approximately $7 million, and additional provisional attachments on KOSPO revenues from the Seoul Central District Court based on its alleged counterclaims in the license termination arbitration described below in an additional amount of approximately $110 million. As of October 31, 2020, outstanding accounts receivable due from KOSPO were $4.8 million.
 On June 28, 2020, we terminated the License Agreements with POSCO Energy and filed a demand for arbitration against POSCO Energy and KFC in the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce based on POSCO Energy’s (i) failure to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to sell our technology in the South Korean and Asian markets, (ii) disclosure of our proprietary information to third parties, (iii) attack on our stock price and (iv) spin-off of POSCO Energy’s fuel cell business into KFC without our consent. We have requested that the arbitral tribunal (a) confirm through declaration that POSCO Energy’s exclusive license to market our technology and products in South Korea and Asia is null and void as a result of the breaches of the License Agreements and that we have the right to pursue direct sales in these markets, (b) order POSCO Energy and KFC to compensate us for losses and damages suffered in the amount of more than $200 million, and (c) order POSCO Energy and KFC to pay our arbitration costs, including counsel fees and expenses. We have retained outside counsel on a contingency basis to pursue our claims, and outside counsel has entered into an agreement with a litigation finance provider to fund the legal fees and expenses of the arbitration. In October 2020, POSCO Energy filed a counterclaim in the arbitration (x) seeking approximately $880 million in damages based on allegations that we misrepresented the capabilities of our fuel cell technology to induce POSCO Energy to enter into the License Agreements and failed to turn over know-how sufficient for POSCO Energy to successfully operate its business; (y) seeking a declaration that the License Agreements remain in full force and effect and requesting the arbitral tribunal enjoin us from interfering in POSCO Energy’s exclusive rights under the License Agreements and (z) seeking an order that we pay POSCO Energy’s arbitration costs, including counsel fees and expenses.
 On August 28, 2020, POSCO Energy filed a complaint in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the “Court”) purportedly seeking to enforce its rights as a stockholder of the Company to inspect and make copies and extracts of certain books and records of the Company and/or the Company’s subsidiaries pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and/or Delaware common law. POSCO Energy alleges that it is seeking to inspect these documents for a proper purpose reasonably related to its interests as a stockholder of the Company, including investigating whether the Company’s Board of Directors and its management breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty, due care, and good faith. POSCO Energy seeks an order of the Court permitting POSCO Energy to inspect and copy the demanded books and records, awarding POSCO Energy reasonable costs and expenses, 
 31
 

including reasonable attorney’s fees incurred in connection with the matter, and granting such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
On September 14, 2020, POSCO Energy filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that the Company delayed the removal of restrictive legends on certain share certificates held by POSCO Energy in 2018, thus precluding POSCO Energy from selling the shares and resulting in claimed losses in excess of $1,000,000.
 The Company does not believe that any of the arbitrations or legal proceedings brought against the Company by POSCO Energy are for a proper purpose. Further, the Company believes that all such arbitrations and legal proceedings are in fact simply fulfillment of POSCO Energy’s prior threats to file a series of actions against the Company and are attempts to obtain leverage over the Company and, in certain proceedings, gain advantage in the pending arbitration filed by the Company against POSCO Energy. The Company will vigorously defend itself against POSCO Energy’s claims in all forums and believes it will be apparent at the conclusion of each matter that each action was filed for an improper purpose.
 
Company Funded Research and Development
 In addition to research and development performed under research contracts, including as described under the heading “Advanced Technologies Programs” above, we also fund our own research and development activities to support the commercial fleet with product enhancements and improvements. During fiscal year 2018, we launched our seven-year life stacks, which extended our stack life from five years to seven years. Greater power output and improved longevity are expected to lead to improved gross margin profitability on a per-unit basis for each power plant sold and improved profitability of service contracts, which are expected to support expanding gross margins for the Company.
 In addition to output and life enhancements, we designed and introduced the 3.7 MW SureSource 4000 configuration with increased electrical efficiency, and we continually invest in cost reduction and improving the performance, quality and serviceability of our plants. These efforts are intended to improve our value proposition.
 Company-funded research and development is included in Research and development expenses (operating expenses) in our consolidated financial statements.  The total research and development expenditures in the consolidated statement of operations, including third party and Company-funded expenditures, are as follows:

Service and generation backlog as of October 31, 2020 had a weighted average term of approximately 18 years, with weighting based on dollar backlog and utility service contracts of up to 20 years in duration at inception.  Generally, our government funded and privately funded research and development contracts are subject to the risk of termination at the convenience of the contract counterparty.
 Our backlog amount outstanding is not indicative of amounts to be earned in the upcoming fiscal year.  The specific elements of backlog may vary in terms of timing and revenue recognition from less than one year to up to 20 years.  
 The Company may choose to sell or retain operating power plants on the balance sheet, thus creating variability in timing of revenue recognition. Accordingly, the timing and the nature of our business makes it difficult to predict what portion of our backlog will be filled in the next fiscal year.

Competition

Our platforms are based on a range of technologies and target a variety of applications, each of which have incumbent and developing competitors.
 
Our SureSource Carbonate Fuel Cell power plants compete in the marketplace for stationary Distributed Generation fueled by natural gas or Biogas. Several companies in the U.S. are engaged in fuel cell development, although, to our knowledge, we are the only domestic company engaged in manufacturing and deployment of stationary natural gas or Biogas fueled Carbonate Fuel Cells. Other suppliers of stationary fuel cell systems include Doosan Fuel Cell Co. Ltd, which manufactures medium-temperature phosphoric acid fuel cell systems and is developing solid oxide systems, and Bloom Energy, a supplier of solid oxide based systems. Other companies are developing solid oxide systems and other hydrogen-based fuel cell systems for small residential or vehicle auxiliary power units, which are applications we are not pursing. Examples of these developers include Ceres Power Holdings, Ceramic Fuel Cells Ltd, SOLIDPower, Aris Energy, Plug Power, Altergy and Cummins, Inc.  
 
In addition to different types of stationary fuel cells, some other technologies that compete in the Distributed Generation marketplace include micro-turbines, turbines, and reciprocating gas engines. Companies we may compete with that offer this type of equipment include Caterpillar, Cummins, Wartsila, MTU/Rolls Royce, and Detroit Diesel, which manufacture combustion-based distributed power generation equipment, including various engines and turbines, and have established manufacturing and distribution operations along with product operating and cost features. Competition on larger MW projects may also come from gas turbine companies like General Electric, Caterpillar Solar Turbines and Kawasaki.
 33
 

We also compete against the electric grid, which is readily available to prospective customers. The electric grid is supplied by traditional centralized power plants, including coal, gas and nuclear, with transmission lines used to transport the electricity to the point of use. 
 Our stationary fuel cell power plants also compete against large scale solar and wind technologies, although we complement the unreliable intermittent nature of solar and wind power with the continuous, reliable power output of the fuel cells. Solar and wind power require specific geographies and weather profiles, require transmission for utility-scale applications, and require a source of back up capacity for when the sun or wind is not available. They also require a significant amount of land compared to our fuel cell power plants, making it difficult to site megawatt-class solar and wind projects in urban areas, unlike our solutions. While fuel cells emit negligible amounts of NOx, SOx and Particulate Matter, fuel cells do emit some carbon dioxide when fueled with natural gas, but less per kWh compared to other less-efficient systems. In many markets, baseload fuel cells avoid more emissions than wind or solar systems of similar capacity because they operate for many more hours of the day compared to these intermittent resources.
 We are also developing distributed power generation systems based on our Solid Oxide Fuel Cell technology, and these systems will have the same competition described above.
 Our solid oxide systems can operate on pure hydrogen, but we are not developers of hydrogen fueled systems for mobility or material handling applications, such as the PEM-based systems developed by Ballard Power Systems, Plug Power, Toyota, Hyundai, Honda and GM, so we do not compete with these companies for those applications. However, Ballard Power Systems and Plug Power have developed stationary hydrogen fueled systems in the past, and we could compete against some of these developers in the future if a market for hydrogen fueled stationary power generation systems develops.
 In addition to distributed power generation, we are also developing systems for hydrogen production. Our Distributed Hydrogen solution, with co-production of power and hydrogen from natural gas or Biogas, competes against traditional centralized hydrogen generation as well as conventional electrolyzers used for distributed applications. Hydrogen is typically generated at a central location in large quantities by combustion-based steam reforming and is then distributed to end users by diesel truck. As such, centralized hydrogen production systems produce more emissions per kg of hydrogen than our Distributed Hydrogen platform and have added transportation costs and emissions.
 Electrolysis can compete with our Distributed Hydrogen solution if the cost of power is low. Low-cost power reduces the cost of hydrogen produced by electrolysis, and it reduces the revenue from power sales for a Distributed Hydrogen system. In areas with high power cost, the added revenue for the power sales from a Trigeneration Distributed Hydrogen platform reduces the price of hydrogen. Companies providing electrolysis systems for hydrogen production include NEL, ITM Power, Plug Power and Cummins, Inc.
 We are also developing advance electrolysis systems based on our Solid Oxide Electrolysis platform, which can operate at higher electrical efficiency than currently available electrolysis technologies. Applications for this technology include hydrogen for production for mobility or industrial users as well as large scale hydrogen production from curtailed renewable or nuclear power. We will compete with conventional electrolysis providers in these applications but will have the advantage of the higher electrical efficiency and the ability to increase electrical efficiency even higher by using waste heat from industrial systems or nuclear plants. Other companies are also developing solid oxide-based electrolysis systems, including Bloom Energy and Sunfire GmbH.
 
Our Reversible Solid Oxide Fuel Cell technology can also be used in energy storage applications, since our fuel cell stacks can alternate between electrolysis mode (using power to produce hydrogen which is stored) and fuel cell mode (producing power from stored hydrogen). Our competition in this application will be conventional battery energy storage (e.g., lead-acid or lithium) or developing storage systems such as flow batteries. Hydrogen based energy storage offers an advantage for long duration applications because the cost of the reactant (an initial fill of water) is very low. Sunfire GmbH is also developing reversible solid oxide systems, and Bloom Energy has recently discussed hydrogen storage concepts with separate systems for hydrogen production and consumption (i.e., not with reversible stacks).
 
34
 

Our Carbonate Fuel Cell based Carbon Capture solution is unique in that it is the only Carbon Capture approach that, to our knowledge, can capture CO2 from a power plant or boiler while simultaneously producing power. Our competition in this application will be conventional Amine-based absorption systems, and systems under development using solid adsorbents or membrane CO2 separation. All these alternatives have power requirements that will decrease the output of a host power plant or add cost to capture from industrial boilers.  Our co-production of power provides a revenue stream that reduces the cost of Carbon Capture and is unique among the technologies being considered for this application. 
 
Regulatory and Legislative Environment
 Distributed Generation addresses certain power generation issues that central generation does not and legal, government and regulatory policy can impact deployment of Distributed Generation. The policies that affect our products are not always the same as those imposed on our competitors, and while some policies can make our products less competitive, others may provide an advantage. Certain utility policies may also pose barriers to our installation or interconnection with the utility grid, such as backup, standby or departing load charges that make installation of our products not economically attractive for our customers. Regulatory and legislative support encompasses policy, incentive programs, and defined sustainability initiatives such as Renewable Portfolio Standards (“RPS”).
 Various states and municipalities in the U.S. have adopted programs for which our products qualify, including programs supporting self-generation, clean air power generation, combined heat and power applications, carbon reduction, grid resiliency/Microgrids and utility ownership of fuel cell projects.
 
Many states in the U.S. have enacted legislation adopting Clean Energy Standards (“CES”) or RPS mechanisms. Under these standards, regulated utilities and other load serving entities are required to procure a specified percentage of their total electricity sales to end-user customers from eligible resources. CES and RPS legislation and implementing regulations vary significantly from state to state, particularly with respect to the percentage of renewable energy required to achieve the state’s mandate, the definition of eligible clean and renewable energy resources, and the extent to which renewable energy credits (certificates representing the generation of renewable energy) qualify for CES or RPS compliance. Fuel cells using Biogas qualify as renewable power generation technology in all of the CES and RPS states in the U.S., and some states specify that fuel cells operating on natural gas are also eligible for these initiatives in recognition of the high efficiency and low pollutants of fuel cells.  Other states are moving away from generation utilizing fossil fuels in favor of zero carbon resources. 
 
In February 2018, the U.S. Congress reinstated the 30% Investment Tax Credit (“ITC”) for fuel cells and also extended and significantly expanded the existing Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit. The ITC phased down to 26% in 2020 and was scheduled to phase down to 22% by 2022 and expire in 2023. The reinstatement of the ITC for fuel cells provided equal access to tax incentives for U.S. fuel cell manufacturers when compared with other clean energy solutions. The ITC phase down was extended by two years pursuant to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 passed by Congress in December 2020 and signed by the President on December 27, 2020, thus extending the 26% ITC until 2022 and the expiration to 2025. 
 Internationally, South Korea has an RPS to promote clean energy, reduce carbon emissions, and develop local manufacturing of clean energy generation products to accelerate economic growth. The RPS is designed to increase new and renewable power generation to 10% of total power generation by 2023 from 2% when the RPS began in 2012.  Twenty-two of the largest power generators are obligated to achieve the RPS requirements in their generation or purchase offsetting renewable energy certificates.  Financial penalties are levied by the government for non-compliance.  European governments are supportive of hydrogen-based generation and efficient CHP applications, and some European governments such as Germany, the UK and the Netherlands, provide incentives in the form of tax incentives, grants and waivers of regulatory fees for such installations.

Government Regulation
 Our Company and our products are subject to various federal, provincial, state and local laws and regulations relating to, among other things, land use, safe working conditions, handling and disposal of hazardous and potentially hazardous substances and emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere. Negligible emissions of SOx and NOx from our power plants are substantially lower than conventional combustion-based generating stations and are far below existing and proposed regulatory limits. The primary emissions from our power plants, assuming no cogeneration application, are humid flue gas that is discharged at temperatures of 700-800° F, water that is discharged at temperatures of 10-20° F above ambient air temperatures, and CO2 in per kW hour amounts that are much less than conventional fossil fuel central generation power plants due to the high efficiency of fuel cells. The discharge of water from our power plants requires permits that depend on whether the water is to be discharged into a storm drain or into the local wastewater system.
 We are also subject to federal, state, provincial and/or local regulation with respect to, among other things, siting. In addition, utility companies and several states in the U.S. have created and adopted, or are in the process of creating and adopting, interconnection regulations covering both technical and financial requirements for interconnection of fuel cell power plants to utility grids. Our power plants are designed to meet all applicable laws, regulations and industry standards for use in the international markets in which we operate.  Our SureSource solutions are CARB 2007 certified, and our SureSource 1500 and SureSource 3000, when operating on Biogas, are certified for the CARB 2013 Biogas standard. 
 
Proprietary Rights and Licensed Technology
 
Our intellectual property consists of patents, trade secrets and institutional knowledge and know-how that we believe is a competitive advantage and represents a barrier to entry for potential competitors.  Our Company was founded in 1969 as an applied research company and began focusing on Carbonate Fuel Cells in the 1980s, with our first fully-commercialized SureSource power plant sold in 2003. Over this time, we have gained extensive experience in designing, manufacturing, operating and maintaining fuel cell power plants.  This experience cannot be easily or quickly replicated and, combined with our trade secrets, proprietary processes and patents, safeguards our intellectual property rights.
 As of October 31, 2020, we (excluding our subsidiaries) had 102 U.S. patents and 186 patents in other jurisdictions covering our fuel cell technology (in certain cases covering the same technology in multiple jurisdictions), with patents directed to various aspects of our SureSource technology, SOFC technology, PEM fuel cell technology and applications thereof. As of October 31, 2020, we also had 55 patent applications pending in the U.S. and 107 patent applications pending in other jurisdictions. Our U.S. patents will expire between 2020 and 2039, and the current average remaining life of our U.S. patents is approximately 9.5 years. 
 As of October 31, 2020, our subsidiary, Versa Power Systems, Ltd. (“Versa”), had 32 U.S. patents and 93 international patents covering SOFC technology (in certain cases covering the same technology in multiple jurisdictions), with an average remaining U.S. patent life of approximately 4.7 years. As of October 31, 2020, Versa also had 3 pending U.S. patent applications and 14 patent applications pending in other jurisdictions. In addition, as of October 31, 2020, our subsidiary, FuelCell Energy Solutions, GmbH, had license rights to 2 U.S. patents and 7 patents outside the U.S. for Carbonate Fuel Cell technology licensed from Fraunhofer IKTS.
 Five patents expired in 2019 and 6 patents expired in 2020 for FuelCell Energy and Versa, but none of these expirations, individually or in the aggregate, is expected to have any material impact on our current or anticipated operations.  As has historically been the case, we are continually innovating and have a significant number of invention disclosures that we are reviewing that may result in additional patent applications.
 36
 


Certain of our U.S. patents are the result of government-funded research and development programs, including our DOE programs. U.S. patents we own that resulted from government-funded research are subject to the government potentially exercising “march-in” rights. We believe that the likelihood of the U.S. government exercising these rights is remote and would only occur if we ceased our commercialization efforts and there was a compelling national need to use the patents.
 
Significant Customers and Information about Geographic Areas
 
We contract with a concentrated number of customers for the sale of our products and for research and development.

See Item 7 – “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Item 8 – “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further information regarding our revenue and revenue recognition policies.
 
We have marketing and manufacturing operations both within and outside the United States. We source raw materials and BOP components from a diverse global supply chain.  In 2020, the foreign country with the greatest concentration risk was South Korea, accounting for 3% of our consolidated net revenues.  The Company was entitled to receive royalties from POSCO Energy on the sale of power plants and module replacements related to service of fuel cell power plants in Asia, and the Company received approximately $0.4 million in such royalties during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2019 as part of a net settlement of an arbitration brought by POSCO Energy in 2018.  As part of our strategic plan, we are in the process of diversifying our sales mix from both a customer specific and geographic perspective. See Item 1A “Risk Factors” - “The pending legal proceedings with POSCO Energy could expose us to costs of such legal proceedings or an adverse judgment.”

The international nature of our operations subjects us to a number of risks, including fluctuations in exchange rates, adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements and tariffs, taxes, and other trade restrictions. See Item 1A “Risk Factors” – “We are subject to risks inherent in international operations.” See also Note 17. “Segment Information,” to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about our net sales by geographic region for the years ended October 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018. See also Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” for other information about our operations and activities in various geographic regions.
 
Sustainability
 FuelCell Energy’s clean, efficient and reliable fuel cell power platforms assist our customers in achieving their environmental and sustainability goals. Our patented FuelCell Energy products offer a sustainable alternative to traditional internal combustion-based power generation. Traditional power plants create harmful emissions, such as NOx, SOx and Particulate Matter, that are a serious public health concern. Alternatively, the FuelCell Energy power platforms use a combustion-free power generation process that is virtually free of pollutants. Our platforms are highly efficient and environmentally friendly products that support the “Triple Bottom Line” concept of sustainability, consisting of environmental, social and economic considerations. As an enterprise, we are proud that, in October 2018, we were certified ISO 14001:2015 compliant, having demonstrated the establishment of and adherence to an environmental management system standard. We believe that FuelCell Energy is the only fuel cell manufacturer to have received this certification.
 Product efficiency
 The electrical efficiency of our Carbonate Fuel Cell solutions ranges from approximately 47% to 60% depending on the configuration.  When configured for CHP, our system efficiencies can potentially reach up to 90%, depending on the application. This compares favorably to the average efficiency of the U.S. electrical grid of about 40%.  Our solutions deliver this high electrical efficiency where the power is used, avoiding transmission.  Transmission line losses average about 5% for the U.S. grid, which represents inefficiency and is a hidden cost to ratepayers.
 Product end-of-life management
 Our commitment to sustainability is evident in the design, manufacturing, installation and servicing of our fuel cell power platforms, which are engineered for recycling and reuse. We start with a commitment to sustainability best practices as part of our corporate culture, then apply this core belief to the design, manufacture, installation and servicing of our fuel cell power platforms.  For example, when our plants reach the end of their useful lives, we have the capability to refurbish and re-use certain parts and also recycle most of what we cannot re-use.  This is a departure from other power generation methods that typically produce a significant amount of waste. The BOP has an operating life of 25-to-30 years, at which time metals such as steel and copper are reclaimed for scrap value. For context, by weight, approximately 93% of the entire power plant can be re-used or recycled at the end of its useful life.
 Our manufacturing process has a very low carbon footprint, utilizing an assembly-oriented production strategy.  While we continue to enhance and adopt sustainable business practices, we recognize this is an ongoing effort with more to be accomplished, such as further reducing the direct and indirect aspects of our carbon footprint. 
 
Materials sourcing
 
Assuring the absence of conflict minerals in our power plants is a continuing initiative.  Our fuel cells, including the fuel cell components and completed fuel cell module, do not utilize any 3TG minerals (i.e., tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold) that are classified as conflict minerals.  We do utilize componentry in the BOP such as computer circuit boards that utilize trace amounts of 3TG minerals. For perspective, total shipments in fiscal year 2019 weighed approximately 1.8 million pounds, of which 8.0 pounds, or 0.000450%, represented 3TG minerals, so the presence of these minerals is minimal.  Our conflict mineral disclosure filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on Form SD contains specific information on the actions we are taking to avoid the use of conflict minerals.
 
38
 

Human Capital Resources
 
As of October 31, 2020, we had 316 full-time employees, of whom 121 were located at the Torrington, Connecticut manufacturing facility, 160 were located at the Danbury, Connecticut facility or other field offices within the U.S., and 35 were located abroad. We did not have any part-time employees. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.  We believe our relations with our employees are good.
Workforce Health and Safety
 We take workplace safety very seriously and are proud of the fact that we have never had a workplace fatality at any of our facilities or power plant installations. Our robust safety program, bolstered over the past five years, ensures that we are constantly evaluating our safety protocols in an effort to keep our facilities safe for our workers. 
 We work to continually improve what we believe is a robust safety program.  This is demonstrated by an improving safety trend over each of the past 5 years. Our Experience Modification Rates (“EMR”) for the past 5 years are as follows:2015: 1.0, 2016: 0.81, 2017: 0.65, 2018: 0.62, 2019: 0.65, and 2020: 0.59. We have maintained an “A” rating since 2016 providing “Safety Tier 1” performance with ISNetworld, a database for online contractor safety management designed to streamline companies' and contractors' compliance pre-qualification processes.
 
During fiscal year 2020, the Company launched a proactive response to the escalating COVID-19 outbreak and temporarily suspended operations at its Torrington, Connecticut manufacturing facility in March 2020. The Company also commenced remote work protocol for those employees worldwide that were capable of working from home. The Company took these actions to secure the safety of the Company’s employees, our corporate community as a whole, and the communities in which our team members live, and to adhere to Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommendations of social distancing and limited public exposure in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. All employees that were not able to work from home during the manufacturing facility shutdown due to their job function received full wages and benefits during such time. We did not implement any furlough, layoff or shared work program during such time. The Company resumed manufacturing in June 2020 and the Torrington, Connecticut manufacturing facility employees returned to work. The Company continues to encourage a remote work protocol for portions of the workforce due to the continuing pandemic. We continue to evaluate our ability to operate in light of recent resurgences of COVID-19 and the advisability of continuing operations based on federal, state and local guidance, evolving data concerning the pandemic and the best interests of our employees, customers and stockholders.
 Compensation and Benefits
 
As part of our compensation philosophy, we believe that we must offer and maintain market competitive compensation and benefit programs for our employees in order to attract and retain superior talent. In addition to competitive base wages, additional programs include an annual Management Incentive Plan, Long-Term Equity Incentive Plans, a Company matched 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, and employee assistance programs.
Diversity and Inclusion
 
We are committed to our continued efforts to increase diversity and foster an inclusive work environment that supports the global workforce and the communities we serve. We recruit the best qualified employees regardless of gender, ethnicity or other protected traits and it is our policy to fully comply with all laws (domestic and foreign) applicable to discrimination in the workplace. Our diversity, equity and inclusion principles are also reflected in our employee training and policies. We continue to enhance our diversity, equity and inclusion policies which are guided by our executive leadership team.
