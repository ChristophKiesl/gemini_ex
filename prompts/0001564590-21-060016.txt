 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
General
 Mesa Air Group, Inc. is the holding company of Mesa Airlines, Inc., a regional air carrier providing scheduled passenger service to 129 cities in 39 states, the District of Columbia, the Bahamas, and Mexico as well as cargo services out of Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. All of our flights are operated as either American Eagle, United Express, or DHL Express flights pursuant to the terms of capacity purchase agreements (“CPAs”) entered into with American Airlines, Inc. ("American") and United Airlines, Inc. ("United"), and pursuant to the terms of a Flight Services Agreement (“FSA”) with DHL Network Operations (USA), Inc. (“DHL”) (each, our "major partner"). We have a significant presence in several of our major partners' key domestic hubs and focus cities, including Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, and Washington-Dulles.
 As of September 30, 2021, we operated under the CPAs and FSA, or maintained as operational spares, a fleet of 153 aircraft with approximately 507 daily departures. We also lease 14 aircraft to a third party, for a total of 167 aircraft. We operate 40 CRJ-900 aircraft under our capacity purchase agreement with American (the "American CPA"), 20 E-175LL and 60 E-175 aircraft under our capacity purchase agreement with United (the "United CPA"), and two Boeing 737 aircraft under our flight services agreement with DHL (the “DHL FSA”). For our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, approximately 45% of our revenues were earned under the American CPA, approximately 52% were earned under the United CPA, approximately 2% were earned from leases of aircraft to a third party and approximately 1% were earned under the DHL FSA. All our operating revenue in our 2021 fiscal year was derived from operations associated with our American and United CPAs, DHL FSA, or from leases of aircraft to a third party. All our operating revenue in our 2020 and 2019 fiscal years was derived from operations associated with our American and United CPAs.
 Our agreements provide us guaranteed monthly revenue for each aircraft under contract, a fixed fee for each block hour (measured from takeoff to landing, including taxi time) and flight actually flown, and reimbursement of certain direct operating expenses in exchange for providing regional flying on behalf of our major partners. Our agreements also shelter us, to an extent, from many of the elements that cause volatility in airline financial performance, including fuel prices, variations in ticket prices, and fluctuations in number of passengers. In providing regional flying and cargo flight services under our agreements, we use the logos, service marks, flight crew uniforms and aircraft paint schemes of our major partners. Our major partners control route selection, pricing, seat inventories, marketing, and scheduling, and provide us with ground support services, airport landing slots and gate access. 
 Regional aircraft are optimal for short- and medium-haul scheduled flights that connect outlying communities with larger cities and act as "feeders" for domestic and international hubs. In addition, regional aircraft are well suited to serve larger city pairs during off-peak times when load factors on larger jets are low. The lower trip costs and operating efficiencies of regional aircraft, along with the competitive nature of the capacity purchase agreement bidding process, provide significant value to major airlines.
 COVID-19 Pandemic
 Beginning in fiscal 2020, COVID-19 surfaced in nearly all regions around the world and resulted in travel restrictions and business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected our revenue and operating results during fiscal 2020 and 2021. Any similar outbreaks in the future may have a material impact on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations in future periods. See “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for discussion regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial results. Also, see “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors” for discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our Business Strategy
 Our business strategy consists of the following elements:
 Maintain Low-Cost Structure
We have established ourselves as a low cost, efficient and reliable provider of regional airline and cargo flight services. We intend to continue our disciplined cost control approach through responsible outsourcing of certain operating functions, by flying large regional aircraft with associated lower maintenance costs and common flight crews across fleet types, and through the diligent control of corporate and administrative costs by implementing company-wide efforts to improve our cost structure. These efficiencies, coupled with the low average seniority of our pilots, has enabled us to compete aggressively on price in our capacity purchase and flight services agreement negotiations.
Attractive Work Opportunities
 We believe our employees have been, and will continue to be, a key to our success. Our ability to attract, recruit, and retain pilots has supported our industry-leading fleet growth. We intend to continue to offer competitive compensation packages, foster a positive and supportive work environment and provide opportunities to fly state-of-the-art, large-gauged regional jets to differentiate us from other carriers and make us an attractive place to work and build a career.
Maintain a Prudent and Conservative Capital Structure 
 We intend to continue to maintain a prudent capital structure, including with respect to the amount of debt we carry. We believe that our balance sheet and credit profile will enable us to optimize terms with lessors and vendors. 
Minimize Tail Risk
 
We have structured our aircraft leases and financing arrangements to minimize or eliminate, as much as possible, so-called "tail risk," which is the amount of aircraft-related lease obligations or projected negative equity existing beyond the term of that aircraft's corresponding capacity purchase or flight services agreement. We intend to continue to align the terms of our aircraft leases and financing agreements with the terms of our capacity purchase agreements and flight services agreement in order to maintain low "tail risk."
Aircraft Fleet
 We fly only large regional jets manufactured by Bombardier Aerospace (“Bombardier”) and Embraer S.A. ("Embraer"), as well as 737 cargo jets manufactured by Boeing. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (“MHI”), who acquired the CRJ business from Bombardier, and Embraer are the primary manufacturers of regional jets operated in the United States, which allows us to enjoy operational, recruiting and cost advantages over other regional airlines that operate smaller regional aircraft from less prominent manufacturers.

 The MHI (previously Bombardier) and Embraer regional jets are among the quietest commercial jets currently available and offer many of the amenities of larger commercial jet aircraft, including flight attendant service, a stand-up cabin, overhead and under seat storage, lavatories and in-flight snack and beverage service. The speed of MHI and Embraer regional jets is comparable to larger aircraft operated by major airlines, and they have a range of approximately 1,600 miles and 2,100 miles, respectively. We do not currently have any existing arrangements with MHI or Embraer to acquire additional aircraft.
 Capacity Purchase and Flight Services Agreements
 Our agreements consist of the following:
  
▪ | Operation of CRJ-900 aircraft under our American CPA;
--+------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Operation of E-175 aircraft under our United CPA;
--+--------------------------------------------------


▪ | Operation of Boeing 737 aircraft under our DHL FSA.
--+----------------------------------------------------

 The financial arrangements between the Company and its major partners include a revenue-guarantee arrangement. Under these revenue-guarantee provisions, our major partners pay us a fixed minimum monthly amount per aircraft under contract, plus additional amounts related to departures and block hours flown. We also receive direct reimbursement of certain operating expenses, including insurance. Other expenses, including fuel and ground operations are directly paid to suppliers by our major partners. We believe we are in material compliance with the terms of our capacity purchase agreements and flight services agreement, and enjoy good relationships with our major partners.
 6

We benefit from our capacity purchase agreements, flight services agreement, and revenue guarantees because we are sheltered, to an extent, from some of the elements that cause volatility in airline financial performance, including variations in ticket prices, fluctuations in number of passengers and fuel prices. However, we do not benefit from positive trends in ticket prices (including ancillary revenue programs), the number of passengers enplaned, or reductions in fuel prices. Our major partners retain all revenue collected from passengers carried on our flights. In providing regional flying under our capacity purchase agreements, and cargo flying under our flight services agreement, we use the logos, service marks and aircraft paint schemes of our major partners.
 The following table summarizes our available seat miles ("ASMs") flown and contract revenue recognized under our capacity purchase agreements for our fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively:

American Capacity Purchase Agreement
 As of September 30, 2021, we operated 40 CRJ-900 aircraft for American under our American CPA. In exchange for providing flight services under our American CPA, we receive a fixed monthly minimum amount per aircraft under contract plus certain additional amounts based upon the number of flights and block hours flown during each month. In addition, we may also receive incentives or incur penalties based upon our operational performance, including controllable on-time departures and controllable completion percentages. American also reimburses us for certain costs on an actual basis, including passenger liability and hull insurance and aircraft property taxes, all as set forth in our American CPA. Other expenses, including fuel and certain landing fees, are directly paid to suppliers by American. In addition, American also provides, at no cost to us, certain ground handling and customer service functions, as well as airport-related facilities and gates at American hubs and cities where we operate.
 
On November 19, 2020, we entered into an Amended and Restated American Capacity Purchase Agreement (the “Amended and Restated American CPA” or the “American CPA”) which was effective as of January 1, 2021 and amended and restated the Code Share and Revenue Sharing Agreement dated as of March 20, 2001 (as amended, supplemented, and modified, the “Existing CPA”), between Mesa Airlines and American. The Amended and Restated American CPA covers 40 CRJ-900 aircraft and provides for a new five-year term ending December 31, 2025. The Amended and Restated American CPA is subject to termination prior December 31, 2025, subject to our right to cure, in various circumstances including:
  
▪ | If either American or we become insolvent, file for bankruptcy, or fail to pay our debts as they become due, the non-defaulting party may terminate the agreement;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Failure by us or American to perform the covenants, conditions, or provisions of our American CPA, subject to certain notice and cure rights;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | If our FAA or DOT certification used in connection with our scheduled flights is for any reason suspended, revoked or materially impaired or otherwise not in full force and effect and we have not resumed operations, except as a result of an emergency airworthiness directive from the FAA affecting all similarly equipped aircraft, American may terminate the CPA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | If our controllable flight completion rate or our controllable on time departures fall below certain levels for a specified period of time, subject to our right to cure;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 7

 
▪ | Upon the occurrence of a force majeure event (as defined in the American CPA) that lasts for a specified period of consecutive days and affects our ability to operate scheduled flights, including a future epidemic or pandemic;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | If a labor dispute affects our ability to operate over a specified number of days or we operate in violation of any existing American collective bargaining agreement; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Upon a change in our ownership or control without the written approval of American.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the American CPA, American has the option in its sole discretion to withdraw up to: (i) 10 aircraft during calendar year 2021, (ii) five aircraft during each of calendar years 2022 and 2023, and (iii) during the period from January 1, 2024 to July 31, 2024, American can remove the first 20 aircraft to the extent not otherwise removed in 2021 – 2023, and thereafter American has the right to remove the last 20 aircraft. American also has the right and option to withdraw one aircraft upon each occurrence of the following: (i) if our controllable flight completion factor falls below certain levels for a specified period of time, (ii) if our controllable on time departures fall below certain levels for a specified period of time, and (iii) if we fail to meet certain cabin interior and refurbishment requirements as defined in the American CPA.
 
During fiscal year 2021, we entered into amendments to the American CPA. The amendments reflect the following:
  
▪ | The addition of CRJ-900 aircraft to the American CPA (collectively, the “Incremental Aircraft”) in accordance with the following schedule: (i) 3 aircraft, from January 5, 2021 to March 3, 2021, (ii) increasing to a total of 5 aircraft, from March 4, 2021 to May 5, 2021, (iii) decreasing to a total of 3 aircraft, from May 6, 2021 to June 2, 2021, and (iv) increasing to a total of 5 aircraft, from June 3, 2021 to August 17, 2021.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | A temporary reduction in certain rates for the period December 2020 through September 2021.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | The waiver of the operational performance metrics for the month of August 2021, and extension of the deadline for completing certain cabin interior and refurbishment requirements as defined in the American CPA to December 31, 2021.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Increases to incentive and penalty compensation under the American CPA, effective beginning in October 2021.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

United Capacity Purchase Agreement
 As of September 30, 2021, we operated 20 E-175LL and 60 E-175 aircraft for United under our United CPA. In exchange for providing flight services under our United CPA, we receive a fixed monthly minimum amount per aircraft under contract plus certain additional amounts based upon the number of flights and block hours flown and the results of passenger satisfaction surveys. United also reimburses us for certain costs on an actual basis, including property tax per aircraft and passenger liability insurance. Other expenses, including fuel and certain landing fees, are directly paid to suppliers by United. 
 Under our United CPA, United owns 42 of the 60 E-175 aircraft and all of the E-175LL aircraft and leases them to us at nominal amounts. United reimburses us on a pass-through basis for all costs related to heavy airframe and engine maintenance, landing gear, auxiliary power units ("APUs") and component maintenance for the aircraft owned by United. Our United CPA permits United, subject to certain conditions, including the payment of certain costs tied to aircraft type, to terminate the agreement in its discretion, or remove aircraft from service, by giving us notice of 90 days or more. If United elects to terminate our United CPA in its entirety or permanently remove select aircraft from service, we are permitted to return any of the affected aircraft leased from United at no cost to us. In addition, if United removes any of our 18 owned E-175 aircraft from service at its direction, United would remain obligated, at our option, to assume the aircraft ownership and associated debt with respect to such aircraft through the end of the term of the agreement.
 On November 26, 2019, we amended and restated our United CPA to, among other things, incorporate the terms of the 14 prior amendments to that Agreement and to extend the term thereof through the addition of twenty (20) new Embraer E-175LL aircraft to the scope of such Agreement. Under this 
 8

amendment and restatement, these new aircraft were to be financed and owned by us and operated for a period of twelve (12) years from the in-service date. Deliveries of the new E-175LL aircraft were scheduled to begin in May 2020. In March 2020, the deliveries of the new E-175LL aircraft were negotiated between United and Embraer to begin in September 2020 and be completed by the quarter ended June 30, 2021.  Commencing five (5) years after the actual in-service date, United has the right to remove the E-175LL aircraft from service by giving us notice of 90 days or more, subject to certain conditions, including the payment of certain wind-down expenses plus, if removed prior to the ten (10) year anniversary of the in-service date, certain accelerated margin payments.   
 In addition to adding the 20 new E-175LL aircraft to the amended and restated United CPA, we extended the term of our 42 E-175 aircraft leased from United for an additional five (5) years, which now expire between 2024 and 2028. In addition to the aircraft we lease from United at nominal amounts, we own 18 E-175 aircraft that are operated for United which expire in 2028. As part of the amended and restated United CPA, we agreed to lease our CRJ-700 aircraft (previously operated under our United CPA) to another United Express service provider for a term of nine (9) years and continued to operate such aircraft until they were transitioned to the new service provider. United has a right to purchase the CRJ-700 aircraft at the then fair market value. 
 On November 4, 2020, we amended and restated our United CPA to, among other things, amend the ownership by United, in lieu of Mesa Airlines, of the 20 new E175LL aircraft. Under this new amendment, these aircraft are financed by United and leased to the Company to operate for a period of twelve (12) years from the aircraft acceptance and in-service date. We agreed to adjusted rates to account for the change in ownership of the E175LL aircraft, granted United relief from certain provisions related to minimum utilization until December 31, 2021 and the additional right to remove one or more E-175LL aircraft in the event that we fail to meet certain financial covenants. We also agreed to a one-time provision for United to prepay $81.5 million under the United CPA for our future performance (the “Prepayment”) and the application of certain discounts to certain payment obligations of United under the United CPA. Weekly payments under the United CPA were discounted following the Prepayment, with $65.1 million of the Prepayment earned during our first and second quarters of fiscal 2021 and the remaining $16.4 million repaid to United during the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The terms of the Prepayment also included affirmative and negative covenants and events of default customary for transactions of this type. Proceeds from the Prepayment were used to retire debt on certain airframes and engines that now serve as collateral under the term loan facility provided to Mesa Airlines by the U.S. Department of the Treasury.
 In September 2021, we amended our United CPA to, among other things, adjust certain rates to account for the change in ownership of the E-175LL aircraft, and provide for temporary reduced rates during periods in which the Company receives government assistance.
 Our United CPA is subject to early termination under various circumstances noted above and including:
  
▪ | By United if certain operational performance factors fall below a specified percentage for a specified time, subject to notice under certain circumstances;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | By United if we fail to perform the material covenants, agreements, terms or conditions of our United CPA or similar agreements with United, subject to thirty (30) days' notice and cure rights;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | If either United or we become insolvent, file bankruptcy, or fail to pay debts when due, the non-defaulting party may terminate the agreement; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | By United if we merge with, or if control of us is acquired by another air carrier or a corporation directly or indirectly owning or controlling another air carrier.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DHL Flight Services Agreement
 On December 20, 2019, we entered into our DHL FSA. Under the terms of this agreement, we operate two (2) Boeing 737-400F aircraft to provide cargo air transportation services to DHL. In exchange for providing such services, we receive a fee per block hour with a minimum block hour guarantee. We are 
 9

also eligible for a monthly performance bonus or subject to a monthly penalty based on timeliness and completion performance. Ground support including fueling and airport fees are paid directly by DHL.
 Under our DHL FSA, DHL leases two Boeing 737-400F aircraft and subleases them to us at nominal amounts. DHL reimburses us on a pass-through basis for all costs related to heavy maintenance including C-checks, off-wing engine maintenance and overhauls including Life Limited Parts (LLPs), landing gear overhauls and LLPs, thrust reverser overhauls, and APU overhauls and LLPs.  Certain items such as fuel, de-icing fluids, landing fees, aircraft ground handling fees, en-route navigation fees and custom fees are paid directly to suppliers by DHL or otherwise reimbursed if incurred by us.
 The DHL FSA expires five (5) years from the commencement date of the first aircraft placed into service, which was in October 2020. DHL has the option to extend the agreement with respect to one or more aircraft for a period of one year with 90 days’ advance written notice.
 Our DHL FSA is subject to the following termination rights prior to its expiration:
  
▪ | At any time after the first anniversary of the commencement date of the first aircraft placed in service with 90 day’s written notice.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Failure to comply with performance standards for three consecutive measurement periods.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | DHL may terminate the agreement for a specific aircraft if it is subject to a total loss and we do not provide alternate services at our expense.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maintenance and Repairs
 Airlines are subject to extensive regulation. We have a FAA mandated and approved maintenance program. Aircraft maintenance and repair consists of routine and non-routine maintenance, and work performed is divided into three general categories: line maintenance, heavy maintenance, and component service. We also outsource certain aircraft maintenance and other operating functions. We use competitive bidding among qualified vendors to procure these services. We have long-term maintenance contracts with AAR to provide fixed-rate parts procurement and component overhaul services for our aircraft fleet. Under these agreements, AAR provides maintenance and engineering services on any aircraft that we designate during the term of the agreement, along with access to a spare parts inventory pool, in exchange for a fixed monthly fee. 
 Line maintenance consists of routine daily and weekly scheduled maintenance checks on our aircraft. Line maintenance is performed at certain locations throughout our system and represents the majority of and most extensive maintenance we perform. Major airframe maintenance checks consist of a series of more complex tasks that can take from one to four weeks to accomplish and typically are required approximately every 28 months, on average, across our fleet. Engine overhauls and engine performance restoration events are quite extensive and can take two months. We maintain an inventory of spare engines to provide for continued operations during engine maintenance events. We expect to begin the initial planned engine maintenance overhauls on our new engine fleet approximately four to six years after the date of manufacture and introduction into our fleet, with subsequent engine maintenance every four to six years thereafter. Due to our current fleet size, we believe outsourcing all of our heavy maintenance, engine restoration, and major part repair is more economical than performing this work using our internal maintenance team.
 Competition
 We consider our primary competition to be U.S. regional airlines that currently hold or compete for capacity purchase agreements for passenger services with major airlines. Our competition includes, therefore, nearly every other domestic regional airline, including Air Wisconsin Airlines Corporation; Endeavor Air, Inc. (owned by Delta) ("Endeavor"); Envoy Air, Inc. ("Envoy"), PSA Airlines, Inc. ("PSA") and Piedmont Airlines, Inc. ("Piedmont") (Envoy, PSA and Piedmont are owned by American); Horizon Air 
 10

Industries, Inc. (owned by Alaska Air Group, Inc.) ("Horizon"); SkyWest Inc., parent of SkyWest Airlines, Inc.; Republic Airways Holdings Inc.; and Trans States Airlines, Inc.
Major airlines typically offer capacity purchase arrangements to regional airlines on the basis of the following criteria: availability of labor resources; proposed contract economic terms; reliable and on-time flight operations; corporate financial resources including ability to procure and finance aircraft; customer service levels; and other factors.
 Certain of our competitors are larger and have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do. Moreover, economic downturns, combined with competitive pressures, have contributed to a number of reorganizations, bankruptcies, liquidations, and business combinations among major and regional carriers. The effect of economic downturns is somewhat mitigated by our reliance on capacity purchase agreements with revenue-guarantee provisions, but the renewal and continued profitability of these partnerships with our major partners is not guaranteed.
 Seasonality
 Our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year since the airline industry is subject to seasonal fluctuations and general economic conditions. Our operations are somewhat favorably affected by increased utilization of our aircraft in the summer months and are unfavorably affected by increased fleet maintenance and by inclement weather during the winter months.
Aircraft Fuel
 Our capacity purchase and flight services agreements provide that our major partners source, procure, and directly pay third-party vendors for all fuel used in the performance of those agreements. Accordingly, we do not recognize fuel expenses or revenues for flying under our capacity purchase and flight services agreements and we face very limited exposure to fuel price fluctuations.
Insurance
 We maintain insurance policies that we believe are of types customary in the airline industry and as required by the DOT, lessors and other financing parties, and our major partners under the terms of our capacity purchase and flight services agreements. The policies principally provide liability coverage for public and passenger injury; damage to property; loss of or damage to flight equipment; fire; auto; directors' and officers' liability; advertiser and media liability; cyber risk liability; fiduciary; workers' compensation and employer's liability; and war risk (terrorism). Although we currently believe our insurance coverage is adequate, we cannot assure you that the amount of such coverage will not be changed or that we will not be forced to bear substantial losses from accidents.
Human Capital Management
 As of September 30, 2021, we employed approximately 3,241 employees, consisting of 1,258 pilots or pilot recruits, 1,143 flight attendants, 42 flight dispatchers, 531 maintenance employees and 267 employees in administrative or other roles. Our continued success is partly dependent on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel. We have never been the subject of a labor strike or labor action that materially impacted our operations.
 FAA regulations require pilots to have an Airline Transport Pilot ("ATP") license with specific ratings for the aircraft to be flown, and to be medically certified as physically fit to fly. FAA and medical certifications are subject to periodic renewal requirements including recurrent training and recent flying experience. Mechanics, quality-control inspectors, and flight dispatchers must be certificated and qualified for specific aircraft. Flight attendants must have initial and periodic competency training and qualification. Training 
 11

programs are subject to approval and monitoring by the FAA. Management personnel directly involved in the supervision of flight operations, training, maintenance, and aircraft inspection must also meet experience standards prescribed by FAA regulations. All safety-sensitive employees are subject to pre-employment, random, and post-accident drug testing.
 The airline industry has from time to time experienced a shortage of qualified personnel, particularly with respect to pilots and maintenance technicians. In addition, as is common with most of our competitors, we have faced considerable turnover of our employees. Regional airline pilots, flight attendants, and maintenance technicians often leave to work for larger airlines, which generally offer higher salaries and better benefit programs than regional airlines are financially able to offer. Should the turnover of employees, particularly pilots and maintenance technicians, sharply increase, the result will be significantly higher training costs than otherwise would be necessary, as well as a shortage in the required number of applicable personnel, and we may need to request a reduced flight schedule with our major partners, which may result in operational performance penalties under our capacity purchase agreements or flight services agreement. We cannot assure that we will be able to recruit, train and retain the qualified employees that we need to carry out our expansion plans or replace departing employees. 
 As of September 30, 2021, approximately 74.1% of our employees were represented by labor unions under collective-bargaining agreements, as set forth below. No other employees of ours or our subsidiaries are parties to any other collective bargaining agreement or union contracts.
 
 
Employee Groups | Number of Employees | | Representative | | Labor Agreement Amendable As of
-----------------------+---------------------+-------+----------------+----------------------------------+--------------------------------
Pilots | | 1,258 | | Air Line Pilots Association | | 7/13/2021
Flight Attendants | | 1,143 | | Association of Flight Attendants | | 10/1/2021
Dispatchers | | 42 | | N/A | | 
Maintenance Department | | 531 | | N/A | | 
Administrative | | 267 | | N/A | | 

 
The Railway Labor Act ("RLA") governs our relations with labor organizations. Under the RLA, the collective bargaining agreements generally do not expire, but instead become amendable as of a stated date. If either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement, they must notify the other party in the manner agreed to by the parties. Under the RLA, after receipt of such notice, the parties must meet for direct negotiations, and if no agreement is reached, either party may request the National Mediation Board ("NMB") to appoint a federal mediator. The RLA prescribes no set timetable for the direct negotiation and mediation process. It is not unusual for those processes to last for many months, and even for a few years. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB in its discretion may declare at some time that an impasse exists, and if an impasse is declared, the NMB proffers binding arbitration to the parties. Either party may decline to submit to arbitration. If arbitration is rejected by either party, a 30-day "cooling off" period commences. During that period (or after), a Presidential Emergency Board ("PEB") may be established, which examines the parties' positions and recommends a solution. The PEB process lasts for 30 days and is followed by another "cooling off" period of 30 days. At the end of a "cooling off" period, unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by Congress, the labor organization may strike and the airline may resort to "self-help," including the imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments and the hiring of new employees to replace any striking workers. Congress and the President have the authority to prevent "self-help" by enacting legislation that, among other things, imposes a settlement on the parties. The table above sets forth our employee groups and status of the collective bargaining agreements.
