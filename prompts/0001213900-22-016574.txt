ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General



We are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company on September 15, 2020. We were incorporated for the purpose of acquiring, engaging in a share exchange, share reconstruction and amalgamation, contractual control arrangement with, purchasing all or substantially all of the assets of, or engaging in any other similar initial business combination with one or more businesses or entities which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as our initial business combination.



Our sponsor is Kismet Sponsor Limited, a British Virgin Islands company. The registration statement for our initial public offering was declared effective on February 17, 2021. On February 22, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 23,000,000 units, including 3,000,000 additional units to cover the underwriters’ over-allotment option, at $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $230.0 million, and incurring offering costs of approximately $13.1 million, of which approximately $8.1 million was for deferred underwriting commissions.



Simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering, we consummated the private placement of 4,400,000 warrants, at a price of $1.50 per private placement warrant with our sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $6.6 million, and incurring offering costs of approximately $7,000.



Upon the closing of the initial public offering and the private placement, $230.0 million ($10.00 per unit) of the net proceeds of the initial public offering and a portion of the proceeds of the private placement were placed in a trust account, with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and invested in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, as determined by us, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a business combination and (ii) the distribution of the trust account as described elsewhere in this Annual Report.



Our units began trading on February 18, 2021 on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “KAIIU.” Commencing on April 12, 2021, the Class A ordinary shares and warrants comprising the units began separate trading on Nasdaq under the symbols “KAII” and “KAIIW”, respectively. Those units not separated continue to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol “KAIIU.”



Business Strategy



We seek to capitalize on the substantial deal sourcing, investing and operating expertise of our founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ivan Tavrin. Mr. Tavrin is an entrepreneur and a founder of Kismet Capital Group, an international multi-strategy investment firm, which owns and operates companies in telecommunications and media sectors, invests directly in private high growth companies, as well as investment funds, including into some of the world leading managers as a limited partner. Kismet Capital Group owns Media-1, a large independent media broadcasting groups which operates free-to-air (FTA) TV channels, including U Channel, Muz-Tv and Disney Channel Russia, owned pursuant to a joint venture with The Walt Disney Company, or Disney (NYSE: DIS). Mr. Tavrin is an indirect controlling shareholder in a leading regional radio network “Vyberi Radio”, in a large digital out-of-home advertising operator “Gallery” and in a large independent tower infrastructure operator New Towers



While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any industry or sector and in any region, we have initially focused on industries that complement our management team’s background and network so we can capitalize on their ability to identify, acquire and operate a business. We, therefore, have focused on companies in the internet and technology sectors. Due to the current unstable situation, we do not intend to search for a business combination in Russia or Belarus, and instead intend to focus on the wider area of EMEA, especially the Middle East and Africa. We may, however, decide to enter into an initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines.



We believe our sponsor’s and management team’s deal sourcing, investing and operating expertise, as well as their network of contacts uniquely position us to take advantage of proprietary opportunities in the internet and technology sectors, where we believe opportunities exist to acquire high growth companies that are scaling at an unprecedented pace by introducing new business models and disrupting traditional industries. Moreover, we believe there are opportunities to consolidate assets across fragmented sub-sectors, creating new majors with improved efficiencies and network effects through scale. We believe this expertise and network of contacts allows us to generate a number of acquisition opportunities.

Venture capital investment in technology companies in Europe has tripled in the last five years and the number of unicorns in Europe has increased 19 times over from 2015 through 2021. We believe there are a number of high-quality internet and technology companies within that universe of the private companies with adequate scale to be attractive public companies in the United States.



Additionally, during the past several years numerous technology companies have been established by software development teams focusing on fintech, online gaming, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and machine learning, distributed computing and data analytics. These companies often achieved significant scale in Europe or North America and we believe would be attractive as public companies listed on Nasdaq.



We have, and intend to continue to, seek out potential targets that we believe have proven business models and attractive growth profiles. We also believe our sponsor’s and management team’s extensive experience in deal sourcing from private and public sources, as well as their advisory and consulting engagements, provide unique insight when identifying potential business combination opportunities and creating value. We believe their experience and proximity to real-time information positions us to obtain access to differentiated deal flow, frequently in a non-competitive manner and prior to other parties with an interest in such transactions.



Under conditions where the capital markets in EMEA are generally less developed than the U.S. capital markets, we believe we can provide the target company with an attractive alternative path to a public listing or sale.



In September 2020, Mr. Tavrin founded Kismet Three, a blank check company incorporated for substantially similar purposes as our company. Kismet Three completed its initial public offering in February 2021, in which it sold 28.75 million units, each unit consisting of one Class A ordinary share of Kismet Three and one-third of one redeemable warrant to purchase one Class A ordinary share of Kismet Three, for an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating aggregate gross proceeds of $287.5 million. Kismet Three has not yet announced or completed its initial business combination. Mr. Tavrin, who serves as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, also serves as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kismet Three. In addition, Clifford Tompsett, one of our directors, also serves as a director of Kismet Three.



Acquisition Criteria



Consistent with this strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We intend to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet any of these criteria and guidelines.



We intend to seek to acquire companies that we believe:




● | have strong competitive positions, proven business models and attractive growth prospects;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | have limited access to capital markets due to external factors;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | could benefit from the substantial expertise, experience and network of our sponsor and management team, who could assist with, for example, growth strategy, international expansion, operations and the evaluation and integration of acquisitions;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | are well positioned to participate in sector consolidation and would benefit from a public acquisition currency; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | offer attractive risk-adjusted returns.
--+----------------------------------------




These criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant.

Initial Business Combination



Nasdaq rules require that our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable, if any, on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA, or from an independent accounting firm, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.



We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. Nasdaq rules require that our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable, if any, on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as our initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking shareholder approval, as applicable. If our securities are not listed on Nasdaq after our initial public offering, we would not be required to satisfy the 80% requirement. However, we intend to satisfy the 80% requirement even if our securities are not listed on Nasdaq at the time of our initial business combination.



Our Acquisition Process



In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review that will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us. We also expect to utilize our operational and capital planning experience.



Given our experience, we will have the capacity to appropriately source opportunities and conduct a substantial portion of due diligence ourselves, relying less on third parties than many other similar companies.



We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or from an independent accounting firm, that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors.

Post-Acquisition Leadership



After the initial business combination, we will seek to apply a rigorous approach to enhancing shareholder value through our participation on the board of directors or through direct involvement with company operations or both. We intend to rely on the extensive professional network of our founder including, long term associates and former employees and will assemble a team of industry experts that have the most relevant expertise to enhance the shareholder value.



Our Management Team



For a description of our management team, See Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance of this Annual Report.



Competition



In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash to our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Employees



We currently have one executive officer. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any member of our management team will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
