Key trends affecting our business include electrification, connectivity and autonomy. In addition, our business is affected by the consolidation of automotive manufacturers, as well as new non-traditional entrants to the automotive industry, the collaboration of automotive manufacturers on commonized vehicle platforms, increasing demand for luxury and performance features, including increasing levels of electrical and electronic content, and China’s emergence as the largest automotive market in the world. In particular, we believe that we have a significant opportunity for growth in China with both global and domestic automotive manufacturers.
Another key trend benefiting our business is the shift toward crossover and sport utility vehicles. Our content on such vehicles, especially those for which our Seating segment supplies products, can be significantly higher than our average content per vehicle. Crossover and sport utility vehicle production has grown to approximately 40% of total vehicle production in 2020, up from 27% of total vehicle production five years ago. China has been a major driver of this trend, where crossover and sport utility vehicle production now comprises approximately 43% of total vehicle production, up from 28% of total vehicle production five years ago.
Our strategy addresses these trends and the major imperatives for success as an automotive supplier: quality, service, cost and efficiency, and innovation and technology. We have expanded key component and software capabilities through organic investment and acquisitions to ensure a full complement of the best solutions for our customers. We have restructured, and continue to align, our manufacturing and engineering footprint to attain a leading competitive cost position globally. We have established or expanded activities in new and growing markets, especially China, in support of our customers’ growth initiatives and in pursuit of opportunities with new customers. These initiatives have helped us achieve our financial goals overall, as well as a more balanced regional, customer and vehicle segment diversification in our business.
In addition, we believe that demand for energy efficiency and reduced carbon emissions, as well as the demand for enhanced communications and safety, are driving the technology trends of electrification, connectivity and autonomy. We are focused on those trends which provide us with significant business opportunities where we have competitive differentiation and innovative technology. While both of our businesses are powertrain agnostic, we are well positioned to capitalize on the following technology trends, each of which is likely to be at the forefront of our industry for the foreseeable future in light of the long-term convergence toward electric, connected and autonomous vehicles:
•Electrification – Demand for more energy efficient vehicles is increasing, both from automotive manufacturers to meet stricter fuel economy and emissions standards and from a growing segment of end consumers who wish to reduce the carbon impact of automobiles. This requires further use of electronically controlled and assisted powertrains and related components to improve fuel efficiency, the adoption of alternative energy powertrains, such as 48-volt mild hybrid, full hybrid, plug-in hybrid and pure battery electric, that facilitate electrification of the vehicle, and the use of lighter weight materials throughout the vehicle.
•Connectivity – Customer and consumer demands for continuous communication and information exchange with the vehicle are increasing. What began with consumer demand to extend and integrate mobile connectivity into the vehicle by connecting mobile devices with vehicle infotainment systems is evolving such that the vehicle has an embedded, direct line of wireless communication connecting it with various networks (e.g., cellular, infrastructure, satellite, etc.) and other vehicles. We expect these trends to continue, making the vehicle a constantly connected device, receiving and transmitting data through a variety of signals which communicate directly with on-board vehicle systems, and facilitating delivery of content and services for consumers and automotive manufacturers.
•Autonomy/Advanced Driver Assistance – Customer and consumer demands are evolving from safety features and systems that protect vehicle occupants when a crash occurs to advanced driver assistance systems that help prevent crashes by assisting in the vehicle’s operation under certain conditions. The development of automated intervention uses many of the same core technologies that will enable vehicles to drive autonomously under an increasing variety of driving conditions.
•Shared Mobility – As vehicle utilization increases and ride-sharing becomes more relevant, customer and consumer demands for more services, enhanced personalization and an improved mobility experience are also increasing.
Regulation is also a major influence on these trends, as government mandates (e.g., for vehicles to meet minimum fuel economy and emissions standards or be equipped with certain safety-related components) are driving vehicle design and technology plans.
We are well positioned with respect to these trends as we design and manufacture products across our entire E-Systems portfolio that are aligned with the trends toward electrification, connectivity, autonomy and shared mobility. Our product lines offer growth opportunities that are aligned with these trends but are ultimately dependent on global vehicle production volumes.
Furthermore, our seats are an active part of the occupant experience and the vehicle safety system. As a result of our innovative product design and technology capabilities, we are able to provide seats with enhanced safety features, such as the active head restraint and seat mechanisms that withstand collision impact in excess of what is demanded by regulatory agencies. We have developed products and materials to reduce cost and enhance seat design and packaging flexibility, including our mini recliners and micro adjust tracks. Additionally, we have focused our innovation efforts on the configurability of seat positioning, which provides consumers with advanced seating features and functionality and has resulted in the development of our ConfigurE+TM configurable seat system. Another way in which we are well positioned to benefit from this trend-related growth is our belief that the seat system will become increasingly more sophisticated, dynamic and connected to both the occupants and the vehicle. The seat is the logical focal point for monitoring the driver and passengers and for facilitating feedback between the vehicle and the occupants.
We believe that the convergence of these technology trends and eventual proliferation of autonomous vehicles will benefit both our Seating and E-Systems segments. We believe that autonomous vehicles will have seat designs and requirements that are far more flexible and demanding in both autonomous and piloted driving states. Further, more active monitoring of the driver and the driver’s position and physical state will be required to manage the transitions between autonomous and piloted driving conditions. A demand for mobility services and on-demand transportation from providers such as Uber, Lyft and Didi (in China) 
is helping to drive interest and growth in these technology trends, particularly fully autonomous vehicles. The increasing prevalence of mobility services will potentially create a new segment of autonomous vehicle fleet customers with unique vehicle technology and design needs, including more flexible, durable and connected seating solutions for a wide range of passengers. Not only will autonomous vehicles need to be fully connected and networked to maximize their safety and efficiency, their power consumption will be significantly higher to support the array of sensors and processing power required to operate such vehicles. This will allow us to take further advantage of our ability to design and offer efficient power management solutions. INTUTM Seating and ConfigurE+TM in our Seating segment and our capabilities in connectivity, including gateway modules, and the features and functions facilitated by Xevo market in our E-Systems segment are well-aligned with the trend toward autonomous vehicles.

For additional factors that may impact our E-Systems segment’s business, financial condition, operating results and/or cash flows, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors."
Customers
In 2020, General Motors and Ford, two of the largest automotive and light truck manufacturers in the world, accounted for 19% and 13% of our net sales, respectively. In addition, Stellantis (reflective of the 2021 merger of PSA and Fiat Chrysler) accounted for 11% of our 2020 net sales. We supply and have expertise in all vehicle segments of the automotive market. Our sales content tends to be higher on those vehicle platforms and segments which offer more features and functionality. The popularity of particular vehicle platforms and segments varies over time and by regional market. We expect to continue to win new business and grow sales at a greater rate than overall automotive industry production. For further information related to our customers and domestic and foreign sales and operations, see Note 15, "Segment Reporting," to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
Our customers award business to their suppliers in a number of ways, including the award of complete systems, which allows suppliers either to manufacture components internally or to purchase components from other suppliers at their discretion. Certain of our customers also elect to award certain components directly to component suppliers and independent of the award of the complete system. We have been selectively expanding our component capabilities and investing in manufacturing capacity in low-cost regions in order to enhance our cost competitive structure and maximize our participation in such direct component sourcing by our customers.
Our customers typically award contracts several years before actual production is scheduled to begin. Each year, the automotive manufacturers introduce new models, update existing models and discontinue certain models and, periodically, even complete brands. In this process, we may be selected as the supplier on a new model, we may continue as the supplier on an updated model or we may lose the business on a new or updated model to a competitor. Our sales backlog reflects our estimated net sales over the next three years from formally awarded new programs, less lost and discontinued programs. This measure excludes the sales backlog at our non-consolidated joint ventures. As of January 2021, our 2021 to 2023 sales backlog is $2.8 billion, an increase of 4% as compared to our sales backlog as of January 2020. Our current sales backlog reflects $1.0 billion related to 2021 and 68% and 32% related to our Seating and E-Systems segments, respectively. In addition, our 2021 to 2023 sales backlog at our non-consolidated joint ventures is approximately $400 million. Our current sales backlog assumes volumes based on the independent industry projections of IHS Markit as of December 2020 and internal estimates, a Euro exchange rate of $1.18/Euro and a Chinese RMB exchange rate of 6.65/$. This sales backlog is generally subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including vehicle production volumes on new and replacement programs and foreign exchange rates, as well as the timing of production launches and changes in customer development plans. For additional information regarding risks that may affect our sales backlog, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors," and Part II — Item 7, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Forward-Looking Statements."
We receive purchase orders from our customers that generally provide for the supply of a customer’s annual requirements for a particular vehicle model and assembly plant, or in some cases, for the supply of a customer’s requirements for the life of a particular vehicle model, rather than for the purchase of a specified quantity of products. Although most purchase orders may be terminated by our customers at any time, such terminations have been infrequent and have not had a material impact on our 
operating results. We are subject to risks that an automotive manufacturer will produce fewer units of a vehicle model than anticipated or that an automotive manufacturer will not award us a replacement program following the life of a vehicle model. To reduce our reliance on any one vehicle model, we produce automotive systems and components for a broad cross-section of both new and established models. However, larger cars and light trucks, as well as vehicle platforms that offer more features and functionality, such as luxury, sport utility and crossover vehicles, typically have more content and, therefore, tend to have a more significant impact on our operating performance. Our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020, consisted of 31% passenger cars, 52% crossover and sport utility vehicles and 17% trucks and vans.
Our agreements with our major customers generally provide for an annual productivity price reduction. Historically, cost reductions through product design changes, increased manufacturing productivity and similar programs with our suppliers have generally offset these customer-imposed price reduction requirements. However, raw material, energy and commodity costs can be volatile. Although we have developed and implemented strategies to mitigate the impact of higher raw material, energy and commodity costs, these strategies, together with commercial negotiations with our customers and suppliers, typically offset only a portion of the adverse impact. Certain of these strategies also may limit our opportunities in a declining commodity environment. In addition, we are exposed to increasing market risk associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange as a result of our low-cost footprint and vertical integration strategies. We use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. For additional information regarding our foreign exchange and commodity price risk, see Part II — Item 7, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Financial Condition — Foreign Exchange" and "— Commodity Prices."
Seasonality
Our principal operations are directly related to the automotive industry. Consequently, we may experience seasonal fluctuations to the extent automotive vehicle production slows, such as in the summer months when many customer plants close for model year changeovers, in December when many customer plants close for the holidays and during periods of high vehicle inventory. See Note 17, "Quarterly Financial Data," to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
Raw Materials
The principal raw materials used in our seat systems, electrical distribution and connection systems and electronic systems are generally available and obtained from multiple suppliers under various types of supply agreements. Components such as fabric, foam, leather, seat mechanisms, terminals and connectors, and certain other components are either manufactured by us internally or purchased from multiple suppliers under various types of supply agreements. The majority of the steel used in our products is comprised of fabricated components that are integrated into a seat system, such as seat frames, recliner mechanisms, seat tracks and other mechanical components. Therefore, our exposure to changes in steel prices is primarily indirect, through these purchased components. With the exception of certain terminals and connectors, the materials that we use to manufacture wire harness assemblies are substantially purchased from suppliers, including extruded and insulated wire and cable. The majority of our copper purchases are comprised of extruded wire and cable that we integrate into electrical wire harnesses. In general, our copper purchases, as well as a significant portion of our leather purchases, are subject to price index agreements with our customers and suppliers. We utilize a combination of short-term and long-term supply contracts to purchase key components. We generally retain the right to terminate these agreements if our supplier does not remain competitive in terms of cost, quality, delivery, technology or customer support.
