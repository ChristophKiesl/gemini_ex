 OVERVIEW
McAfee has been a pioneer and leader in protecting consumers from cyberattacks with integrated security, privacy, identity and trust solutions. For over 30 years, consumers have turned to McAfee as a leader in cybersecurity services. We built our platform through a deep, rich history of innovation and have established a leading global brand. When securing the digital experience of a consumer who is increasingly living life online, McAfee is singularly committed to one mission: to protect our subscribers' digital presence through leading-edge cybersecurity.

We live in a digital world. Consumers are increasingly mobile, interacting through multiple devices, networks and platforms, while leveraging technology as they work, socialize, consume and transact. Remote and increasing work and study from home arrangements are driving a pronounced convergence of professional and personal life. This lifestyle shift has been accompanied by a more advanced cyberthreat landscape and a proliferation of points of vulnerability, risking individuals’ privacy, identity, personal data, sensitive information and other vital resources. This challenge has heightened the importance of securing the consumers’ converged digital life.
We have a differentiated ability to secure the consumers’ digital experience against cyberthreats, using our proprietary advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities combined with our real-time threat intelligence that leverages the scale and diversity of our threat sensor network. Our network of over 600 million customer devices generates massive amounts of telemetry that we translate into actionable, real-time insights. As of 2020, our vast and dynamic data set and advanced analytics capabilities enabled us to provide defense for advanced zero-day threats by training machine learning models on the over 60 billion threat queries. McAfee simplifies the complexity of threat detection and response by correlating events, detecting new threats, reducing false positives, and guiding consumers through remediation. Protecting our subscribers has been the foundation of our success, enabling us to maintain an industry-leading reputation among our subscribers and partners.
Our Personal Protection Service provides holistic digital protection for an individual or family at home, on the go, and on the web. Our platform includes device security, privacy and safe Wi-Fi, online protection, and identity protection, creating a seamless and integrated digital moat. With a single interface, simple set up and ease of use, consumers obtain immediate time-to-value whether on a computer, smartphone or tablet, and across multiple operating systems.
Our broad and digitally-led omni-channel go-to-market strategy reaches the consumer at crucial moments in their cybersecurity purchase lifecycle resulting in the protection of over 600 million devices.

We also increasingly have partnerships as the consumer security provider to mobile and internet service providers (“ISPs”) as the demand for mobile security protection increases. Through many of these relationships, our consumer security software is pre-installed on devices on a trial basis until conversion to a paid subscription. Our go-to-market channel also includes some of the largest retailers globally. We operate a global business, with 39% of our fiscal 2021 net revenue earned outside of the United States.
SALE OF OUR ENTERPRISE BUSINESS
 On July 27, 2021, we completed the sale of our Enterprise Business to STG, pursuant to a Contribution and Equity Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) entered in on March 6, 2021 between McAfee, LLC (“US Seller”) and McAfee Security UK LTD (“UK Seller” and together with US Seller, the “Seller Entities”) and Magenta Buyer LLC, organized by a consortium led by STG, in exchange for (i) $4,000,000,000 in cash consideration and (ii) the assumption of certain liabilities of the Enterprise Business as specified in the Purchase Agreement. We believe this transaction allows McAfee to singularly focus on our Consumer business and to accelerate our strategy to be a leader in personal security for consumers.
In connection with the closing of the sale, the Seller Entities and Buyer entered into a Transition Services Agreement, Transitional Trademark License Agreement, Intellectual Property Matters Agreement and Commercial Services Agreement, under which each party granted certain licenses to the other party with respect to certain intellectual property rights and technology transferred by us in the Enterprise Sale and retained by us after the consummation of the sale of our Enterprise Business. We also agreed not to compete with the Enterprise Business for four years following the closing of the transaction. In addition, we and Buyer agreed to indemnify each other for losses arising from certain covenant breaches under the Purchase Agreement and certain liabilities expressly assumed or retained by the relevant indemnifying party.

INDUSTRY BACKGROUND
We live in an increasingly digitally interconnected and mobile world that is driving profound changes for consumers, causing them to react to the following trends:
 Adoption of online lifestyle is global and continues to grow. According to IDC, there were over 4 billion Internet users in 2020, of which the number of mobile-only Internet users is expected to grow at an approximate 8% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) from 2020 to 2024. Furthermore, Frost & Sullivan estimates there were over 6 billion Internet-connected devices worldwide in 2020. This significant growth in the mobile install base is driving the ubiquity of the Internet and online browsing.
Consumers everywhere are living more of their everyday lives online, thereby expanding their digital footprint. Consumers are more comfortable engaging in critical transactions, including financial transactions and medical consultations, on mobile devices and their PCs. At the same time, they are rapidly expanding their social interactions and media consumption online, while shifting data storage to cloud-based solutions to store personal photos and large amounts of private data that is accessible across any connected endpoint device. Per eMarketer, the average U.S. adult spent over 7.8 hours per day consuming digital media in 2020, representing 55% of total media consumption and an increase of 12% over the prior year. On average, one single users owns 300 online accounts, and each smartphone has 90 apps downloaded. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated digital transformation even further. According to Statista, eCommerce accounts for 20% of total retail sales in 2021, and digital transformation and mobile payments is expected to be $8.2 trillion in 2024. While unlocking consumers’ digital life allows for convenience, using an ever-increasing number of online applications and web services increases the attach surface area that cybercriminals can use to obtain, misuse, corrupt, destroy or otherwise exploit consumers’ data.
Increased attack surface combined with more organized cybercriminal heightens risk of being hacked and personal data used for profit. Cyberattacks have evolved from rudimentary malware into highly sophisticated and large-scale attacks. According to RiskBased Security, during 2020, nearly 4,000 data breaches were reported, resulting in over 37 billion records being exposed. Increasing ransomware attacks have generated billions of dollars in payments to cybercriminals and inflicted significant damage and expenses for consumers. In the fourth quarter of 2021, McAfee Labs observed an average of 354 threats per minute.
 There is a need for integrated online protection solutions that secure consumers in a connected world by offering the following:
•Comprehensive and convenient security solutions to protect consumers across their digital footprint. Consumers have an increasingly expanding digital presence as they access different online platforms and apps. These daily online interactions require solutions that are designed to meet consumers’ security, identity, and privacy protection needs at scale.
 •Online protection powered by seamless digital experience across device and platform. Consumers require holistic digital protection for themselves, their families, and their data across different devices and platforms whether they are at home, at work, or on the go. This requires an interface that is simple to set up and use and provides ongoing protection without hampering device performance and digital experience.
 •Consumer products to address privacy needs. A growing online presence exposes more personal and financial data that is targeted by malicious hackers. ForgeRock’s 2021 Consumer Identity Breach Report found a 450% surge in breaches containing usernames and passwords over 2019; translating into more than 1 billion compromised records in the U.S. alone. Users are increasingly mobile, and thus at a higher risk of connecting to unsecured public Wi-Fi connection, requiring virtual private network (“VPN”) solutions to secure personally identifiable information over unsecured networks.
 •Comprehensive threat intelligence leveraging a unique global sensor network. Protecting consumers requires comprehensive threat intelligence that can gather massive amounts of data from multiple domains, devices and environments and translate that data into actionable, real-time insights to protect against the evolving tactics and techniques of cybercriminals. It is challenging for cybersecurity vendors to accomplish this without a systematic approach that integrates real-time data collection, machine learning model training and feedback across a vast global network of sensors deployed in protected devices and networks.

OUR TECHOLOGY
 We deploy the latest technologies to maintain our competitive advantage in our product offerings as well as to design a personalized digital experience for consumers that drive customer engagement, satisfaction, and retention.
Quality of Our Protection and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning
Our solutions seek to defend against a wide range of threats by using technology that leverages a combination of threat intelligence, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Unlike other alternatives that rely only on artificial intelligence, our approach minimizes false positives while detecting a wide range of threats, including new zero-day threats.
 Our solutions are enhanced by our Global Threat Intelligence Telemetry from detected events across the product portfolio in addition to structural and behavioral feature vectors from telemetry collected through our network of threat sensors. This telemetry enables McAfee to understand the blueprint of threats for which we do not necessarily possess the sample but can identify based on behavioral and structural vectors which improves our efficacy in detecting zero-day threats.
 Our Machine Learning Scanner provides two options for performing automated analysis—on the device or in the cloud. The former uses machine learning on customer systems to determine whether existing and incoming files match known malware. Our cloud-based machine learning scanner collects and sends file attributes and behavioral information to the machine-learning system in the cloud for malware analysis, without transmitting personally identifiable information.
 Anti-Malware Engine
 Our anti-malware engine is the core component of our award-winning products. Using patented technology, the engine analyzes potentially malicious code to detect and block Trojans, viruses, worms, adware, spyware, ransomware and other threats. The engine scans files at particular points, processes, and pattern-matches malware definitions with data it finds within scanned files, decrypts, and runs malware code in an emulated environment, applies heuristic techniques to recognize new malware, and removes infectious code from legitimate files.
 Consumer Experience Innovation
 We continuously improve the digital experience for consumers through the following technologies:
 •Platform Innovation. Our continuous innovations across our online presence, ecommerce, analytics, and product platform aim towards creating the best-possible experience for consumers. Our analytics platform draws from millions of consumer engagement interactions, accumulated over years and years, provides us with the insights to craft the ideal consumer experience. We use these insights to design a comprehensive, unified seamless security experience for consumers that can be managed from any mobile device. This rich set of engagement patterns also allows us to fine-tune the purchasing process by displaying the right landing page and choosing the ideal payment provider to ensure a successful transaction. Combined with our next generation messaging system and tailored marketing campaigns, we improve customer engagement, satisfaction, as well as acquisition efficiency and retention.
 •Ability to Integrate with Our Partners. Through our ongoing collaboration with our OEM partners, we developed an integrated consumer experience that increases the conversation of potential indirect customers to our platform. Working closely with each OEM, we are continuously testing and improving each element of the consumer journey, from our tailored OEM landing pages and messaging, to our product trials, trial experience, offerings options, pricing, and shopping chart and payments experience. Additionally, we also integrated our product platform with leading telecommunication providers, retailers, as well as networking equipment manufacturers to be the underlying platform for their mobile and IoT related security offerings.
 SALES AND MARKETING
Our go-to-market engine consists of a digitally-led omni-channel approach to reach the consumer at crucial moments in their purchase lifecycle including direct-to-consumer online sales, acquisition through trial pre-loads on PC OEM devices, and other indirect modes via additional partners such as mobile providers, ISPs, electronics retailers, eCommerce sites, and search providers.
•Direct-to-consumer marketing. We market directly to consumers through our website, McAfee.com, with digital sales motions and analytics-based cart conversion capabilities. We grow this channel by driving site visits and improving conversion rates.


•PC OEMs. We have a strong PC OEM partner ecosystem with major OEMs including Dell, HP, Lenovo, Asus, Fujitsu, and Samsung, in which we pre-install a 30-day free trial of our security platform. Our digital and performance marketing engine engages with the purchasing customer to highlight the value of the security platform and convert the consumer to a direct McAfee customer. In some cases, PC OEMs preinstall a one-year or longer subscription and the OEM pays McAfee a royalty. During the subscription lifecycle, McAfee engages the consumer with our digital marketing engine to convert the consumer to a McAfee direct-to-customer subscriber at the end of the initial subscription period. Increases in OEM PC shipments and free-trial conversion rates have been key drivers of growth in this channel.
 •Retail and eCommerce. We partner with major retailers worldwide including Office Depot, Staples, Walmart, Sam’s Club, MediaMarkt, Best Buy, and Amazon, to offer consumers a McAfee subscription for purchase through the retailer stores and eCommerce websites. During the subscription lifecycle McAfee engages the consumer with our digital marketing engine to convert the consumer to a McAfee direct-to-consumer subscriber at the end of the initial subscription period.
 •Network Providers. We partner with major service providers worldwide including Verizon, T-Mobile, Lumen, Telefonica, NTT Docomo, Softbank, British Telecom, and Sky, to offer our mobile security and SHP products through the service providers. In some cases, we also partner with the service providers to integrate and bundle one or more of our security products into their mobile product value added service offerings. In addition to our partnerships with service providers, we partner with Samsung to pre-install one or more of our security products on their smartphones.
 •Search Providers. McAfee also partners with search engine providers to integrate our secure web search products. Through our WebAdvisor product we protect consumers by advising what websites are safe versus what websites are risky.
 Our omni-channel approach and strong partnerships work together to increase our presence at key moments of purchase and security engagement for consumers, allowing us to drive customer engagement and acquisition of new subscribers.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 Our intellectual property is an important and vital asset of the company that enables us to develop, market, and sell our products and services and enhance our competitive position. We rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
 We maintain an internal patent program to identify inventions that provide the basis for new patent applications in areas of importance to our business. As of December 25, 2021, we had approximately 1,235 issued U.S. patents, in addition to approximately 735 issued foreign patents, which generally relate to inventive aspects of our products and technology. The duration of our issued patents is determined by the laws of the issuing country.

Also, these protections may not preclude competitors from independently developing products with functionality or features similar to our products.
 In certain cases, we license intellectual property from third parties for use in our products and generally must rely on those third parties to protect the licensed rights. This can include open source software, which is subject to limited proprietary rights. While the ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our success, we believe our business is not materially dependent on any individual patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, license, or other intellectual property right. For information on the risks associated with our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A.
 THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS
 We are heavily reliant on our technology and infrastructure to provide our products and services to our customers. For example, we host many of our products using third-party data center facilities, and we do not control the operation of these facilities. In addition, we rely on certain technology that we license from third parties, including third-party commercial software and open source software, which is used with certain of our solutions. For information on the risks associated with our dependence on such third-party service providers, please see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A.
GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION
 We collect, use, store or disclose an increasingly high volume, variety, and velocity of personal information, including from employees and customers, in connection with the operation of our business, particularly, in relation to our identity and information protection offerings, which rely on large data repositories of personal information and consumer transactions. The personal information we process is subject to an increasing number of federal, state, local, and foreign laws regarding privacy and data security. For information on the risks associated with complying with privacy and data security laws, please see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A.
EMPLOYEE & HUMAN CAPITAL
 Protecting all that matters demands constant innovation. Doing our job well requires building a workplace that embraces individuality, encourages different perspectives, and welcomes a range of experiences to boost real innovation, creativity, and strategic problem-solving. But it’s not just the right thing to do for business—it’s about every person’s innate right to be their true self and belong.
 Building a more inclusive, sustainable world starts within our walls. We believe that when we mirror the varying perspectives of the outside world, we are stronger, more innovative, and better positioned to solve tomorrow’s toughest cybersecurity challenges. Our approach starts with our hiring and interview practices, but representation isn’t enough. Once people walk through our open door, we ensure all life experiences are not just valued, but accepted and encouraged. Only when people feel a deep sense of belonging can they thrive.
 To solve tomorrow’s cybersecurity challenges, we know that our industry needs a more diverse, innovative workforce. To fulfill our mission to protect all that matters, we stand firm in our commitment to drive this change. But first, we must understand who we are today to define our journey ahead. As of December 25, 2021, McAfee employed 2,262 employees in 32 countries worldwide.

To contribute a more diverse workforce to the cybersecurity industry, we know that we will need to exercise genuine, authentic, and transparent recruiting and hiring practices aligned with our values. That’s why we support techniques and programs designed specifically to connect us with people of all backgrounds:
 •We write clear, searchable, and applicable job descriptions for candidates of all backgrounds. By leveraging the only augmented writing platform that addresses language as well as content, all candidates can find and understand our open roles.
 •We assemble a diverse hiring panel for every role, so each candidate is considered from varying perspectives.
 •To plant a firm cultural foundation and minimize any unconscious bias, we train all recruiters and hiring managers to use our values-based behavioral interview approach.


•Our internship program serves as the training ground for top talent around the world, welcoming qualified, interested students of all backgrounds
 Real collaboration, innovation, and impact happens in workplaces where you can express yourself authentically. That’s why we work hard to ensure life at McAfee is one where our employees can be authentic, engage with others, and reach the best versions of themselves, both at the office and away from it:
 •We sponsor six McAfee Communities to support members and allies within each of our African Heritage, Veterans, Latino, Women, Pride, and Differently Abled communities
 •We ensure fair and equal compensation based on contributions and impact to the company through our annual pay parity analysis
 •We provide a Diversity Impact analysis to ensure that at a minimum, any promotion or rewards are representative of each diverse group’s population within the organization
 •We focus our global benefits strategy on providing inclusive and family friendly benefits
