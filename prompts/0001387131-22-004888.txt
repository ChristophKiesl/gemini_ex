ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

      Overview
     Cypress Environmental Partners, L.P. (“we”, “us”, “our”, the “Partnership”) is a Delaware limited partnership formed in September 2013. Our suite of services includes inspection, water treatment, and other environmental services that help our customers protect people, property, infrastructure, and the environment with a focus on safety and sustainability. We work closely with our customers to help them protect the environment, property, and people. Our services also help our clients comply with increasingly complex federal and state environmental and safety rules and regulations. The substantial majority of our environmental services are required services under various federal and state laws. Trading of our common units began in January 2014 on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “CELP”.
     Our business is organized into two reportable segments: (1) Inspection Services (“Inspection Services”), comprising the TIR Entities’ operations; and (2) Water and Environmental Services (“Environmental Services”), representing the water treatment activities of our water treatment entities. 

 The Inspection Services segment generates revenue primarily by providing essential environmental services, including inspection and integrity services on a variety of infrastructure assets such as midstream pipelines, gathering systems, and distribution systems. These services are offered on existing infrastructure as well as new construction. This segment generally follows a just in time (“JIT”) business model whereby we only hire inspectors when we have work to perform for a customer. We hire these inspectors as W-2 employees from our proprietary database based upon qualifications, certifications, and experience. These inspectors utilize their own four-wheel drive vehicles and we therefore do not have substantial capital expenditure requirements. Services include nondestructive examination (“NDE”), in-line inspection support, pig tracking, data gathering, and supervision of third-party contractors. Our revenues in this segment are driven primarily by the number of inspectors that perform services for our customers and the fees that we charge for those services, which depend on the type, skills, technology, equipment, and number of inspectors used on a particular project, the nature of the project, and the duration of the project. The number of inspectors engaged on projects is driven by the type of project, prevailing market rates, the age and condition of customers’ assets including pipelines, gas plants, compression stations, pump stations, storage facilities, and gathering and distribution systems including the legal and regulatory requirements relating to the inspection and maintenance of those assets. We also bill our customers for per diem charges, mileage, and other reimbursement items. We generally do not earn any margin on pass-through expenses such as per diem charges and mileage that we offer to our field inspectors who travel away from their residence. Revenue and costs in this segment are subject to seasonal variations and interim activity may not be indicative of yearly activity, considering that many of our customers develop yearly operating budgets and enter into contracts with us during the winter season for work to be performed during the remainder of the year. Additionally, inspection work throughout the United States during the winter months (especially in the northern states) may be hampered or delayed due to inclement weather.
     The Environmental Services segment owns and operates nine (9) water treatment facilities with ten (10) EPA Class II injection wells in the Bakken shale region of the Williston Basin in North Dakota. We wholly-own eight of these water treatment facilities and we own a 25% interest in the other facility that we manage. These water treatment facilities are connected to thirteen (13) pipeline gathering systems, including two (2) that we developed and own. We specialize in the treatment, recovery, separation, and disposal of waste byproducts generated by our customers during the lifecycle of an oil and natural gas well to protect the environment and our drinking water. All of the water treatment facilities utilize specialized equipment, technology, and remote monitoring to minimize the facilities’ downtime and increase the facilities’ efficiency for peak utilization. Revenue is generated on a fixed-fee per barrel basis for receiving, separating, filtering, recovering, processing, and injecting produced and flowback water. We also sell recovered oil, receive fees for pipeline transportation of water, and receive fees from a partially owned water treatment facility for management and staffing services.
     The volume of water processed at our water treatment facilities is driven by water volume generated from existing oil and natural gas wells during their useful lives and new oil wells that are drilled and completed. Our customers’ willingness to invest in new drilling is determined by a number of factors, the most important of which are the current and projected prices of oil; the cost to drill and operate a well; the availability and cost of capital; and environmental and governmental regulations. We generally expect the level of drilling to correlate with long-term trends in prices of oil.
     Our Relationship with Holdings
     All of the equity interests in our general partner are indirectly owned by Holdings and its affiliates. Holdings is owned by Charles C. Stephenson, Jr.; entities related to Mr. Stephenson’s family; his daughter Cynthia A. Field; and a company controlled by our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, Peter C. Boylan III. As the owners of our general partner and the direct or indirect owners of 64% of our outstanding common units and all of our outstanding preferred units, Holdings and its affiliates have a strong alignment of interests with our noncontrolling unitholders.
       6 
 
     Business Strategies
     Our principal business objective is to build a diversified partnership providing essential environmental services. We pursue the following business strategies:
    
● | Inspection Services. We strive to position ourselves as a trusted provider of high-quality essential inspection services. Over the last few years, new laws have been enacted in the United States that, in the future, will require customers to undertake more frequent and more extensive inspections of their energy infrastructure and pipeline assets. Additionally, a significant portion of the pipeline infrastructure in North America was installed decades ago and is therefore more susceptible to degradation requiring more frequent inspections. Our clients require ongoing maintenance and integrity work on their aging pipelines and other energy infrastructure. Our business is not immune to economic changes in the energy industry; however, we strive to grow organically by acquiring new customers and additional work from existing customers. Today, we estimate that we serve less than 8% of the available potential customers in the energy industry.

● | Environmental Services. This segment represents a small percentage of our overall business and our primary focus remains on inspection and related integrity services. We have no plans to build new facilities and may divest one or more of our facilities. We remain an approved vendor for many prestigious E&P companies that demand very high standards from their vendors. Although the oil and gas industry is cyclical in nature, we currently derive a significant portion of our volume and revenue from existing oil wells. When customers complete new wells near our facilities, we may have the opportunity to treat additional volumes of water. We strive to capitalize on the continued demand for removal, treatment, storage and disposal of flowback and produced water by positioning ourselves as a trusted, dependable provider of safe, high-quality water and environmental services to our customers. We currently have 13 pipelines connected to six of our water treatment facilities. Pipeline water was 54% of the total water volume in 2021.

            7 
 
 Our Business Segments
     Our business operates in two reportable segments: (1) Inspection Services, comprising the TIR Entities’ operations, and (2) Water and Environmental Services (“Environmental Services”), consisting of water treatment activities.      Inspection Services
     Overview. The Inspection Services segment provides independent inspection, integrity, and nondestructive examination services to energy and utility customers. We inspect and test infrastructure assets including pipelines, gathering and distribution systems, storage facilities, gas plants, refineries, petrochemical facilities, liquefied natural gas facilities, compression stations, and pumping stations. Our mission is to provide quality environmental services in a safe, professional, ethical, and cost-effective manner that can be tailored to add value for our clients throughout the life of their assets.
     We have entered into an agreement with CF Inspection, a nationally certified woman-owned business affiliated with one of Holdings’ owners and a Director of our General Partner. CF Inspection allows us to offer various services to clients that require the services of an approved Women’s Business Enterprise (“WBE”), as CF Inspection is certified as a National Women’s Business Enterprise by the Women’s Business Enterprise National Council. We own 49% of CF Inspection and Cynthia A. Field, an affiliate of Holdings and a Director of our General Partner, owns the remaining 51% of CF Inspection.
     Operations. Upstream, midstream, downstream, public utility companies, and other pipeline operators are required by federal and state law and regulation to inspect their pipelines, infrastructure assets, and gathering systems on a regular basis in order to protect the environment and ensure public safety. At the beginning of an engagement, our personnel meet with the customer to determine the scope of the project and determine related staffing needs. We then develop a customized staffing plan utilizing our proprietary database of professionals and other recruitment methods. Our inspectors have significant industry experience and are certified to meet the qualification requirements of both the customer and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”). We utilize a just in time (“JIT”) business model whereby we generally only hire an inspector when we have a billable assignment with a client. As the industry continues to adopt new technology, demand has increased for inspectors with greater technical skills and computer proficiencies. Our customers require inspectors to undergo specific training and certifications prior to performing inspection work on their projects. We utilize a number of accrediting agencies including but not limited to the National Center for Construction Education and Research and Veriforce training curricula to train and evaluate employees. In addition to assignment-specific training, welding inspectors and coating inspectors also must meet special certification requirements.
     PHMSA recently issued new rules that impose several new requirements on operators of onshore gas transmission systems and hazardous liquids pipelines. The new rules expand requirements to address risks to pipelines outside of environmentally sensitive and populated areas. In addition, the rules make changes to integrity management requirements, including emphasizing the use of in-line inspection technology. The new rules took effect on July 1, 2020 with various implementation phases over a period of years. Our parent company’s ownership interests continue to remain fully aligned with our unitholders, as our General Partner and insiders collectively own approximately 76% of our total common and preferred units.
     In 2021 and 2020, we employed as W-2 employees an average of 456 and 730 inspectors, respectively. Substantially all of our inspection work was performed in the United States. Our scope of services includes the following:
    
● | Miscellaneous inspection including, but not limited to, welds, coatings, cathodic protection, utilities, and safety, on existing and new construction ; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Maintenance inspection (third-party pipeline periodic inspection to comply with PHMSA regulations);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Project coordination (construction or maintenance coordination for in-line inspection services projects);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ILI Pig Tracking Services (mapping and tracking of third-party pipeline cleaning and inspection units called Pipeline Inspection Gauge (“Pig”));
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Above Ground Marker (“AGM”) Global Positioning System (“GPS”) surveys;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Excavation profile survey, anomaly dig staking, and as-built documentation;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pipeline depth of cover and GPS centerline surveys;
--+----------------------------------------------------

                8 
 
    
● | Pipeline marker placement and installation;
--+--------------------------------------------


● | Various Non-Destructive Examination ("NDE") inspections including but not limited to Phased Array Ultrasonic Testing, Optical Emission Spectroscopy, Positive Material Identification, Instrumented Indentation Testing and automated metal loss mapping to map and evaluate pipeline imperfections;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | External and/or Internal Corrosion Direct Assessment;
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | Stress Corrosion Cracking Direct Assessment; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | Related data management services.
--+----------------------------------

      Environmental Services
     Overview. The Environmental Services segment owns and operates nine (9) water treatment facilities with ten (10) EPA Class II injection wells in the Bakken shale region of the Williston Basin in North Dakota. We wholly-own eight of these water treatment facilities and we own a 25% interest in the remaining facility we manage. These water treatment facilities are connected to thirteen (13) pipeline gathering systems, including two (2) that we developed and own. We specialize in the treatment, recovery, separation, and disposal of waste byproducts generated during the lifecycle of an oil and natural gas well to protect the environment and our drinking water. During 2021, 98% of our volumes were produced water from existing wells (as opposed to flowback water from the development of new wells) and 54% of our volumes were delivered via pipeline. Our 25% owned facility had 99% produced water and 97% was delivered via pipeline in 2021. We currently serve approximately 45 customers. All of our facilities utilize specialized technology, equipment and remote monitoring to minimize the facilities’ downtime and increase the facilities’ efficiency for peak utilization. We also sell recovered oil, receive fees for pipeline transportation of water, and receive fees from Arnegard for management and staffing services.
     Operations. The Environmental Services segment generates revenue by providing the following services:
    
● | Produced water management. We treat and inject naturally-occurring water for our customers that is extracted during the oil production process. This produced water is generated during the entire lifecycle of an oil well. While the level of hydrocarbon production declines over the life of a well, the amount of produced water may decline at a slower rate or, in some cases, may even increase. The customer separates the produced water from the production stream and either transports it to one of our water treatment facilities by truck or pipeline, or contracts with a trucking company to transport it to one of our water treatment facilities. Once we receive the water at one of our water treatment facilities, we filter and treat the water and then inject it into our injection wells at depths of at least 5,000 feet after recovering any skim oil. We periodically sample, test, and assess produced water to determine its chemistry so that we can properly treat the water with the appropriate chemicals that maximize oil separation and the life of our wells.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Flowback water management. We also inject flowback water produced by our customers from hydraulic fracturing operations during the completion of new oil wells. The owner of the oil well typically either transports the flowback water to one of our facilities via pipeline or truck. Once the water is received at our facility, we treat the water through a combination of separation tanks, gun barrels, and chemical processes. The water is then injected into the class II EPA injection well at depths of at least 5,000 feet after recovering the skim oil. We believe our approach to scientifically and methodically filtering and treating the flowback water prior to injecting it into our wells helps extend the life of our wells and furthers our reputation as an environmentally-conscious service provider.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Residual oil sales. Before we inject flowback and/or produced water into our injection wells, we separate the residual oil and sell it to third parties.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Facility management. In addition to the facilities we wholly-own, we own a 25% interest in an additional facility in North Dakota that we manage. Our responsibilities in managing this facility include operations, billing, collections, insurance, maintenance, repairs, and sales and marketing. We are compensated for the management of this facility based on a percentage of the gross revenue of the facility or a minimum monthly fee.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        9 
 
     The majority of the water processed at our water treatment facilities is derived from produced water that is generated throughout the life of the oil well. In 2021 and 2020, produced water represented 98% and 99%, respectively, of our total barrels of water treated.
     In general, each of our water treatment facilities is open every day of the year, with some being open by appointment only. Over time, the volumes processed at each individual facility fluctuate based on changes in the level of activity near the facility. We have in the past temporarily closed individual facilities when the volumes at the facilities were low, and we have often reopened these facilities when market conditions near those facilities improved. We may in the future temporarily close individual facilities again. If market activity near an individual facility remains low for an extended period of time, we may consider permanently closing that facility, which would require us to incur certain asset retirement costs. We may also consider divestitures.
     Some of our locations include onsite offices and sleeping quarters. We supplement our operations with various automated technologies to improve their efficiency and safety. We have installed 24-hour digital video monitoring and recording systems at each facility. These systems allow us to track operations and unloading activities, as well as to identify customers present at our facilities. We believe that our commitment to operating our facilities with sophisticated technology and automation contributes to our enhanced operating margins and provides our customers with increased safety and regulatory compliance. Our facilities have been inspected and approved by several of our publicly traded customers that have stringent approval standards and field audits performed by their Environmental, Health and Safety groups.
     Principal Customers
     Inspection Services
     Customers of our Inspection Services segment are principally owners and operators of pipelines and other infrastructure or public utility/local distribution companies that provide natural gas to homes and businesses. In 2021 and 2020, this segment had approximately 44 and 59 customers, respectively. The five largest customers in this segment generated 71% and 59% of the segment’s revenue in 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2021 and 2020, we had two customers that individually accounted for more than 10% of the segment’s revenues. In 2021 and 2020, Pacific Gas and Electric Company accounted for 36% and 21%, respectively, of the segment's revenues.     Environmental Services
     Environmental Services segment customers are primarily E&P companies that own, drill, and operate oil wells in North Dakota. These customers include publicly traded energy companies, independents, trucking companies, and third-party purchasers of residual oil. In each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, this segment had approximately 45 customers. Our ten largest customers generated 90% of the segment’s revenue in each of 2021 and 2020. In each of 2021 and 2020, we had four customers that individually accounted for more than 10% of the segment’s revenues.
       10 
 
     Market
     There is a large market of owners of pipelines and energy infrastructure, and there are many entities that we do not currently provide inspection and integrity services to. We estimate that we serve less than 8% of the available market. We continue to focus on sales efforts, both to existing and prospective new customers. We have continued to make investments in our account management and business development teams.     Competition
     Inspection Services
     Reputation, safety statistics, financial strength, and quality are important to our current and potential customers. The inspection services business is highly competitive. Our competition consists primarily of three types of companies: independent inspection firms, engineering and construction firms, and diversified inspection service firms. Diversified inspection firms may inspect, for example, electric and nuclear facilities in addition to pipelines and related facilities. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our business include gaining and maintaining customer approval to service their pipelines, facilities and gathering systems, the ability to recruit and retain qualified experienced inspectors with multiple skills and nondestructive examination experience, safety record, insurance, financial strength, inspector training, insurance, reputation, dependability of service, customer service, and price. We compete with many other inspection firms to recruit and retain talented inspectors.     Environmental Services
     The Environmental Services business is highly competitive with relatively low barriers to entry. Our competition includes smaller regional companies. In addition, we face competition from our customers, who may have the option of using internal processing methods instead of outsourcing to us or to another third-party company. Many E&P companies also own their own water treatment facilities and water gathering systems, and therefore do not send their produced water to third parties for processing. We believe the principal competitive differentiating factors in our businesses include gaining and maintaining customer approval of water treatment facilities, location of facilities in relation to customer activity, reputation, safety record, reliability of service, track record of environmental and regulatory compliance, customer service, insurance coverage, and price.     Seasonality
     Inspection Services
     Inspection work varies depending upon the geographic location of our customers. The months from April to October are historically the most active for our inspection services in the United States as our customers focus on completing projects by year-end. Business has historically been slower in the period from November through March, due to the holiday season, weather, and the budgeting cycles of our customers. We believe our presence across various regions in the United States helps mitigate the seasonality of our business. Our public utility operations in California and other locations with moderate climates tend to experience less seasonal volatility.     Environmental Services
     The overall operations and financial performance of our North Dakota operations are affected by seasonality. The volume of water processed in the Bakken Shale region of the Williston Basin in North Dakota tends to be lower in the winter, due to heavy snow and cold temperatures, and in the spring, due to heavy rains and muddy conditions that may lead to road restrictions and weight limits that can impact business. The growing percentage of piped water to our facilities has mitigated some of these weather-related matters. The amount of residual oil is also less prevalent and more difficult to extract during the winter months.
     Regulation of the Industry
     Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Matters
     Our operations and the operations of our customers are subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety, the discharge of materials, and environmental protection. These laws and regulations may, among other things, require the acquisition of permits for regulated activities; govern the amounts and types of substances that may be released into the environment in connection with our operations; restrict the treatment methods of waste byproducts; limit or prohibit our or our customers’ activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, wilderness areas, or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species; require investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate pollution conditions caused by our current or former operations; and impose specific standards addressing worker protections. Numerous governmental agencies issue regulations to implement and enforce these laws, for which compliance is often costly and difficult. The violation of these laws and regulations may result in the denial or revocation of permits, issuance of corrective action orders, assessment of administrative and civil penalties, and even criminal prosecution.
     We do not anticipate that compliance with existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations will have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. However, these rules and regulations are constantly evolving, and amendments thereto could result in a material effect on our operations and financial position. For instance, in January 2021, the Biden administration issued an executive order directing all federal agencies to review and take action to address any federal regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies and any similar agency actions promulgated during the prior administration that may be inconsistent with the current administration’s policies. As a result, it is unclear the degree to which certain recent regulatory developments may be modified or rescinded. The executive order also established an Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases (“Working Group”), which is called on to, among other things, develop methodologies for calculating the “social cost of carbon,” “social cost of nitrous oxide” and “social cost of methane.” Final recommendations from the Working Group are due no later than January 2022. Further regulation of air emissions, as well as uncertainty regarding the future course of regulation, could eventually reduce the demand for oil and natural gas. Also in January 2021, the Biden administration issued an executive order focused on addressing climate change (the “2021 Climate Change Executive Order”). Among other things, the 2021 Climate Change Executive Order directed the Secretary of the Interior to pause new oil and natural gas leasing on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review of the federal permitting and leasing practices, consider whether to adjust royalties associated with coal, oil, and gas resources extracted from public lands and offshore waters, or take other appropriate action, to account for corresponding climate costs. The 2021 Climate Change Executive Order also directed the federal government to identify “fossil fuel subsidies” to take steps to ensure that, to the extent consistent with applicable law, federal funding is not directly subsidizing fossil fuels. Legal challenges to the suspension have already been filed and are currently pending.
       11 
 
     Further, while we may occasionally receive citations from environmental regulatory agencies for minor violations, such citations occur in the ordinary course of our business and are generally not material to our operations. However, it is possible that substantial costs for compliance or penalties for non-compliance may be incurred in the future. It is also possible that other developments, such as the adoption of stricter environmental laws, regulations, and enforcement policies, could result in additional costs or liabilities that we cannot currently quantify. Moreover, changes in environmental laws could limit our customers’ businesses or encourage our customers to handle and dispose of oil and natural gas wastes in other ways, which, in either case, could reduce the demand for our services and adversely impact our business.
     The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations and the operations of our customers are subject and for which compliance in the future may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or future cash flows.
     Hazardous substances and wastes. Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and release of hazardous substances, solid wastes, hazardous wastes, and petroleum hydrocarbons. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and may impose strict joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of affected areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. We may handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes (including substances disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or remediate contaminated property (including groundwater contamination, whether from prior owners or operators or other historical activities or spills). These laws may also require us to conduct natural resource damage assessments and pay penalties for such damages. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants into the environment. These laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for our acts that were in compliance with applicable laws at the time the acts were performed.
     Petroleum hydrocarbons and other substances arising from oil and natural gas-related activities have been disposed of or released on or under many of our sites. At some of our facilities, we have conducted and continue to conduct monitoring or remediation of known soil and groundwater contamination. We will continue to perform such monitoring and remediation of known contamination, including any post remediation groundwater monitoring that may be required, until the appropriate regulatory standards have been achieved. These monitoring and remediation efforts are usually overseen by state environmental regulatory agencies.
     In the future, we may also accept for disposal solids that are subject to the requirements of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and comparable state statutes. While RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation, and disposal of hazardous wastes. Most E&P waste is exempt from stringent regulation as a hazardous waste under RCRA. None of our facilities are currently permitted to accept hazardous wastes for disposal, and we take precautions to help ensure that hazardous wastes do not enter or are not disposed of at our facilities. Some wastes handled by us that currently are exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as “hazardous wastes” under RCRA or other applicable statutes. For example, in May 2016, a nonprofit environmental group filed suit in the federal district court for the District of Columbia, seeking a declaratory judgment directing the EPA to review and reconsider the RCRA E&P waste exemption. EPA and the environmental group entered into an agreement that was formalized in a consent decree issued by the U.S. District court for the District of Columbia in December 2016. Under the decree, the EPA was required to propose a rulemaking for revisions of certain of its regulations pertaining to E&P wastes or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. After undertaking its review, EPA signed a determination in 2019 concluding that it does not need to regulate E&P wastes, and specifically “drilling fluids, produced waters, and other wastes associated with the exploration, development, or production of oil, gas or geothermal energy,” because the states are adequately regulating E&P wastes under the Subtitle D provisions of RCRA. However, if the RCRA E&P waste exemption is repealed or modified in the future, we could become subject to more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements.
     We are required to obtain permits for the disposal of E&P waste as part of our operations. State permits can restrict pressure, size, and location of disposal operations, impose limits on the types and amount of waste a facility may receive and the overall capacity of a waste disposal facility. States may add additional restrictions on the operations of a disposal facility when a permit is renewed or amended. As these regulations change, our permit requirements could become more stringent and may require material expenditures at our facilities or impose significant restraints or financial assurances on our operations. In the course of our operations, some of our equipment may be exposed to naturally occurring radiation associated with oil and natural gas deposits, and this exposure may result in the generation of wastes containing Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials, or NORM. NORM wastes exhibiting trace levels of naturally occurring radiation in excess of established state standards are subject to special handling and disposal requirements, and any storage vessels, piping, and work area affected by NORM may be subject to remediation or restoration requirements. It is possible that we may incur costs or liabilities associated with elevated levels of NORM.
     Safe Drinking Water Act. Our underground injection operations are subject to the Safe Drinking Water Act, or SDWA, as well as analogous state laws and regulations. Under the SDWA, the EPA established the Underground Injection Control, or UIC, program, which established the minimum program requirements for state and local programs regulating underground injection activities. The UIC program includes requirements for permitting, testing, monitoring, record keeping and reporting of injection well activities, as well as a prohibition against the migration of fluid containing any contaminant into underground sources of drinking water. State regulations require us to obtain a permit from the applicable regulatory agencies to operate our underground injection wells. Any leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells could cause degradation of fresh groundwater resources, potentially resulting in suspension of our UIC permit, issuance of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of the affected resource and imposition of liability by third parties for property damages and personal injuries. In addition, storage of residual crude oil collected as part of the saltwater injection process prior to sale could impose liability on us in the event that the entity to which the oil was transferred fails to manage and, as necessary, dispose of residual crude oil in accordance with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety laws.
     Our customers are subject to these same regulations. While these largely result in their needing our services, some waste regulations could have the opposite effect. For instance, some states, have considered laws mandating the recycling of flowback and produced water. If such laws are passed, our customers may divert some saltwater to recycling operations that may have otherwise been disposed of at our facilities.
     Oil Pollution Act of 1990. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA, as amended, establishes strict liability for owners and operators of facilities that are the site of a release of oil into regulated waters. The OPA also imposes ongoing requirements on owners or operators of facilities that handle certain quantities of oil, including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill. We handle oil at many of our facilities, and if a release of oil into the regulated waters occurred at one of our facilities, we could be liable for cleanup costs and damages under the OPA.
       12 
 
     Water discharges. The federal Water Pollution Control Act, referred to as the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters and impose requirements affecting our ability to conduct activities in regulated waters and wetlands. Pursuant to the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws, permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into regulated waters, and permits or coverage under general permits must also be obtained to authorize discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of industrial facilities, including many of our facilities. The Clean Water Act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. Spill prevention, control, and countermeasure requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of regulated waters in the event of a hydrocarbon storage tank spill, rupture, or leak. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations.
     We believe that compliance with existing permits and regulatory requirements under the Clean Water Act and state counterparts will not have a material adverse effect on our business. Future changes to permits or regulatory requirements under the Clean Water Act, however, could adversely affect our business.
     Endangered species. The federal Endangered Species Act, or ESA, restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Many states also have analogous laws designed to protect endangered or threatened species. Additionally, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2011, the Fish and Wildlife Service was required to make a determination on the listing of more than 250 species as endangered or threatened under the ESA by the end of the Fish and Wildlife Service’s 2018 fiscal year. The Fish and Wildlife Service did not meet that deadline but continues to consider whether to list additional species under the ESA. Although current listings have not had a material impact on our operations, the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species under the ESA or similar state laws could limit our ability to expand our operations and facilities or could force us to incur material additional costs. Moreover, listing such species under the ESA or similar state laws could indirectly, but materially, affect our business by imposing constraints on our customers’ operations, including the curtailment of new drilling or a refusal to allow a new pipeline to be constructed.
     Air emissions. Some of our operations also result in emissions of regulated air pollutants. The Clean Air Act, or CAA, and analogous state laws require permits for and impose other restrictions on facilities that have the potential to emit substances into the atmosphere above certain specified quantities or in a manner that could adversely affect environmental quality. Failure to obtain a permit or to comply with permit requirements could result in the imposition of substantial administrative, civil, and even criminal penalties. We do not believe that any of our operations are subject to CAA permitting or regulatory requirements for major sources of air emissions, but some of our facilities could be subject to state “minor source” air permitting requirements and other state regulatory requirements for air emissions. 
     Our customers’ operations may be subject to existing and future CAA permitting and regulatory requirements that could have a material effect on their operations. The EPA recently approved and proposed new CAA rules requiring additional emissions controls and practices for oil and natural gas production wells, including wells that are the subject of hydraulic fracturing operations. The rules also establish new emission requirements for compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks, natural gas processing and certain other equipment used in the hydraulic fracturing process. These rules may increase the costs to our customers of developing and producing hydrocarbons, and as a result, may have an indirect and adverse effect on the amount of oilfield waste delivered to our facilities by our customers.
     Climate change. The EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that, for example, require certain large stationary sources to obtain Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, pre-construction permits and Title V operating permits for greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the United States, including, among others, certain onshore oil and natural gas processing and fractionating facilities, which was expanded in October 2015 to include onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting activities and natural gas transmission pipelines. Additionally, the U.S. Congress has, in the past, considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs. Most of these cap-and-trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and natural gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances that correspond to their annual emissions of GHGs. In addition, in December 2015, over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (the “Paris Agreement”). The agreement entered into force in November 2016 after more than 70 countries, including the United States, ratified or otherwise consent to be bound by the agreement. In June 2018, President Trump announced that the United States plans to withdraw from the agreement and formally initiated the withdrawal process in November 2019, which resulted in an effective exit date of November 2020. However, the Biden administration issued the aforementioned 2021 Climate Change Executive Order that, among other things, commenced the process for the U.S. reentering the Paris Agreement. The U.S. officially rejoined the Paris Agreement on February 19, 2021. The 2021 Climate Change Executive Order also directed the Secretary of the Interior to pause new oil and natural gas leasing on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review of the federal permitting and leasing practices, consider whether to adjust royalties associated with coal, oil, and gas resources extracted from public lands and offshore waters, or take other appropriate action, to account for corresponding climate costs. The 2021 Climate Change Executive Order also directed the federal government to identify “fossil fuel subsidies” to take steps to ensure that, to the extent consistent with applicable law, federal funding is not directly subsidizing fossil fuels. Legal challenges to the suspension have already been filed and are currently pending. To the extent that the United States and other countries implement the Paris Agreement or impose other climate change regulations on the oil and natural gas industry, it could have an adverse effect on our business. The EPA and other federal and state agencies have also acted to address greenhouse gas emissions in other industries, most notably coal-fired power generation, and as a result could attempt in the future to impose additional regulations on the oil and natural gas industry.
     Additionally, our access to capital may be impacted by climate change policies as shareholders and bondholders currently invested in fossil-fuel energy companies concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-fossil fuel energy related sectors. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil-fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending and investment practices that favor "clean" power sources such as wind and solar, making those sources more attractive, and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Many of the largest U.S. banks have made "net zero" carbon emission commitments and have announced that they will be assessing their portfolios and taking steps to quantify and reduce funding to companies with carbon emissions.
     Although it is not possible at this time to estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing GHG emissions would impact our business, either directly or indirectly, any future federal or state laws or implementing regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions in areas where we operate could require us or our customers to incur increased operating costs. Regulation of GHGs could also result in a reduction in demand for and production of oil and natural gas, which would result in a decrease in demand for our services. We cannot predict with any certainty at this time how these possibilities may affect our operations, but effects could be materially adverse.
     Hydraulic fracturing. We do not conduct hydraulic fracturing operations, but we do provide treatment and disposal services with respect to the fluids used and wastes generated by our customers in such operations, which are often necessary to drill and complete new wells and maintain existing wells. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand, or other proppants and chemicals under pressure into target geological formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Presently, hydraulic fracturing is regulated primarily at the state level, typically by state oil and natural gas commissions and similar agencies. Several states, including North Dakota, where we conduct our Environmental Services business, have either adopted or proposed laws and/or regulations to require oil and natural gas operators to disclose chemical ingredients and water volumes used to hydraulically fracture wells, in addition to more stringent well construction and monitoring requirements. The chemical ingredient information is generally available to the public via online databases including fracfocus.org, and this may bring more public scrutiny to hydraulic fracturing operations.

     At the federal level, the SDWA regulates the underground injection of substances through the UIC program and generally exempts hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection.” The U.S. Congress has in recent legislative sessions considered legislation to amend the SDWA, including legislation that would repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection” and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process.
     Federal agencies have also asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process within their jurisdiction. For example, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on its intent to develop regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, and proposed effluent limitations for the disposal of wastewater from unconventional resources to publicly owned treatment works. In addition, the U.S. Department of the Interior (“DOI”) published a rule that updated existing regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands, including requirements for disclosure, well bore integrity and handling of flowback water. A U.S. District Court in Wyoming struck down this rule in June 2016; that ruling was overturned and the rule reinstated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in September 2017. However, the DOI formally rescinded the rule in December 2017.
     The EPA conducted a study of the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities on drinking water. The EPA released its final report in December 2016. The study concluded that under certain limited circumstances, hydraulic fracturing activities and related disposal and fluid management activities, could adversely affect drinking water supplies. This study and other studies that may be undertaken by the EPA or other governmental authorities, depending on their results, could spur initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or otherwise. If new federal, state or local laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements could result in delays, eliminate certain drilling and injection activities and make it more difficult or costly for our customers to perform fracturing. Any such regulations limiting or prohibiting hydraulic fracturing could reduce oil and natural gas exploration and production activities by our customers and, therefore, adversely affect our business. Such laws or regulations could also materially increase our costs of compliance and our cost of doing business by more strictly regulating how hydraulic fracturing wastes are handled or disposed.
     Occupational Safety and Health Act. We are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of employee health and safety. OSHA’s hazard communications standard requires that information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations be maintained and provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent changes. Failure to comply with these laws could lead to the assertion of third-party claims against us, civil and/or criminal fines, and changes in the way we operate our facilities that could have an adverse effect on our financial position.
     Seismic activity. Several states have acted to address a growing concern that the underground injection of water into disposal wells may have triggered seismic activity in certain areas. Any new seismic permitting requirements applicable to disposal wells would impose more stringent permitting requirements and would be likely to result in added costs to comply or, perhaps, may require alternative methods of disposing of saltwater and other fluids, which could delay production schedules and also result in increased costs. Additional regulatory measures designed to minimize or avoid damage to geologic formations may be imposed to address such concerns.
     Employees
     Inspection Services Segment
     Our Inspection Services segment utilizes a just in time (“JIT”) business model that employs a number of W-2 inspectors that varies based on client needs (we also employ technicians for services such as nondestructive examination; for purposes of this report, we generally use the term “inspectors” to refer to all of the field employees of the Inspection Services segment). We generally only employ inspectors when there is a specific billable client project to deploy them on. As of December 31, 2021, this segment employed 333 inspectors, all of whom were employed in the United States. In response to adverse market conditions in 2020 and 2021, we implemented significant cost reductions in the administrative staff that supports the Inspection Services segment, including layoffs, and temporary salary and hour reductions.
     Recruitment and retention of qualified field employees is critical to our success. We recruit via our company website, third-party recruitment websites, and our proprietary database of prospective inspectors. There are numerous competitors in the inspection business, and we must maintain competitive compensation packages in order to recruit and retain qualified inspectors. Compensation packages vary based on geographic and other factors. We offer company-paid health, dental, and vision benefits and a 401(k) match to most of our inspectors. Many of our competitors offer aggressive non-taxable compensation.
     Certain inspectors who serve one of our publicly traded public utility companies are members of a union and are covered by a collective bargaining arrangement. As of December 31, 2021, 66 inspectors were members of this union. None of our other employees are covered by collective bargaining arrangements.
     Environmental Services Segment
     Our Environmental Services segment employed 7 people at December 31, 2021, all of whom work at our North Dakota facilities. Our facilities are generally open every day of the year to serve our customers. Most of these employees have been employed with us for a number of years. Our compensation structure for field employees includes wages and health benefits. During 2020, in response to challenging market conditions, we implemented a cost reduction plan that included a combination of temporary salary reductions and a reduction in workforce.     Corporate
     As of December 31, 2021, we employed 63 people in our corporate offices. These employees provide various services, including management, business development, human resources, information technology, billing, safety, legal, payroll, and accounting, among others. The compensation cost for these employees is allocated among us and our affiliates based on estimates of the amount of time these employees spend on our businesses relative to those of our affiliates. Our primary corporate office is in Tulsa, Oklahoma and we have a smaller corporate office in Houston, Texas. Retention of high-performing employees is important to our success. We strive to recruit employees who are willing and able to perform a diverse set of responsibilities as business needs warrant.

     Our salary structure is designed to reward high performance/merit, and we historically awarded salary increases to specific employees for performance and/or market reasons, rather than awarding across-the-board cost of living increases. In early 2022 we awarded cost-of-living increases to most of our corporate employees with salaries below a certain threshold, in recognition of the fact that many of the skills these employees possess are in high demand in the marketplace. We have an annual short-term incentive plan, and the bonuses we pay under this program are heavily influenced by the financial performance of our business. In 2019, we awarded generous cash bonuses (as a result of strong financial performance), whereas in 2020, we awarded only minimal cash bonuses (as a result of lower financial performance). Executive management did not receive any bonuses in 2020. In 2021 we awarded bonuses to most of our corporate employees, in recognition of their service in helping us manage through the challenging market conditions of the past two years. We also have a long-term incentive plan, under which we grant equity awards to select key employees. These awards have been in the form of phantom restricted common units and unit appreciation rights, most of which vest over a period of 3 to 5 years. In some cases vesting is also contingent on meeting specified company performance metrics. During 2020, we implemented salary reductions for a large percentage of our corporate salaried employees in response to the adverse market conditions. These reductions ranged from 5%-40%, with our CEO at the maximum end of this range, the management team generally at the higher end of this range, and employees with lower salaries generally at the lower end of this range. During 2021 we restored these salaries to their previous levels. We offer subsidized health and related benefits and the opportunity to participate in a 401(k) plan, although we do not currently offer matching contributions to the 401(k) plan for corporate employees.
     Safety
     We have a team of professionals in our corporate offices dedicated to matters such as workplace safety and operational qualifications. During 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented our business continuity plan, which included a temporary work-from-home arrangement for most of our corporate office employees at various times during the pandemic.     Insurance Matters
     Our customers require that we maintain certain minimum levels of insurance and evaluate our insurance coverage as part of the initial and ongoing approval process they require to use our services. We also carry a variety of insurance coverages for our operations as required by law. However, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or may not cover all losses, and losses not covered by insurance would increase our costs. Also, insurance rates have been subject to wide fluctuations, and changes in coverage could result in less coverage, increases in cost, higher deductibles and retentions, and more exclusions. For example, we expect the circumstances around the near-term maturity of our Credit Agreement, which are described elsewhere in this Annual Report, to lead to significantly higher premiums for director and officer insurance and to greater limitations on the risks that are covered by such insurance.
      Our businesses can be dangerous, involving unforeseen circumstances such as environmental damage from leaks, spills, or vehicle accidents. To address the hazards inherent in our services, our insurance coverage includes business, auto liability, commercial general liability, employer’s liability, environmental and pollution, and other coverage. To address the hazards inherent in our services, insurance coverage includes employer’s liability, auto liability, employee benefits liabilities, and contractor’s pollution and other coverage. We also carry cybersecurity and crime coverage. Coverage for environmental and pollution-related losses is subject to significant limitations. We do not carry business interruption insurance, given its cost and its coverage limitations.     Available Information
