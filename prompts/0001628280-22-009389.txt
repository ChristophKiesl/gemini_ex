ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
Volta Inc. is a holding company for its wholly owned subsidiaries, Volta Charging Industries, LLC, Volta Charging, LLC, Volta Charging Services, LLC, Volta Canada Inc., Volta Charging Germany GmbH, Volta France SARL, Volta Rakko B.V., Rakko Holding B.V., and Volta Media, LLC (inactive) (collectively, the “Company” or “Volta”). Volta’s mission is to build the fueling infrastructure of the future. Volta’s vision is to create an electric vehicle (“EV”) charging network that capitalizes on and catalyzes the shift from gas cars to electric cars. Volta places its charging stations in high traffic public locations that driver and consumer behavior data suggest are stopping points in EV drivers' daily routines. Located near the entrances of the retail and other commercial facilities at these locations, the digital display screens on Volta's media enabled stations offer its media partners the opportunity to advertise to potential consumers just before they enter that facility. By both attracting EV drivers to a particular location to run an errand that was on their to-do list and providing a high impact advertising opportunity just before a purchasing decision may be made, Volta's charging stations allow it to enhance its site and media partners' core commercial interests.
Founded in 2010, Volta primarily owns, operates and maintains EV charging stations and has expanded its network across the United States to include 2,264 chargers across 23 states and territories that generated over 210,000 estimated charging sessions per month on average for year ended December 31, 2021, forming one of the most utilized charging networks in the United States on a station-by-station basis. Additionally, in 2021, Volta expanded its international footprint, opening offices in Paris, France, Berlin, Germany, and Montreal, Canada and commenced installation of its first stations in Europe.  In order to achieve its mission, Volta has invested and intends to continue investing in its workforce as it seeks to attract and retain top-level talent in a highly competitive hiring environment.
Volta’s business entails partnering with real estate and retail partners with national and regional multi-site portfolios of commercial and retail properties, as well as municipalities and local business owners, to locate and deploy its EV charging stations in premier locations. These site hosts span a wide array of industries and locations, including retail centers, grocery stores, pharmacies, movie theaters, parking lots, healthcare/medical facilities, municipalities, sport and entertainment venues, parks and recreation areas, restaurants, schools and universities, certain transit and fueling locations and office buildings and other locations. Volta generally signs long-term contracts to locate its charging stations at site host properties and grows its footprint over time as its station utilization justifies further capital investment in its EV charging infrastructure. Volta also sells charging stations to certain business partners, while continuing to perform related installation, operation and maintenance services. For both Volta-owned and partner-owned media-enabled charging stations, Volta sells media display time on the charging stations’ digital displays to its media and advertising partners. In addition, while Volta currently provides free charging services to drivers who use its charging stations (meaning that drivers can charge their EVs at no cost to them), Volta intends to introduce a business model that includes pay-for-use by the driver charging in the future, which it has begun testing in limited locations. Unlike some of its competitors in the EV charging industry, Volta’s network has the ability to draw on several sources of revenue to build earlier and stronger unit economics than other solutions currently available in the market, by tapping into multiple commercial opportunities, consisting of the sale of advertising content on its charging station digital displays to its commercial partners, installation, operation and maintenance services related to its charging stations, license or service fees from the licensing of Volta’s proprietary software tools, the sale of low-carbon fuel standard (“LCFS”) credits and, in the future, fees associated with pay-for-use by the driver charging services.
Volta focuses on optimizing its network deployment for capital and electrical grid efficiency using a data-driven approach powered by its PredictEVTM  tool. Volta is building a network that has at its core the objective of delivering the most electric miles per dollar invested.
Market Opportunity
Volta Inc. 

Volta believes the transition to electric mobility will be one of the largest macro-economic shifts in this century. Because electricity is pervasive and safely distributed, fueling can shift to a model where vehicles charge at locations where their drivers already engage in everyday activities. The stations at locations where the vehicle is parked will typically offer charging speeds matched to the expected parking duration of vehicles at the site. With the exception of occasional drives beyond a vehicle’s battery range, for many use cases, public EV charging is primarily a top-up model and the fueling experience is transitioning from being a common chore performed by having to make a dedicated and sometimes inconvenient stop, to being conveniently located within a driver’s typical daily routine. For example, EV drivers might top-up with lower speed charging while parked at a shopping center for a few hours, but choose a faster mid-speed option for visits to grocery stores, drug stores and coffee shops, as needed. Volta offers a differentiated platform that delivers the convenience of the “on your route” model of EV charging while providing additional value through its understanding of driver behavior and commerce opportunities to present a compelling marketing opportunity to its media and advertising partners. By providing an EV charging amenity that is centered on its strategic partners’ commercial goals, Volta believes its partners will be able to take better advantage of the shift to electric mobility and have a positive influence on site visitor engagement at their businesses.
The evolution of the EV market informs the evolution of the EV charging market. Volta’s success depends in large part on the ability to model demand for EV charging and deploy charging stations that meet market demand for charging speeds for a variety of EV charging capabilities. This further needs to be appropriately matched to dwell time at a particular location. As EV batteries increasingly become able to accept higher levels of charge, Volta is responding to a greater demand for DCFC chargers at certain locations, like pharmacies, that typically have shorter dwell times. Volta’s ability to keep pace with this demand and evolution in the EV marketplace in the future will be critical to its ability to generate revenue and compete successfully in a crowded competitive landscape for EV charging.
EV Charging
The EV charging market is heavily dependent on the general market for EVs, which has experienced significant recent growth in response to public demand for vehicles with greater fuel efficiency, greater performance and lower environmental emissions. Volta expects this market growth to accelerate in the future due to numerous factors, including lower upfront prices for EVs, increased EV model availability and performance, lower total cost of ownership (“TCO”) as compared to internal combustion engine (“ICE”) vehicles, increased EV battery charge capacity, increased range and availability of chargers and government incentives and regulations.
For example, automobile and battery manufacturers have substantially increased their efforts to offer EVs at a wider variety of price points and to develop batteries with higher efficiencies and lower costs. Volta expects the cost of EV batteries to continue to fall in the future, which would allow EVs to compete with and potentially outperform ICE vehicles on cost in the coming years. Efforts to date by original equipment manufacturer (“OEMs”) have already lowered the upfront costs of EVs, and Volta expects further price reductions over the next several years. As overall EV costs decline, Volta expects that more makes and models will reach TCO parity with their ICE equivalents and the TCO advantage for other types of EVs will expand.
In addition, according to Reuters, global automakers intend to expand and accelerate production of their EV offerings and associated technologies and to optimize the global EV supply chain. For example, Daimler AG has announced plans to electrify the entire Mercedes-Benz portfolio by 2030, Volkswagen expects to put 22 million EVs on the road in the next ten years and has announced over $100 billion in committed battery and EV spending. General Motors Company expects to have 30 EV models by 2025 with $30 billion in committed EV spending, Ford has announced $30 billion in committed EV spending by 2025 and BMW expects EVs to reach two million sales of purely electric vehicles by 2025. In response to the growing electrification trend, demand for public charging is also expected to increase, with Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasting demand for EV charging connectors growing by 16x from 2020 – 2030 and by 44x from 2020 – 2040 in the U.S. and by 8x from 2020 - 2030 and by 18x from 2020 - 2040 in Europe.
These advances are further bolstered by incentives and rebates offered by governments, including regulated utilities, to encourage the use of EVs in the U.S. and globally. The U.S. federal government currently offers a tax credit for qualified plug-in EVs of up to $7,500, depending on vehicle weight and battery capacity, subject to certain limitations. In the U.S., the recently enacted Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act includes $7.5 billion in funding 
Volta Inc. 

aimed at accelerating EV adoption and building out charging infrastructure. States such as California, Colorado, Delaware, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island also offer various incentives — such as rebates, grants and tax credits — to promote EV and EV supply equipment purchases. Volta believes additional rebates and grants for purchasers of EVs are currently under consideration at the federal and state level. Further, regulated utilities such as the NY Public Service Commission, which approved $700 million to fund EV charging infrastructure for multiple utilities, and Southern California Edison, which adopted a $436 million charge-ready infrastructure program, are also supporting EV infrastructure development efforts. In Europe, Regulation (EU) 2019/631 sets European fleet-wide CO2 emission targets applying from 2020, 2025 and 2030 and includes a mechanism to incentivize adoption of zero- and low-emission vehicles. In 2021, the European Commission adopted a series of legislative proposals setting out how it intends to achieve climate neutrality in the EU by 2050, including the intermediate target of an at least 55% net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Both the French and German governments offer incentives available to purchasers of qualified hybrids or EVs. The French charging infrastructure program, Advenir, was renewed with a budget of €100 million to finance more than 45,000 new charging points in France by the end of 2023. In Germany, the 2030 Climate Action Program passed in October 2019 with the goal to reach up to 1 million charging stations on German roads by 2030. 
Demand for EVs has also been encouraged by regulatory developments and changes in driver habits. Several states — including California, Oregon, New York, Maryland and Massachusetts — have adopted or proposed mandates for EVs with the goal of more than 6 million EVs on the road by 2030. It is also expected that by 2030 for Washington and by 2035 for California, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont, all new cars sold will be zero-emission vehicles, based on current requirements or government recommendations in such states. Across Europe, a number of countries have announced goals to shift to sales of only zero-emission new vehicles between 2025 and 2040. Additionally, California has enacted its Clean Miles Standard and Incentive Program aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from rideshare vehicles through electrification. Volta believes these regulations will rapidly accelerate EV adoption by drivers and fleets in the coming years.
Volta’s Solution and Go to Market Strategy
As discussed in more detail below, Volta’s solution is to provide a differentiated model that uses media and EV charging to draw drivers to Volta's site partners' locations and influence purchasing or other behavior. By choosing Volta charging stations, charging becomes more than just an amenity that a site host can offer its customers — it can serve as an independent driver of revenue, loyalty and driver engagement for site hosts. Volta’s content partners similarly benefit from access to unique locations served by Volta’s EV charging stations, reaching audiences when they are about to enter retail or commercial facilities. Finally, Volta believes its core focus on the use of sustainable technology and its EV charging stations' role in slowing climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions by enabling EV transportation closely aligns with the values of its site hosts, content partners and the drivers that use Volta chargers.
Volta’s principal products and services are its EV charging stations and related services, including its content delivery activities for its media and advertising partners. Volta’s EV charging equipment consists of a managed network of Alternate Current (“AC”) and Direct Current Fast Charging (“DCFC”) chargers equipped with digital displays (which Volta refers to as its “content-driven” or “media enabled” charging stations) and chargers without digital displays. Volta’s EV charging network is facilitated by proprietary software that operates, maintains, and monitors its EV charging stations and associated charging data. Volta remotely monitors and manages its EV charging stations to assist with driver engagement at host sites to provide EV drivers with vital station information, including charger location and availability. Volta’s content-driven charging stations also provide its commercial partners with an extensive network of digital displays in prime locations that drivers visit on a day-to-day basis.
The key elements of Volta’s business model include:
•Leasing premier space from real estate and retail partners and other site hosts to place its content-driven EV charging stations near site entrances, which are highly visible to passersby, creating a desirable platform for brands and Volta’s commercial partners to deliver their media content. Volta typically contracts with site partners to install its charging stations at host sites using either a master service agreement or a site-specific agreement. Master service agreements provide the framework for deploying Volta charging stations to 
Volta Inc. 

national partners’ sites by establishing mutual agreements with such partners to work with Volta to agree upon such national partner’s sites for installation of Volta charging stations and provides Volta with a list of opportunities with that site partner. Master service agreements also provide a pre-negotiated template for signing individual lease or license agreement for specific site opportunities, facilitating more efficient contracting once an agreement is reached on specific additional sites. Volta also enters into site specific agreements with particular site partners, which define the terms under which Volta will place charging stations on the properties controlled by such site partner and can take longer to negotiate and execute, as compared to site agreements entered into under an agreed master service agreement. In both cases, Volta typically remains responsible for the installation, operation and maintenance of the charging stations.
•Volta also sells content-driven EV charging stations to certain business partners and continues to perform the related installation, operation and maintenance services, while retaining the exclusive right to sell media display time on the media-enabled charging stations for the duration of the contract term.
•For both Volta-owned and partner-owned media-enabled charging stations, Volta also derives revenue from the sale of media display time on its charging stations. The revenue generated from the sale of advertising may allow Volta to install stations in markets or at properties where EV penetration may not be initially sufficient to support charging stations that generate revenue solely from the sale of electricity. Volta is currently testing charging fees to drivers for charging at limited locations, and, in the future Volta expects to expand its current open-access model, which provides charging at no cost to shoppers and visitors that use Volta charging stations, to include a model where drivers will pay for charging and/or will check-in on the Volta app before beginning a charging session or to continue a charging session. Over time, Volta expects to grow this share of its revenues by charging drivers for use of its stations.
•Finally, Volta derives revenue from licensing its PredictEV™ tool, a machine-learning built software tool that Volta uses for network planning, to utility companies, channel partners and other third parties as a Software as a Service (“SaaS”) offering to help them assess the impact that EV adoption and the shift to electric mobility will have on electricity demand in their service areas. The Volta team also uses its proprietary network planning tool internally to leverage a data-driven approach to expansion of its EV charging network. Combined with the Volta team’s extensive expertise in developing and operating a comprehensive, highly reliable charging network and selecting and developing quality sites for chargers, Volta believes that the PredictEV™ tool enables it to take a holistic approach to EV charging focused on changes to commerce and behavior resulting from the shift to electric mobility.
The key elements of Volta’s go-to-market strategy include:
•Behavior and Commerce. EV drivers fuel differently than drivers of gas fueled cars. Rather than going to the equivalent of a gas station, EV drivers are increasingly accustomed to having fueling opportunities provided where they are already going. Volta recognizes this fundamental shift in fueling behavior and places its stations at the entrances of the locations where those drivers go in the normal course of their day in order to maximize its station utilization.Volta also views EV charging as more than just a fueling approach - Volta is focused on creating the opportunity to develop sustainable and climate friendly EV infrastructure that allows drivers to maximize their time spent doing the things that matter most to them, while enabling Volta’s site hosts and commercial partners to attract and reach like-minded shoppers through a charging ecosystem that fits their daily needs. Ultimately, Volta’s goal is to master the questions of where people go, what they do and how they choose to spend, and to strategically plan its approach to EV charging around the behavior of drivers in a way that delivers value for both the driving community and Volta’s strategic partners.
•Network Development. Volta provides installation, operating and maintenance services, alongside the sale of Volta’s charging products to select site hosts. Volta’s Network Development customers consist of select site hosts that purchase Volta charging stations and receive associated installation and maintenance services, utility companies with whom Volta contracts to perform electrical infrastructure development activities and select site hosts that contract with Volta for the work required to prepare a site for EV infrastructure.
•Charging Network Operations. Volta’s “Charging Network Operations” are tied to the monetization of the electricity delivered to drivers through Volta’s network of charging stations by the sale of regulatory 
Volta Inc. 

credits to third parties. Based on the current regulatory framework, by tracking the delivery of electricity through the use of its charging stations, Volta is able to generate carbon credits that it sells to third parties (see also, “- Government Regulation and Incentives - LCFS Credits” below). In addition, while this revenue stream earned only de minimis revenue in the reporting periods presented, Volta intends to implement pay-for-use charging features in the future and anticipates that Charging Network Operations revenue will include charging fees paid by drivers to purchase electricity through Volta’s charging stations. Currently, other than at a limited number of test locations, drivers do not pay for electricity delivered by Volta’s charging stations, which is provided to drivers on a basis as described above. When Volta begins to charge drivers for use more broadly, Volta intends to determine the price to be paid for electricity by drivers, in its discretion, consistent with applicable law, taking into account, among other things, the market prices of electricity, any applicable regulatory constraints and competitive market rates for EV charging services in the industry.
•Network Intelligence. Volta utilizes its proprietary network planning tool, PredictEV™ to predict charging demand and economic, social and grid impact across its target markets, which it believes enables it to maximize the efficiency and impact of its network and to drive revenue from network partners. This machine learning-driven approach to demand forecasting allows Volta to predict the current and future need for charging services in a given market, facilitating planning of future expansion efforts and sites, strategic partner and driver targeting with the goal of delivering the most electric miles per dollar invested. Volta leverages this data to manage relationships with national and local site hosts and content partners and provide them with additional opportunities to monitor and maximize the value provided by its charging stations and to help support initiatives that respond to network usage, performance and other optimization efforts. Volta believes this tool allows it to effectively and efficiently allocate its capital and strategic partner outreach efforts and to guide the ongoing management of its charging network.
Volta is committed to sustainability, and believes this commitment is aligned with the goals of its business partners and the larger community. For example, it is estimated that drivers using Volta’s charging stations have offset more than 54.3 million pounds of CO2 emissions from July 2014 through December 2021. Volta will continue to evaluate means by which to assess and improve its sustainability profile, though it cannot predict which, if any, such programs it may adopt in the future or at all.
Volta’s Driver Experience
Volta’s aim is to accelerate the EV movement by providing a seamless charging experience, thoughtfully located along the paths of EV drivers’ lives. The user experience is an important focus of Volta’s efforts, and it combines its station lighting, driver interfaces, charge speed, mobile application and driver communications to enhance the charging experience for drivers that use its stations. A key part of this approach is Volta’s development of its stylish, well-located and easy-to-use charging stations, which aim to make the charging process uncomplicated and enjoyable. Volta also facilitates the driver experience through its proprietary mobile application, available for iOS and Android, which provides EV drivers with vital station information, including the ability to locate EV charging stations on the Volta network, view real-time station status information, initiate EV charging sessions, report and troubleshoot any issues and view their charging history. Volta seeks to continuously innovate and expand the functionality of its mobile application and has released new features, such as station check-in and payment processing capabilities, both of which it intends to deploy more broadly across its network and user base in the near future. In addition, in order to make EV charging as seamless as possible, Volta has integrated all Volta branded and site partner owned charging stations into one network that is available to drivers who use the Volta mobile application. Volta is also expanding its product offerings to respond to market demand for DCFC chargers. Volta also intends to partner with OEMs and other mobile application providers to make the Volta mobile application available through EVs, in-dash navigation or other user interface systems, as well as through other mobile charging and map applications, to further simplify the user experience for drivers. Finally, Volta seeks to provide rapid and high-quality driver and equipment support to ensure that host sites can provide uninterrupted charging services and drivers can receive reliable charging for their EVs. Volta’s goal is to make it simple for drivers to find and use Volta’s charging stations, with minimal disruption to their daily routine.

Volta’s Products and Services
Volta provides a broad range of EV-charging-related products and services and content display offerings to its site hosts and strategic business partners. Volta’s business model aims to maximize deployment of capital to deliver compelling value per unit and dollars per mile of capital invested. Volta’s current business model is capable of generating revenue from multiple sources, including Behavior and Commerce, Network Development, Charging Network Operations and Network Intelligence.
•Behavior and Commerce revenue is derived from the sale of advertising to Volta partners that purchase media display time on its content-driven charging stations to conduct their media and advertising campaigns to generate commerce or influence targeted driver behavior. In 2020, Behavior and Commerce represented 41% of Volta’s total revenues and in 2021, it represented 80% of Volta’s total revenues.
•Network Development revenue is generated by providing site development installation, operating and maintenance services, and the sale of Volta’s charging products to select site hosts. Network Development revenue is also generated from contracts with utility companies for the sale of installed electrical infrastructure, which accounted for 7.5% of revenue in 2020 and 0% in 2021, respectively, with the balance of Network Development revenue attributable to Volta’s site partners. Overall, Network Development revenue accounted for 54% in 2020 and 16% of Volta’s total revenues in 2021. Volta’s Network Development customers consist of select site hosts that purchase Volta charging stations and receive associated installation and maintenance services, utility companies with whom Volta contracts to perform electrical infrastructure development activities and select site partners for whom Volta performs the development work required to prepare a site for EV charging infrastructure. Currently, there is immaterial overlap between Volta’s Behavior and Commerce and Network Development customers.
•Charging Network Operations revenue is generated by tracking the delivery of electricity through the use of Volta’s charging stations, which generates LCFS credits that Volta sells to third parties under the regulatory framework currently in effect. In 2020, Charging Network Operations revenue represented 4% of Volta’s total revenues and for 2021, it represented 2% of Volta’s total revenues. Volta intends to implement pay-for-use charging features in the future and anticipates that its “Charging Network Operations” revenue will

EV Charging Products
Volta has designed and deployed a managed network of EV charging stations that function as an integrated content network. Available in differentiated models for varying charging speeds, Volta’s content-driven EV charging stations feature high-resolution 55-inch digital displays. Volta also provides screenless stations to supplement its digital display-equipped EV charging stations and to allow site hosts to scale their EV charging offerings in a manner appropriate to their site. Volta plans to continue to innovate and expand the product and service offerings available with its EV charging stations.
Volta works with a number of different suppliers and vendors with respect to its product offerings and has a suite of products that are capable of matching desired dwell time to charging speed, including both media and non-media enabled DCFC stations and AC stations. DCFC, such as Volta provides or modified versions which Volta may provide in the future, are capable of adding a substantial driving range in as little as 15 minutes, depending on the charging capabilities of the particular EV’s battery and the charging rate of the DCFC station which can be configured to complement the preferred dwell-time at a particular site. Volta’s AC chargers are ideally suited for enabling “top-up” charging along a driver’s daily route or charging at a location where longer dwell time characteristics are desired, allowing a driver to plug in and charge while shopping, working or attending entertainment venues or otherwise going about their lives. Volta’s product offerings will need to stay current with the charging capabilities of the EVs on the road, which over the course of Volta’s operations, have had battery sizes which continue to increase, resulting in longer ranges, and the ability to accept higher rates of charging. This has, in certain locations, increased market demand for DCFC chargers – a trend Volta expects to continue and accelerate in the near future. Volta is responding to these market forces by increasing its DCFC installations at locations with comparatively shorter dwell times. This increased rate of DCFC installations requires additional resources to be dedicated to keeping up with expected demand (including potential demand to replace existing AC charging stations with DCFC stations), which will increase cost and expense, in some cases earlier than previously anticipated due to the rapid increase in EV battery range and charging capability.
Volta deploys its EV charging platform network by either leasing or licensing space at host site locations for the installation of Volta-owned charging stations or by selling charging stations to select site hosts and performing related maintenance services. Volta also generates Behavior and Commerce revenue through the delivery of media partner content across both Volta-owned and site partner-owned charging stations equipped with digital displays.
EV Charging-Related Services
Volta Inc. 

Volta installs its chargers in premium parking spaces owned or leased by commercial or public-entity site hosts that desire to provide EV charging services at their respective locations. Volta’s site hosts include retail centers, grocery stores, pharmacies, movie theaters, parking lots, healthcare/medical facilities, municipalities, sport and entertainment venues, parks and recreation areas, restaurants, schools and universities, certain transit and fueling locations and office buildings and other locations. Under both its master service agreements and negotiated agreements for specific sites, Volta typically targets agreements for the installation of its charging stations at host sites with an initial term of ten years, with the option to extend the lease for up to two five-year terms. Such agreements address both Volta rental payments and access to and payment for electricity at host sites. In addition, Volta has sold EV charging stations to select business partners and site hosts under contractual arrangements pursuant to which Volta performs related installation, operation and maintenance services, while retaining the exclusive right to sell media display time on the media-enabled charging stations for the duration of the contract term, commonly ten years and has contracted with select site partners to perform the development work required to prepare sites for the installation of EV charging infrastructure.
In connection with locating its EV charging stations at its host sites, Volta is responsible for installation, operation and maintenance of the EV charging stations, including delivering electricity to drivers who access its publicly available charging network. Volta obtains electricity from site host locations where its stations are installed and either pays electricity costs to its site hosts based on negotiated rates in its agreements or makes electricity payments directly to the relevant utility company.
Volta currently employs an open-access model which leverages Volta’s Behavior and Commerce (advertising) revenue to provide charging at no cost to shoppers and visitors that use Volta charging stations. Volta is developing a pay-for-use by the driver charging model, where drivers will pay for the electricity they receive at rates to be determined by Volta in the future, in accordance with applicable law, taking into account, among other things, the then-prevailing cost of electricity, any applicable regulatory constraints and competitive market rates in the industry. Volta has begun limited testing for the implementation of pay-for-use by the driver charging features, and anticipates implementing idle fees for remaining connected to a station for more than a certain amount of time after charging is complete. Volta also makes its mobile application available to drivers free of charge, which drivers can use to locate available chargers and initiate EV charging sessions, among other features.
Volta also provides certain site hosts with data to help them better understand charger utilization and driver engagement at their sites, as well as positive environmental impact from the charging services they are facilitating, based on the methodologies discussed above under “Volta’s Solution and Go to Market Strategy.”
Content Services
Volta sells media display time on its media-enabled charging station digital displays to various national and regional businesses and content channel partners who deliver media content on Volta’s charging network to market their products and services, as well as to site hosts who wish to display promotional content on the charging stations located at their sites. Volta charges fees for these services based on the number of impressions delivered in respect of each content and media campaign. Volta believes its EV charging stations provide a new investment thesis for marketers, helping them find real-world growth by leveraging the growing EV market opportunity, while solving for sustainability concerns of regulators and stakeholders, and making it easier to target their customer demographic on their daily routes. Volta can also use its proprietary network planning tool and data collection efforts to demonstrate the value proposition of its charging stations to content partners, using metrics showing superior station utilization and increased retail engagement at its host sites. Volta’s advanced content systems also offer varying types of marketing opportunities and approaches to its content partners, including ad serving, programmatic buying, dynamic media and other ad tech innovations. Volta’s content customers include automotive OEMs, national and regional retail, consumer packaged goods and professional services companies and various channel partners.

Volta intends to leverage its competitive strengths and the following growth strategies to continue to scale its network of EV charging offerings and drive stakeholder value.
•Accelerate new and enhanced product offerings. Volta intends to continue to further develop and expand the product offerings it makes available to its commercial partners, including its EV charging, network tool, digital display and content display offerings.
•Expanding sales and marketing. Volta intends to continue to invest in its sales and marketing efforts to capitalize on the continued growth opportunity in the EV market and enable appropriate and effective engagement with site hosts and content partners across verticals and channels. Volta also intends to develop loyalty programs that can be used to enhance the driver experience. While Volta views this is an important long-term initiative, loyalty programs do not currently contribute to its Behavior and Commerce or other revenues.
•Targeted expansion in existing and new markets. Volta will continue to use its proprietary network planning tools to expand its footprint in existing markets and assess and consider expansion into new markets, both in North America and Europe, in order to continue to attract new site hosts and content partners. Volta also intends to pursue a “land-and-expand” model which encourages existing site hosts to increase their Volta charging station footprint over time as EV penetration increases.
•Research and development. Volta intends to invest considerable time and expense into enhancing its products and services and to continue to provide differentiated EV charging offerings to the market. Volta intends to continue to develop its proprietary network planning tool, PredictEV™, to assist in the evaluation of additional North American and international markets. Volta also plans to continue to develop its mobile application and its interoperability features to allow Volta to partner with additional OEMs and commercial partners.
Volta’s Partnerships and Strategic Relationships
Volta is focused on establishing and maintaining strong long-term relationships with real estate and retail partners and site hosts with national and regional multi-site portfolios of commercial properties to build out its charging network, both in the U.S. and in Europe. Such site hosts can span a wide array of industries and locations and currently include retail centers, grocery stores, pharmacies, movie theaters, parking lots, healthcare/medical facilities, municipalities, sport and entertainment venues, parks and recreation areas, restaurants, schools and universities, certain transit and fueling locations and office buildings and other locations. For Volta’s partners with multi-site portfolios, Volta executes master service agreements with site hosts which help facilitate conversion of prospect sites into developable locations by standardizing terms and conditions for site leasing and access. Volta’s management believes the benefits offered to site hosts by its business model will continue to provide Volta with access to the highest quality property owners and site hosts. Such access and continued premier placement of Volta’s stations will in turn allow it to continue demonstrating the benefits of its content display offerings to its partners, leveraging the expansion of its EV charging network to grow its relationships with key national and regional content partners as the Volta network scales.
The table below is representative of a portion of Volta’s commercial partners since December 31, 2021. The representative commercial partners shown below are not indicative of any particular level of revenue generation and are intended to demonstrate the breadth of potential commercial partners with which Volta has engaged since December 31, 2021. These prominent Volta partners offer brand recognition, industry and national and regional 
Volta Inc. 

multi-site portfolios that may be available for future deployment of Volta charging stations and demonstrate the breadth of the partners that Volta works with and are examples of partners with whom Volta has engaged for a variety of commercial reasons and not simply revenue generation. Commercial partners who buy media and advertising space do so from time-to-time and not under the terms of a long-term agreement, so differentiating between current and past partners may not be indicative of potential revenue streams, but is indicative of the types of commercial partners who are engaging with Volta in the Behavior & Commerce space. For instance, the site partners listed under “Stores” below are representative of the types of top national brands with which Volta has a master service agreement or specific marquee site agreements. The site partners listed under “REITS” below are representative of additional site partners with whom Volta has contractual relationships with and who control important national or regional portfolios of properties that Volta believes would add value to its network. The properties listed under “Community” below represent marquee locations in high value markets. In the “Behavior & Commerce” category below, each of the “OEMs” and “National Brands” listed paid for advertising content on Volta’s media-enabled charging stations and are representative of the type of household names that we believe perceive value in Volta’s advertising network. “Channel Partnerships” are negotiated to extend the reach of Volta’s direct sales efforts for its advertising services. The companies listed under “Utilities and Government” have signed subscriptions for Volta’s PredictEV™ product or are companies with whom Volta has existing relationships and who we believe are potential future subscribers.
Suppliers and Service Providers
Volta has invested in and maintains long-term relationships with suppliers and service providers. Volta designs its EV charging stations in-house with the assistance of professional design consultants and outsources production to contract manufacturers. At this stage of the industry, equipment can be unique to each supplier with respect to components and aftermarket maintenance and warranty services. Volta relies on a limited number of suppliers and manufacturers, and in some cases only a single supplier for some components, for the manufacture and supply of its charging stations. Peerless-AV, which assembles Volta’s charging stations, was Volta’s principal supplier for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, accounting for 80% and 53% of Volta’s supply-related expenditures for such periods, respectively. Furthermore, for the year ended December 31, 2021, Tianjin BYD Auto Co., LTD, a tooling manufacturer, accounted for 10% of Volta's supply-related expenditures. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, no other supplier or manufacturer for the supply or manufacture of Volta’s charging stations accounted for greater than approximately 10% of Volta’s supply-related expenditures for the applicable period. See also “Information About Volta — COVID-19 Impact.”
Volta Inc. 

Volta’s and Peerless-AV’s supply relationship is governed by a Supply Agreement under which Volta has the right to place orders for the purchase of charging stations and related equipment (the “Peerless Supply Agreement”). The materials purchased from Peerless pursuant to any purchase order are covered by terms within the Peerless Supply Agreement customary for these types of arrangements, including customary warranty, delivery, payment and liability provisions. The Peerless Supply Agreement requires Volta to purchase at least 60 and no more than 200 charging stations a quarter unless otherwise agreed by Volta and Peerless. The Peerless Supply Agreement may be terminated by either party by notice given at least thirty days before its annual renewal date, by Peerless on six months’ notice, and at any time by the giving of not less than 30-days’ notice upon breach by a party (subject to customary cure rights), except that termination of the Peerless Supply Agreement will not terminate any then-existing purchase order (other than due to breach by the applicable party, subject to customary cure rights). The Peerless Supply Agreement does not require Volta to deal exclusively with Peerless.
In addition, Volta is typically responsible for the installation of its charging stations at its partners’ sites. These installations are generally performed by electrical and civil contractors, consistent and in accordance with accepted industry practices. Those electrical and civil contractors are engaged and managed by Volta under the oversight of Volta’s construction project managers. To facilitate its installation and maintenance activities, Volta has formed relationships with construction and maintenance companies that have significant experience building and maintaining EV charging sites.
Competition
EV Charging
The EV charging market is relatively new and is increasingly competitive with many newcomers. Volta currently faces competition from a number of companies. Volta believes its current competitors to its EV charging owner-operator business activities include EVgo Services LLC (“EVgo”), Electrify America LLC (“Electrify America”), Allego N.V. (“Allego”), Tesla Inc. (“Tesla”), and Rivian Automotive Inc. (“Rivian”). There are also many other large and small EV charging companies that offer non-networked or “basic” chargers that have limited customer leverage but could provide a low-cost solution for basic charger needs in commercial and retail locations, such as Pod Point Limited (“Pod Point”), EVConnect, Inc. (“EVConnect”), Power Dot SA (“Powerdot”), SemaConnect, Inc. (“Semacharge”), and Engie SA (“Engie”), as well EV charging equipment manufacturers that also compete with Volta, like ChargePoint, Inc. (“Chargepoint”), EVBox Group (“EVBox”), FLO Services USA Inc. ("Flo"), Revel Transit Inc. ("Revel"), and Blink Charging Co. (“Blink”), in addition to charging networks being developed by OEMs, such as IONITY GmbH (“Ionity”), and utilities, such as EDF Group (“EDF”), or in partnership with any of the aforementioned competitors. 
The principal competitive factors in the EV charging industry include the number of stations in a network; capital deployment efficacy; number of revenue lines and diversity of revenue opportunities, charger utilization and pricing to drivers; charger connectivity to EVs and ability to charge all models and standards; charger network reliability, scale and local density; charger locations and accessibility; speed of charging relative to expected vehicle dwell times at the location; software-enabled service offerings and overall business partner and driver user experience; operator brand, track record and reputation; access to equipment vendors and service providers; installation expertise and costs; brand recognition and reputation; mobile application interface and ease of use; partnerships with OEMs; and policy incentives. Large initial stage markets require significant early capital expenditures, engagement across verticals and driver engagement to gain market share and a continued effort to scale product and service offerings, channels, installers, teams and processes. There are also competitors who may have limited funding, experience or commitment to quality assurance, which could cause poor experiences, hampering overall EV adoption or trust in any particular provider of charging services. Volta believes these additional competitors may struggle with gaining the necessary network traction but could gain momentum in the future. Further, Volta’s current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with different commercial objectives and imperatives and greater available resources.
Volta believes it has a competitive advantage in delivering charging services driven by its differentiated business model, EV charging station design, charging station placement, network tools and the additional value Volta’s charging stations can deliver to its site hosts and business partners by combining content display offerings with charging services to drive higher utilization as compared to Volta’s competitors.
Content
Volta Inc. 

The place-based digital media industry is fragmented, consisting of a few traditional companies operating on a national and international basis, such as Outfront Media, Inc., Amscreen, Clear Channel Outdoor, Lamar, JCDecaux, Intersection and GSTV, as well as newer, digitally-forward, omni-channel platforms like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and hundreds of smaller regional and local companies operating a limited number of displays in a single or a few local geographic markets. Volta competes with all of these companies for its content customers. Volta also competes with other content, including broadcast and cable television, radio, print media, internet and mobile and direct mail marketers, within their respective markets. In addition, Volta competes with a wide variety of out-of-home media, including media in shopping centers, grocery stores, movie theaters, transit locations and sports and entertainment venues. Advertisers compare relative costs of available media, cost per thousand impressions of a piece of content, as well as markets, locations and audiences, particularly when delivering a message to customers with distinct demographic characteristics. In competing with other content, Volta intends to rely on its differentiated product and its content-driven charging station placement which can provide access to a high-value audience, historically unavailable locations, an uncluttered media experience, the opportunity to influence purchase and brand decisions immediately prior to site visitors entering a retail environment, a compelling halo effect for brands desiring alignment with sustainability and the growing ability to prove efficacy of digital content in the real world.
Governmental Regulation and Incentives
Government regulations for installation and operation of EV charging stations and place-based media content vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may include, but are not limited to, permitting and sign code requirements, inspection requirements, licensing of contractors, certifications, environmental requirements, health and safety requirements and restrictions around digital display placement and content.
Compliance with such regulations is an important aspect of Volta’s ability to continue its operations and avoid additional costs and installation delays for its EV charging stations. The descriptions that follow are summaries and should be read in conjunction with the texts of the regulations described herein, which are subject to change. The descriptions do not purport to describe all present and proposed regulations affecting Volta’s business. Volta is not currently materially dependent on any government programs supporting EV technology.
Grants and Incentives
Volta continuously pursues public grants, subsidies and incentives to reduce its capital expenditures. Volta has dedicated, and plans to further dedicate, a variety of internal and external resources to monitor, apply for and utilize available grant, subsidy and incentive funding for the development of charging infrastructure on a state, local, national and international level. Volta may inform its network expansion and local build plans based on expected timing for and availability of funding of this type. Volta has received grants from a number of third parties.
Volta intends to continue to seek additional grants, rebates, subsidies and incentives as an effective avenue to reduce its capital investment in the promotion, purchase and installation of charging stations where applicable.
Government Regulations to Enhance EV Adoption
Some governments provide incentives to end users and purchasers of EVs and EV charging stations in the form of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives, such as payments for regulatory credits, as discussed in more detail below. The EV market relies on these governmental rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives to significantly lower the effective costs associated with EVs and EV charging stations.
For example, in the U.S., the regulations mandated by the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (“CAFE”) standards set the average new vehicle fuel economy, as weighted by sales, that a manufacturer’s fleet must achieve. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has established vehicle carbon dioxide emissions standards through model year 2026 for light-duty vehicles; however, the Biden Administration has announced plans to reconsider these standards and the EPA has restored California’s authority to establish its own more stringent standards, which several other states have elected to follow. Although Volta is not a car manufacturer, and thus not directly subject to the CAFE standards, such standards may still indirectly affect Volta’s business. The adoption of more stringent standards may create further incentives for vehicle manufacturers to increase their EV offerings, which would likely result in increased demand for charging services. Additionally, several states, such as California, 
Volta Inc. 

Massachusetts and New York, have adopted or are considering adopting bans on the sale of internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035 and a number of European countries, including France, Norway and the United Kingdom, have adopted or are considering adopting bans on the sale of new internal combustion engine vehicles between 2025 and 2040.
Regulatory Credits
Volta earns various tradable regulatory credits, in particular California’s LCFS credits, as well as carbon credits under comparable LCFS programs in other states. Volta earns credits for the kilowatt-hours distributed by its stations and, in certain cases, the installation of DCFC infrastructure under California’s Fast Charging Infrastructure program. Volta earns revenue from the sale of these credits, and expects to continue to sell future credits, to entities that generate deficits under the LCFS programs and are obligated to purchase the credits and use them to offset their deficits or emissions, primarily petroleum refiners and marketers, and other entities that can use the credits to comply with the program requirements, or through exchanges. Volta actively seeks to maximize the number of regulatory credits generated per kWh of energy dispensed. Volta’s management is actively monitoring proposed and newly enacted LCFS programs in other jurisdictions (including, for example, states, such as Massachusetts, New York, Colorado and Washington) as potential future revenue streams. The availability of such credits depends on continued governmental support for these programs and regulatory frameworks that make it possible for Volta to participate in these credit markets. There is no guarantee that such credits will continue to be available for sale or that regulatory restrictions would not be imposed on the proceeds from the sale of such credits in the future. Additionally, to the extent government incentives result in increased build-out of electric or other low-carbon fuel dispensing infrastructure that also produce LCFS or similar regulatory credits, the revenue received from the sale of such credits may diminish.
Other EV Charging Regulations
On December 16, 2019, California adopted amendments to the state’s electric vehicle supply equipment specifications that prohibit, or will prohibit, public-charging operators from billing customers by the minute within the state. The prohibition on per-minute billing currently applies to all new AC chargers installed or replaced on or after January 1, 2021 and will apply to new DCFCs installed or replaced on or after January 1, 2023. Chargers installed before 2021 can continue time-based billing until 2031 for AC chargers and 2033 for DCFCs.
California, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia, Washington and the District of Columbia have determined that companies that sell EV charging services to the public will not be regulated as utilities. While these individual state determinations are not binding on any other regulator or jurisdiction, they demonstrate a trend in the way states view the nascent EV charging industry. Other jurisdictions are in the process of adopting such reforms.
Manufacturing and Safety Regulations
Volta does not directly manufacture or assemble its charging stations; however, Volta may still be subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended (“OSHA”) in the United States and occupational health and safety regulations in Europe. OSHA establishes certain employer responsibilities, including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury, compliance with standards promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and various record keeping, disclosure and procedural requirements. Various standards, including standards for notices of hazards, safety in excavation and demolition work and the handling of asbestos, may apply to Volta’s operations. 
In addition, in the U.S., the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (“NEMA”) is the association of electrical equipment and medical imaging manufacturers. NEMA provides a forum for the development of technical standards that are in the best interests of the industry and users, advocacy of industry policies on legislative and regulatory matters, and collection, analysis, and dissemination of industry data.
Several states, including California, have adopted variations of the national guidelines governing electric vehicle fueling systems set forth in the National Institute of Standards and Technology Handbook 44, which provide safety, pricing, labeling, testing, certification, and other requirements for electric vehicle charging stations that charge fees to users for the delivery of electricity. As Volta introduces charging fees for the receipt of electricity from its 
Volta Inc. 

stations, the regulatory burden will likely increase and Volta will likely need to expend additional resources to meet such increased regulatory burden. A failure of Volta to timely meet regulatory requirements in its design or implementation of stations or in implementing updates to its stations that are already installed in order to meet these regulatory requirements could delay Volta’s ability to implement fees for users and have a material impact on its business.
Waste Handling and Disposal
Volta is subject to environmental laws and regulations regarding the handling and disposal of hazardous substances and solid wastes, including electronic wastes and batteries. These laws regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and may impose strict, joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. For instance, the U.S.’s Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release of the hazardous substance occurred as well as companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and seek to recover costs incurred from the responsible classes of persons. In the course of ordinary operations, Volta, through third parties and contractors, may handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA and similar state statutes and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites as which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment.
Volta may also be subject to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) in the U.S. and comparable state statutes for the generation or disposal of solid wastes, which may include hazardous wastes. RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, but in particular, imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. Provided that certain requirements are met, certain components of our charging stations may be excluded from RCRA’s hazardous waste regulations; however, if these components do not meet all established requirements for the exclusion to apply, or if the requirements for the exclusion change, Volta may be required to treat such products as hazardous waste which are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. Any changes in the laws or regulations, or any changes in Volta’s ability to qualify the materials used for exclusions under such laws and regulations, could adversely affect Volta’s operating expenses.
In Europe, Volta may be subject to additional environmental regulations. 
Place-Based Media Industry Regulations
The place-based media and outdoor media industry is subject to governmental regulation and enforcement at all levels of government in the United States and Europe. These regulations have a significant impact on the outdoor media industry and may have an impact on Volta’s content sales activities.
In particular, construction, repair, maintenance, lighting, upgrading, height, size, spacing, the location and permitting of outdoor digital displays and the use of new technologies for changeable displays, such as digital displays, are regulated by governments, and, from time to time, governments have prohibited or significantly limited the construction of new outdoor media displays or structures. Since digital displays have been developed and introduced relatively recently into the market on a large scale, existing regulations that currently do not apply to them by their terms could be revised or new regulations could be enacted to impose greater restrictions on digital displays due to alleged concerns over aesthetics or driver safety.
In recent years, outdoor media also has become the subject of other targeted taxes and fees and, from time to time, legislation has been introduced attempting to impose taxes on revenue from outdoor media or for the right to use outdoor media assets. In particular, a number of U.S. governments have implemented or initiated taxes, fees and registration requirements in an effort to decrease or restrict the number of outdoor signs and/or to raise revenue. Several U.S. jurisdictions have imposed such taxes as a percentage of outdoor media revenue generated in that 
Volta Inc. 

jurisdiction or based on the size and type of display technology. These laws may affect prevailing competitive conditions in specified markets in a variety of ways. Such laws may reduce Volta’s expansion opportunities or may increase or reduce competitive pressure from other members of the outdoor media industry.
In addition, restrictions on the use of outdoor media to display certain products, services or other content have been imposed by laws and regulations. For example, in the U.S. and Germany, tobacco products have been effectively banned from outdoor media in most jurisdictions and state and local governments in some cases limit outdoor advertising of alcohol. Further, certain municipalities may limit issue-based outdoor advertising or place restrictions on advertising off-site or off-premises products or services. Additional restrictions on outdoor media of certain products and services are or may be imposed by laws and regulations.
Intellectual Property
Volta protects its intellectual property and proprietary rights through patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and unfair competition laws, augmented by its own confidentiality protocols. Volta undertakes actions as necessary to ensure that its proprietary rights are protected while at the same time respecting the intellectual property rights of other persons.
As of December 31, 2021, Volta had ten issued design patents and seven pending design patent applications 
in addition to two issued utility patents and 31 pending provisional and utility patent applications in the United States. Internationally, as of December 31, 2021, Volta had 70 issued design patents and 21 pending design patent applications, in addition to two issued utility patents issued and seven pending utility patent applications. Volta continues to regularly assess opportunities for seeking patent protection for those aspects of its technology, designs and methodologies that it believes provide a meaningful competitive advantage.
Human Capital Resources 
We have always prioritized the importance of our workforce as a critical stakeholder and a core part of our competitive advantage. We hire with values-based principles that encompasses competency, ingenuity, and culture. Through multiple growth phases, we have drawn talent and leadership from the automotive, electric vehicle, consumer electronics and other technology industries to achieve our vision. As of December 31, 2021, Volta had 324 regular full-time employees in the U.S., nine regular full-time employees in Canada and twenty regular full-time employees in Europe. None of Volta’s U.S. employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Volta has never experienced a work stoppage. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stakeholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
Facilities
Volta was incorporated on July 24, 2020, as a Cayman Islands exempted company under the name Tortoise Acquisition Corp. II (“Tortoise Corp II”), which was a special purpose acquisition company. On September 15, 2020, Tortoise Corp II completed its initial public offering. On August 26, 2021, Tortoise Corp II consummated a reverse recapitalization with Volta Industries, Inc., (the “Reverse Recapitalization”), and, as contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of February 7, 2021 (the “Business Combination Agreement”), re-domesticated as a Delaware corporation and changed its name to Volta Inc. Our website address is www.voltacharging.com. Volta’s primary office is located at 155 De Haro St., San Francisco, California 94103, where Volta's building space totaling approximately 8,480 rentable square feet under a lease that, as currently amended, expires in August 2025. Volta uses these facilities for office space and warehouse purposes. Volta also maintains facilities in New York, New York; Montreal, Canada; Berlin, Germany; and Paris, France; as well as an additional warehouse office space in San Francisco, CA. Volta believes its existing facilities are adequate for its current requirements.
Legal Proceedings
Volta Inc. 

From time to time, Volta may become involved in actions, claims, suits and other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of its business, including assertions by third parties relating to intellectual property infringement, breaches of contract or warranties, shareholder or securities litigation, or employment-related matters. On March 30, 2022, a putative class action complaint was filed against the Company and two of the Company’s officers (collectively, the “Defendants”) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The lawsuit alleges that Defendants violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, by making materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations and prospects. Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of persons or entities that purchased Volta securities between August 2, 2021 and March 28, 2022. The complaint seeks unspecified damages, attorneys’ fees, and other costs. To the Company’s knowledge the Defendants have not yet been served. While the Company believes that the claims are without merit and it intends to vigorously defend against them, any litigation is inherently uncertain, and any judgment or injunctive relief entered against the Company or any adverse settlement could materially and adversely impact its business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.
