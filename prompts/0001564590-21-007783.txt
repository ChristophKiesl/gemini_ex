Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company using our expertise in epigenetics to discover and develop novel therapeutics that address serious unmet medical needs in patients with cancers associated with abnormal gene expression or drug resistance. Our integrated epigenetics platform enables us to validate targets and generate small molecules impacting these targets to selectively modulate gene expression in tumor and immune cells to drive anti-tumor activity. This platform reflects our deep understanding of the biology of regulation of gene expression by epigenetic regulatory proteins, or epigenetic regulators, the development of small-molecule product candidates that selectively modulate their activity, and the design of clinical development programs supported by novel biomarker strategies. We are able to target a broad variety of epigenetic regulators using our platform and have generated development candidates acting against distinct classes of those regulators. Our vision is to become a fully integrated pharmaceutical company, with a broad pipeline of hematology and oncology development and discovery programs as well as commercial products in the future.
 We have utilized our epigenetics platform to discover and design our wholly owned product candidates, pelabresib (CPI-0610) and CPI-0209. We continue to leverage this platform and our clinical experience to develop these product candidates and to discover and develop additional product candidates. Pelabresib inhibits the function of bromodomain and extra terminal domain, or BET, proteins. CPI-0209 inhibits the enzymatic function of zeste homolog 2, or EZH2, protein. In addition to our product candidates, we are also exploring CPI-482, which inhibits the function of the lysine-specific demethylase 1, or LSD1 (aka KDM1A) protein. We believe that our approach to targeting these central gene regulatory mechanisms associated with cancer proliferation may enable us to provide therapeutic benefits to cancer patients. We are currently conducting clinical trials of these product candidates.
 Our most advanced clinical trial is MANIFEST-2, a global, double-blinded, randomized pivotal Phase 3 clinical study of pelabresib in combination with ruxolitinib (marketed as Jakafi®/Jakavi®) versus placebo with ruxolitinib in Janus-kinase-1/2 (“JAK”)- inhibitor-naïve patients with myelofibrosis (“MF”). We decided to proceed with this trial based on the preliminary evidence of clinical activity in patients with MF treated with pelabresib in combination with ruxolitinib in MANIFEST, our ongoing open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of pelabresib as a monotherapy and in combination with ruxolitinib. We believe that preliminary data from MANIFEST suggest that pelabresib has the potential to offer meaningful benefits beyond the current standard of care in MF. For additional information on our pelabresib trials, see the section below titled Our Product Candidates/Pelabresib—BET Inhibitor/Clinical Development.
 In addition, we are currently conducting the Phase 1 portion of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of CPI-0209, our second-generation EZH2 inhibitor. For more information on our CPI-0209 trial, see section below titled Our Product Candidates/CPI-0209 – Second Generation EZH2 Inhibitor.    
 Pelabresib 
 Pelabresib is a small molecule designed to promote anti-tumor activity by specifically inhibiting the function of BET proteins, which normally enhance target gene expression. The FDA granted orphan drug designation to pelabresib for the treatment of MF in November 2019. 
 We believe there is a significant opportunity to improve treatment of MF patients. Ruxolitinib and fedratinib (marketed as Inrebic®) are the two approved drug therapies for MF in the United States, and ruxolitinib is the worldwide standard of care for the disease. In clinical trials, ruxolitinib has been shown to reduce spleen volume and improve patient-reported symptoms in a minority of patients. However, ruxolitinib has been associated with worsening hematological parameters, including thrombocytopenia, anemia, and transfusion dependence. The product also has demonstrated a limited ability to improve bone marrow fibrosis, which has been documented as a primary cause of morbidity and mortality in MF. Some patients cannot start treatment with ruxolitinib, in some cases because of low platelet levels, low hemoglobin levels, or RBC transfusion dependence. Other patients treated with ruxolitinib do not achieve targeted clinical outcomes, such as a 35% or greater reduction in spleen volume or a 50% improvement in symptom scores. Approximately three-quarters of patients in clinical trials discontinued use of ruxolitinib within five years, in part due to side effects or relapse / recurrence of their disease.    
 In our MANIFEST trial, we enrolled MF patients who are JAK-inhibitor-naïve, a first-line, or 1L, setting, and continue to enroll patients who are refractory to or intolerant of, or have had a sub-optimal response to, ruxolitinib, a second-line, or 2L, setting. In the 1L setting, we are testing pelabresib in combination with ruxolitinib in JAK-inhibitor-naïve patients with the aim of measuring spleen volume reduction and symptom improvement, among other relevant parameters. In the 2L setting, we are stratifying patients for dependence on red-blood-cell, or RBC, transfusions. In transfusion-dependent, or TD, patients,

we are measuring conversion to transfusion independence, or TI, in addition to spleen volume reduction and symptom improvement. In non-TD patients, we are measuring spleen volume reduction and symptom improvement, among other parameters.
 At the American Society of Hematology, or ASH, annual meeting in December 2020, we presented preliminary clinical and translational data based on a September 29, 2020 data cutoff date that showed signs of activity for pelabresib across a broad range of parameters as both a first-line and second-line treatment for patients with MF.  Specifically, we have observed preliminary evidence of activity of pelabresib as a monotherapy and in combination with ruxolitinib across a range of parameters in MF, including reduction in spleen volume as measured by magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI; improvements in patient-reported symptoms; improvements in anemia and conversion from transfusion dependence to transfusion independence; and improvements in bone marrow fibrosis. and red blood cell precursors. While these preliminary data need to be confirmed in a larger dataset, we believe that these data suggest that pelabresib may have disease-modifying effects. As of September 29, 2020, pelabresib, both as monotherapy and in combination with ruxolitinib, was generally well-tolerated in each arm of the MANIFEST trial.  See the section below titled Our Product Candidates/Pelabresib—BET Inhibitor/Clinical Development for more information. 
 Based on the preliminary evidence from our MANIFEST trial, we are currently conducting MANIFEST-2 in combination with ruxolitinib in JAK-inhibitor-naïve patients with MF who have splenomegaly and symptoms requiring therapy.
 CPI-0209
 CPI-0209 is a small molecule designed to promote anti-tumor activity by specifically inhibiting EZH2, an enzyme that suppresses target gene expression. We believe that targeting EZH2 has the potential for broad therapeutic application in a variety of tumor types. Based on preclinical data, we believe that CPI-0209, our second-generation and potentially best-in-class EZH2 inhibitor, may enable us to address additional patient populations beyond those that have been targeted by first-generation EZH2 inhibitors such as our earlier program CPI-1205, which we discontinued further development of in 2020. Based on this belief, we designed CPI-0209 to achieve comprehensive coverage of EZH2. We have seen evidence of preclinical activity of CPI-0209 both as a single agent and in combination with other agents. We believe this compound has potentially broad application in several solid tumors and hematological malignancies. We initiated a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial with CPI-0209 in September 2019, which is the Phase 1 portion of our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of CPI-0209and is designed to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose for CPI-0209.  See section below titled Our Product Candidates/CPI-0209 – Second Generation EZH2 Inhibitor for more information.

LSD1 Inhibitor - CPI-482
 CPI-482 is an inhibitor of Lysine Specific Demethylase 1 (LSD1), a critical regulator of gene expression, required for hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and proper differentiation of megakaryocyte and erythroid lineages.  In myelofibrosis, aberrant megakaryocyte biology is responsible for elevated inflammatory cytokine production and bone marrow dysfunction. Inhibition of LSD1 by CPI-482 suppressed megakaryocyte formation in ex vivo differentiation experiments and reduced spleen volume and bone marrow fibrosis and improved survival in myelofibrosis and leukemia mouse models. We are exploring the potential of CPI-482 as a potential clinical candidate and therapeutic option in hematologic malignancies, including in myeloproliferative neoplasms (“MPNs”) and plan to complete IND enabling studies by the end of 2021.

Cancer and Epigenetics 
 Cancer is a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell division and growth. Cancer can arise when the dysregulation of the affected cell’s gene expression program alters the identity and function of normal cells. This dysregulation can arise when there are changes in genes that control cell identity. Cancer cells can utilize modulation of gene expression in part by using epigenetic regulators to activate pro-tumor genes or deactivate tumor suppressor genes. Furthermore, cancer cells can also use epigenetic regulators to activate resistance mechanisms against cancer treatments, including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, and render the treatments less effective. 
 Epigenetics refers to a broad regulatory system that controls gene expression by modifying chromatin, which consists of DNA wrapped around an assembly of proteins called histones. The DNA included in chromatin is identical in each cell in the body. The identity and function of each cell is determined by the specific set of genes that are expressed, or turned on or off, in a given cell. Whether a specific set of genes is turned on or off depends on the action of epigenetic regulators.
 Our Approach 
 We are a pioneer in the discovery and development of novel therapeutics that target various classes of epigenetic regulators and modulate gene expression in a more selective manner than early epigenetic drugs. Our efforts have demonstrated that these distinct classes of epigenetic regulators are broadly druggable and that selective reprogramming of gene expression is a promising therapeutic approach not only to induce cancer cell killing but also to enhance anti-tumor immunity. 
Integrated Platform 
 Our integrated epigenetics platform includes a deep understanding of the biological context in which epigenetic regulators operate, the development of small-molecule product candidates that selectively modulate their activity, and the design of clinical development programs supported by novel biomarker strategies. 
 Our approach to therapeutic agents to date has been focused on epigenetic targets: 
  
• | whose inhibition modulates gene expression in a highly selective manner;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | with broad development opportunities, including biomarker-defined contexts, which we believe may expand the applicability of our product candidates to cancers with immune evasion or acquired drug resistance; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | whose inhibition may reprogram immune-suppressive immune cells in the tumor microenvironment to enhance anti-tumor activity.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our epigenetics platform allows us to identify potential product candidates that intervene in diseases by targeting distinct classes of epigenetic regulators, including the following examples: 
  
• | BET proteins—a group of epigenetic readers—are proteins that bind to chromatin and enhance target gene expression. Certain cancer cells can use BET proteins to promote growth of cancer cells and inflammatory disorders;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | EZH2—an epigenetic writer—is an enzyme that suppresses target gene expression by adding modifications to chromatin. Certain cancer and immune cells can use EZH2 to promote growth of cancer cells or suppress an anti-tumor immune responses; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | LSD1 – an epigenetic eraser- is an enzyme that suppresses target gene expression by removing modifications to chromatin. Leukemia stem cell maintenance requires LSD1 function and certain hematological cancer and solid tumor cells require LSD1 function to sustain growth.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We are also currently advancing several discovery programs against undisclosed epigenetic regulators focused on the tumor microenvironment and the immune microenvironment. 
 Our Product Candidates 
 Pelabresib (CPI-0610)—BET Inhibitor 
 Overview 
 BET proteins are epigenetic readers that turn on specific genes by binding unique regions of the genome through their ability to read specific chemical tags on chromatin. In some instances, BET proteins turn on genes that are abnormally expressed in a variety of human cancers. BET inhibitors downregulate the expression of oncogenes, which are key genes that have the potential to cause cancer, such as MYC or NF-κB target genes, and effectively kill many cancer cell lines in in vitro models. 
 4


These observations resulted in the generation and clinical investigation of BET inhibitors in several cancer subtypes. We have observed preclinical activity in cancer subtypes that are driven by NF-κB signaling. 
 Pelabresib is a small molecule designed to promote anti-tumor activity by specifically inhibiting the bromodomain function of BET proteins, which normally enhance target gene expression. Our epigenetics platform reflects our deep understanding of the biological contexts in which BET proteins operate, including cancer pathways that are highly sensitive to pelabresib. A combination of our preclinical studies, as well as translational insights from our first-in-human study of pelabresib, led us to prioritize the clinical development of pelabresib in MF. 
 We are currently conducting two clinical trials of pelabresib in patients with MF. We recently initiated MANIFEST-2, a global, double-blinded, randomized, pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of pelabresib in combination with ruxolitinib (marketed as Jakafi®/Jakavi®) versus placebo with ruxolitinib in patients with MF. Additionally, we are continuing to enroll patients in the second line arms of MANIFEST, our ongoing open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of pelabresib both as a monotherapy and in combination with ruxolitinib in patients with MF.  See the section below titled Our Product Candidates/Pelabresib—BET Inhibitor/Clinical Development for more information.  
 BET Inhibition in Cancer 
 Abnormal BET function has been implicated in cancer through several means, including chromosomal translocation and gene amplification and overexpression whereby oncogenic and inflammatory signals are turned on in cancer cells through altered BET activity. 
 Of note, BET proteins control the expression of the target genes of NF-κB, a key immune signaling pathway that is abnormally activated in various diseases, including cancer and immune disorders. NF-κB signaling has been shown to be abnormally high in some hematological malignancies, such as MF and activated B cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or ABC-DLBCL. In preclinical studies in MF, animals treated with BET inhibitors alone or in combination with a JAK inhibitor displayed a reduction in NF-κB target gene expression, improvement in bone marrow fibrosis, and reduced disease burden. 
 In addition, BET proteins promote the generation of megakaryocytes from hematopoietic stem cells. We believe that the blood cells most responsible for bone marrow scarring in MF are dysfunctional megakaryocytes, which proliferate and produce inflammatory molecules in part through elevated NF-κB signaling.  Additionally, compromised erythroid differentiation (or the process by which immature bone marrow derived cells specialize and become red blood cells) leads to anemia in MF patients. By blocking BET protein function with pelabresib, we believe that we promote erythroid cell differentiation which may result in improved hemoglobin levels and ameliorate anemia in patients with MF. As the result of the effect on both erythroid and megakaryocyte differentiation, we believe that pelabresib has the potential to improve the health of the bone marrow of MF patients.
 Myelofibrosis 
 MF is part of a collection of progressive blood cancers known as myeloproliferative neoplasms and is associated with significantly reduced quality of life and shortened survival. MF can occur either as primary MF, which develops on its own, or as secondary MF, which develops in some patients as a result of essential thrombocythemia, or ET, or polycythemia vera, or PV, resulting in post-ET MF or post-PV MF.  As the disease progresses, the bone marrow produces fewer red blood cells, often leading to severe anemia (a condition characterized by low red-blood-cell counts) and red-blood-cell transfusion requirements. In addition, within one year of diagnosis, the incidence of thrombocytopenia increases significantly. Thrombocytopenia is a condition characterized by low platelet counts in the blood. Among other complications, most patients with MF have enlarged spleens as well as many other physical symptoms, including abdominal discomfort, bone pain, and extreme fatigue. 
 There are limited treatment options for patients with MF. Currently the JAK inhibitors ruxolitinib and fedratinib are the only approved products for MF, and there are no approved products for patients whose MF progresses after treatment with these products. Ruxolitinib is the current standard of care in intermediate- to high-risk MF. Ruxolitinib inhibits dysregulated janus kinase 1 and 2 (collectively referred to herein as “JAK”), signaling that is associated with MF. Ruxolitinib produces spleen reduction and symptom improvement in MF patients. However, its side effects include increased anemia and transfusion dependence. In the SIMPLIFY-1 clinical trial of ruxolitinib in JAK-inhibitor-naïve patients, transfusion dependence increased from 24.0% to 40.1% after 24 weeks of treatment with ruxolitinib. Ruxolitinib has not been shown to significantly reverse bone marrow fibrosis, a condition that has been documented as a primary cause of morbidity and mortality in MF. As a result of these factors, many patients cannot, or choose not to, initiate ruxolitinib therapy. Many other patients may not tolerate treatment with, or will have an insufficient response to, ruxolitinib. Patients generally have poor prospects for survival following discontinuation of therapy with ruxolitinib. 
 5


We believe there are approximately 30,000 to 35,000 intermediate- or high-risk MF patients in the United Stated and Europe that are therefore eligible for systemic treatment, including ruxolitinib. Incyte Corporation, or Incyte, which markets ruxolitinib, has estimated that about half of these eligible patients in the United States receive treatment with ruxolitinib, which is the standard of care. Based on preliminary data from the MANIFEST trial, we aim to demonstrate that virtually all patients eligible for, or taking, ruxolitinib could benefit from taking the combination of pelabresib and ruxolitinib. We aim to show that pelabresib in combination with ruxolitinib is associated with increased spleen volume reduction and symptom improvement compared to ruxolitinib alone. In addition, some MF patients, such as anemic patients, who might delay taking ruxolitinib due to anemia associated with the disease or with ruxolitinib therapy may benefit from initiating on the pelabresib/ruxolitinib combination due to preliminary evidence of hemoglobin improvement and conversion to transfusion independence. Pelabresib monotherapy may also provide benefit for patients who have discontinued treatment with ruxolitinib due to side effects or MF progression. 
 Clinical Development 
 Phase 3 Clinical Trial. We have initiated MANIFEST-2, a global, blinded, randomized Phase 3 clinical trial with pelabresib in combination with ruxolitinib (marketed as Jakafi®/Jakavi®) versus placebo with ruxolitinib in JAK-inhibitor-naïve patients with primary MF or post-ET MF or post-PV MF who have splenomegaly and symptoms requiring therapy. We plan to enroll approximately 310 JAK-inhibitor-naïve patients. Patients are randomized 1:1 to the pelabresib with ruxolitinib arm or the placebo with ruxolitinib arm. Patients in the active arm are treated in a 21-day dosing cycle with 14 days on treatment and seven days off treatment and are administered pelabresib starting at 125 mg once per day, which may be later titrated up to 175 mg once per day provided protocol-defined criteria are met; in the control arm the patients are treated with a placebo administered on the same schedule. Patients in both the active and control arms receive a starting dose of either 10 mg or 15 mg twice per day of ruxolitinib, depending on the platelet count at baseline, with a mandatory up-titration, if safety criteria are met, to 15 or 20 mg twice per day respectively (ruxolitinib label dose) after 1 cycle of therapy.  Subsequent ruxolitinib dose modifications follow the ruxolitinib label.
 The primary endpoint of the trial is the proportion of patients who achieve a ≥35% reduction in spleen volume from baseline, or SVR35, after 24 weeks of treatment. A key secondary endpoint of the trial is the proportion of patients who achieve a 50% or greater improvement in Total Symptom Score from baseline, or TSS50, after 24 weeks of treatment. Based on prior discussions with the FDA, we believe we need to meet both of these endpoints. Other endpoints include bone marrow fibrosis grade improvements, duration of transfusion independence, rate of red-blood-cell transfusion for the first 24 weeks, and hemoglobin response.
 
Phase 2 Clinical Trial. We are continuing to conduct MANIFEST, a Phase 2 clinical trial of pelabresib as a monotherapy and in combination with ruxolitinib in patients with MF. In this trial, we are treating patients who are JAK inhibitor-naïve, a first-line (“1L”) setting, as well as patients who are refractory to or intolerant of, or have had a sub-optimal response to, ruxolitinib, a second-line (“2L”) setting.  Preliminary data based on a September 29, 2020 data cut off showed signs of clinical activity across a broad range of parameters, suggesting possible disease-modifying effects of pelabresib. Additionally, the preliminary data indicated evidence of hemoglobin improvement with pelabresib, which we believe may provide a benefit to patients with anemia, a condition that is associated with both MF itself and treatment with ruxolitinib.
 In the 1L setting (Arm 3), we are testing pelabresib in combination with ruxolitinib in JAK-inhibitor-naïve patients. The primary endpoint in the 1L setting is the proportion of patients who achieve at least SVR35 after 24 weeks of treatment. Patient enrollment in the Arm 3 has completed at approximately 80 patients. We continue to enroll patients in the 2L arms of MANIFEST (Arms 1 and 2). In the 2L setting, we are stratifying patients for dependence on red-blood-cell, or RBC, transfusions. In transfusion-dependent, or TD, patients, the primary endpoint is the proportion of patients who are TD, at baseline who convert to transfusion independence, or TI. TD, based on Gale criteria, is defined to mean two or more units of RBC transfusions per month during the 12 weeks prior to enrollment. TI is defined to mean an absence of RBC transfusions over any consecutive 12-week period following enrollment. For non-TD patients in the 2L setting, the primary endpoint is the 
 6


proportion of patients who achieve SVR35. In each setting, we are also measuring improvements in Total Symptom Score, or TSS, as measured by the Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment form, version 4.0, which is a patient-reported outcome that asks patients to rate the severity of their MF symptoms. We are also measuring morphological change in bone marrow fibrosis.
 Preliminary Data from Our MANIFEST Trial
 We presented preliminary clinical and translational data from MANIFEST for pelabresib in combination with ruxolitinib and as a monotherapy in oral and poster presentations at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology, or ASH, in December 2020, based on a September 29, 2020 data cutoff date. The preliminary data, which are summarized below, reflect an analysis of 63 1L patients in Arm 3 and 94 2L or later patients in Arms 1 and 2. We believe that these preliminary data from MANIFEST suggest that pelabresib has the potential to offer meaningful benefits beyond the current standard of care in MF and may have disease-modifying effects.
 Arm 3: Combination of Pelabresib and Ruxolitinib in JAK-Inhibitor-Naïve Patients (1L)
 In Arm 3, we are evaluating the combination of pelabresib and ruxolitinib in JAK-inhibitor-naïve patients with MF. Patients are treated with pelabresib according to the schedule as in Arm 1 and receive a starting dose of either 10 mg or 15 mg twice per day of ruxolitinib, depending on the platelet count at baseline, up to a maximum dose of 25 mg twice per day. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients who achieve a SVR35.

Arm 2:  Pelabresib Add-on to Ruxolitinib in Patients with Suboptimal Response to Ruxolitinib (2L)
 In Arm 2, we are evaluating pelabresib in combination with ruxolitinib, in patients with MF with suboptimal response to ruxolitinib.  Pelabresib is added to treatment with ruxolitinib and pelabresib is dosed according to the schedule as in Arm 1 and patients continue treatment with ruxolitinib at their last stable dose with no titration of ruxolitinib. The primary endpoints are the proportion of patients who achieve a SVR35 for non-TD patients and the rate at which TD patients convert to TI for the cohort of patients who were TD at baseline.

Translational Data
 Patients are evaluable for improvement in bone marrow fibrosis if they have a baseline bone marrow biopsy and at least one post-baseline biopsy after 24 weeks. Bone marrow assessments were made based on a local pathology read. The translational data for change in bone marrow fibrosis is as of the September 29, 2020 data cutoff date.
 In Arm 3, 16 of 48 evaluable patients (33%) with evaluable samples had at least one grade improvement in bone marrow fibrosis, and in 14 of these 16 patients (88%), the improvements occurred within six months of starting treatment in the trial. Two of the 48 evaluable patients had worsening in bone marrow fibrosis.
 In Arm 1, 6 of 29 evaluable patients (21%) with evaluable samples had at least one grade improvement in bone marrow fibrosis, and in five of these six patients (83%), the improvements occurred within six months of starting treatment in the trial. Two of the 29 evaluable patients had worsening in bone marrow fibrosis. 
 In Arm 2, 16 of 39 evaluable patients (41%) with evaluable samples had at least one grade improvement in bone marrow fibrosis, and in 13 of these 16 patients (81%), the improvements occurred within six months of starting treatment in the trial. Three of the 39 evaluable patients had worsening in bone marrow fibrosis. 
 Clinical Safety Data
 We believe that pelabresib may have a differentiated safety profile compared with some other BET inhibitors. Prior to initiating the MANIFEST trial, we treated a total of 138 patients with a variety of hematological malignancies in three Phase 1 clinical trials. In a Phase 1 trial in lymphoma, we identified the maximum tolerated dose of 225 mg per day. In this trial, we saw evidence of clinical activity at a range of doses below this maximum tolerated dose, including the 125 mg starting dose being used in MANIFEST and MANIFEST-2.
 As of September 29, 2020, pelabresib, both as monotherapy and in combination with ruxolitinib, was generally well tolerated in each arm of the MANIFEST trial. In Arm 1, 23 patients remained on active treatment and 23 had discontinued. In Arm 2, 40 patients remained on active treatment and 38 had discontinued. In Arm 3, 66 patients remained on active treatment and 12 had discontinued.

The most common treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, of any grade irrespective of causality observed in 46 evaluable patients in Arm 1 were nausea, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, asthenic conditions, dysgeusia, respiratory tract infections, cough, weight decrease and constipation, each of which occurred in 20% or more of patients. A total of 29 patients (63%) reported at least one grade 3 or higher TEAE. A total of 14 patients reported thrombocytopenia of any grade and seven patients reported anemia of any grade. Of the most common TEAEs, those that were grade 3 were thrombocytopenia (seven patients), diarrhea (two patients) and constipation, respiratory tract infection and weight decrease (one patient each). Other grade 3 or higher TEAEs included anemia (six patients), hyperuricemia (four patients), hyperkalemia (three patients) and dyspnea (three patients). Nine patients discontinued treatment due to TEAEs.
 The most common TEAEs of any grade irrespective of causality observed in 78 evaluable patients in Arm 2 were diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, respiratory tract infections, nausea, asthenic conditions, cough and dysgeusia, each of which occurred in 20% or more of patients. A total of 35 patients reported thrombocytopenia of any grade and 11 patients reported anemia of any grade. A total of 45 patients (58%) reported at least one grade 3 or higher TEAE. Of the most common TEAEs, those that were grade 3 or grade 4 were thrombocytopenia (18 patients with grade 3 and two patients with grade 4), respiratory tract infection (four patients with grade 4), diarrhea (three patients with grade 3), asthenic conditions (three patients with grade 3) and nausea (two patients with grade 3). A total of eight patients reported anemia of grade 3 and one patient reported anemia of grade 4. Nine patients discontinued treatment due to TEAEs, including six grade 5 TEAEs. The grade 5 TEAEs consisted of acute kidney injury, traumatic subdural hematoma (patient tripped and fell), brain stem hemorrhage (no concomitant thrombocytopenia), disease progression, congestive heart failure, and transformation to AML.  
 The most common TEAEs of any grade irrespective of causality observed in 78 evaluable patients in Arm 3 were anemia, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, dysgeusia, asthenic conditions, musculoskeletal pain, respiratory tract infections, nausea, abdominal pain and dizziness, each of which occurred in 15% or more of patients. A total of 26 patients reported anemia of any grade and 25 patients reported thrombocytopenia of any grade. A total of 34 patients (44%) reported at least one grade 3 or higher TEAE. Of the most common TEAEs, those that were grade 3 or grade 4 were anemia (22 patients with grade 3 and one patient with grade 4) and thrombocytopenia (four patients with grade 4 and two patients with Grade 4). Four patients discontinued treatment due to TEAEs, including two grade 5 TEAEs. The grade 5 TEAEs consisted of one patient with multiorgan failure due to sepsis secondary to bacterial endocarditis and one patient with multiorgan failure due to sepsis secondary to community acquired pneumonia.
 Potential Indication Expansion 
 We are exploring potential opportunities to expand our pelabresib indications. For example, we are planning to add a new cohort (Arm 4) in MANIFEST to study pelabresib monotherapy in essential thrombocythemia, or ET. ET is a myeloproliferative disorder that can progress to MF and AML and is characterized by excessive production of platelets, as well as symptoms such as fatigue, lightheadedness, headaches, vision changes, and an increased risk of blood clots.  We believe there is a strong mechanistic rationale for pelabresib in ET, given observed reductions in platelet counts in clinical studies. In MANIFEST we observed normalization of platelet numbers in some patients with very high platelet levels at baseline. We plan to enroll approximately 20 hydroxyurea-resistant or -intolerant patients with ET in this arm. The primary endpoint of this arm of the trial will be Complete Hematological Response within 24 weeks as measured by normalization of platelet count and white blood cell count, with a key secondary endpoint of TSS50 at 24 weeks.  
CPI-0209— Second Generation EZH2 Inhibitor 
 Overview 
 Historically, the primary focus of EZH2 as a drug target has been the role of EZH2 mutations or overexpression in cancer. We believe these genetically defined approaches to EZH2 inhibition may underestimate the broader therapeutic potential of the target in cancer. EZH2 genomic aberrations and overexpression are frequently correlated with late-stage cancer and a poor prognosis for a wide variety of cancers. Furthermore, EZH2 also cooperates with other cancer-promoting pathways, such as androgen receptor signaling and immune signaling. Therefore, we believe EZH2 inhibition can synergistically enhance the effectiveness of existing cancer therapies. 
EZH2 Inhibition in Cancer 
 EZH2 acts as an epigenetic writer and normally regulates gene expression by placing one or more methyl groups on a histone protein leading to the suppression of gene expression programs. While this effect of EZH2 on gene expression is a normal part of cellular development, some cancers depend on an abnormal pattern of gene expression and re-direct EZH2 to genes that become abnormally repressed. Cancer cells with these abnormal gene expression programs may be more resistant to anti-cancer therapies. 
 9


Abnormal EZH2 function has been implicated in cancer in a number of ways: 
  
• | Cancer genetics: mutations in the gene encoding EZH2 result in the altered enzymatic activity of EZH2, and cancer cells become dependent on this abnormal activity for tumor growth. Alternatively, mutations in other epigenetic regulators can change the genes expressed by cancer cells and indirectly create a dependence on EZH2 for cancer cell growth;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Acquired drug resistance: therapeutic agents promote EZH2-mediated gene silencing that may lead to acquired resistance to these agents;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Immune suppression: EZH2 mediates reprogramming of immune cells within the tumor, e.g., T-cells, and tumor cells to create an immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Oncogenic driver synergy: EZH2 suppresses the expression of sets of genes that promote tumor progression in the context of validated oncogenic drivers, such as the androgen receptor signaling pathway in prostate cancer. Combined inhibition of EZH2 and the oncogenic driver pathway may elicit a synergistic impact on tumor growth.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Development of CPI-0209
 We designed CPI-0209, our second-generation EZH2 inhibitor, to achieve comprehensive coverage of EZH2 to potentially enable rapid and durable tumor regression. We believe that such a product could enable us to expand the addressable patient populations beyond those that have been targeted by first-generation EZH2 inhibitors. We are currently conducting the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of CPI-0209 in solid tumors. The Phase 1 dose escalation phase of the clinical trial studies CPI-0209 as a monotherapy in advanced cancer patients. At the 2021 J.P. Morgan Healthcare conference, we disclosed preliminary data showing dose-dependent increases in pharmacodynamic markers in the blood of patients who received CPI-0209. After determining the recommended Phase 2 dose as a monotherapy, we intend to pursue monotherapy expansion arms in selected solid tumor and hematologic indications, as well as assessing combination therapy development and a biomarker strategy that includes ARID1A and other mutations. 
 In preclinical studies, we observed that CPI-0209 bound to EZH2 more durably and with higher affinity when compared to first-generation EZH2 inhibitors. We believe that these characteristics may enable CPI-0209 to increase the level and duration of EZH2 inhibition compared to that of first-generation EZH2 inhibitors. Product candidates that provide more comprehensive and longer inhibition of EZH2 may treat certain cancer types requiring that effect. We believe that the level of EZH2 inhibition necessary to produce a therapeutic effect varies across cancer types based on our preclinical studies where we have observed that the dose required to affect tumor growth is higher in certain cancer types. As illustrated below left, we have also observed that CPI-0209 produced tumor regression beginning after five days of initiation of treatment in a lymphoma xenograft mouse model. At right, CPI-0209 demonstrated greater tumor regression in a mutated ARID1A model in bladder cancer compared to other EZH2 inhibitors.  Based on this, we hypothesize that CPI-0209 can potentially be effective in other tumor models where first-generation EZH2 inhibitors would be less effective.
 Rapid and Durable Tumor Regression in Lymphoma Xenograft Mutated EZH2 Model (left) and Bladder Cancer Mutated ARID1A Model (right)
 

We plan to develop CPI-0209 for the treatment of hematologic and solid tumors. We believe that mutations can render tumor cells dependent on the activity of EZH2 and that cancer cells can use EZH2 as a resistance mechanism against therapeutic agents. We are considering developing CPI-0209 in one or more of these contexts. 
 10


CPI 1205
 CPI-1205 is a small molecule designed to promote anti-tumor activity by specifically inhibiting EZH2. ProSTAR is an open-label Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of CPI-1205, a potent and highly selective small-molecule EZH2 inhibitor, in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in the second-line setting. The ProSTAR study evaluated CPI-1205 in combination with either enzalutamide or abiraterone / prednisone (“abiraterone”), which are ARS inhibitors, in mCRPC patients who experienced disease progression while receiving the other ARS inhibitor. In June 2020, we announced that we plan to discontinue development of CPI-1205 after completion of the Phase 2 ProSTAR study in mCRPC and to prioritize further clinical development of CPI-0209. The decision was based on a review of ProSTAR data, which did not demonstrate the definitive signal of activity necessary to advance the program into pivotal studies. We intend to present a full data set from ProSTAR at a future medical meeting.
Discovery Programs 
 We are currently advancing several programs against additional epigenetic regulators focused on the tumor and the immune microenvironment. To date, our epigenetics efforts in cancer have been focused on pathways relevant for immune cell re-programming to drive tumor rejection or to increase direct tumor cell killing. We remain committed to advancing programs that normalize abnormal cell gene expression within cancer cells. 
Sales and Marketing 
 In light of our stage of development, we have not yet established a full commercial organization or distribution capabilities. To date, we have retained worldwide commercial rights for our product candidates. If our product candidates receive marketing approval, we plan to commercialize them in the United States with our own focused specialty sales force. 
Manufacturing 
 We do not have any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely on, and expect to continue to rely on, third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. We have entered into clinical supply agreements with contract manufacturers. 
 We obtain clinical trial materials for our product candidates using multiple third-party contract manufacturing organizations. We engage separate third-party manufacturers for producing active pharmaceutical ingredients and other manufacturers for making solid oral drug products
 All of our product candidates are small molecules and are manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. The chemistry is amenable to scale up and does not require unusual equipment. We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities. 
 Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience, and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from many sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 There are a large number of companies developing or marketing treatments for cancer, including many large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. In addition, many companies are developing cancer therapies that work by targeting epigenetic mechanisms. 
 Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, clinical testing, regulatory review, and marketing than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites, and enrolling patients in clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to or competitive with our programs. 
 11


The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our therapeutic product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, and price, the availability and effectiveness of related companion diagnostics in guiding the use of related therapeutics, the level of generic competition, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer or more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient, or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we can for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we can enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payers seeking to encourage the use of generic products. Generic products that broadly address these indications are currently on the market for the indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our product candidates achieve marketing approval, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products. 
 The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation, and drug therapy. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. While our product candidates may compete with many existing drug and other therapies, to the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our product candidates will not compete with them. Some of the currently approved drug therapies are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved drugs are well established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients, and third-party payers. 
 In addition to currently marketed therapies, there are also a number of products in late-stage clinical development to treat cancer. These products in development may provide efficacy, safety, convenience, and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide significant competition for any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. 
 If our lead product candidates are approved for the indications that we are currently pursuing in our on-going clinical trials, they will compete with the therapies and currently marketed drugs discussed below. 
 Pelabresib / Myelofibrosis 
 Ruxolitinib, a JAK inhibitor developed and marketed by Incyte, was approved by the FDA in 2011 as a first-line treatment for intermediate- and high-risk MF patients. Fedratinib (Inrebic®), a JAK2/FLT3 selective inhibitor was approved by the FDA in August 2019 and is now marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb. Many companies are developing product candidates or combination regimens that may compete with pelabresib, if approved. 
 Incyte is developing treatments for first- and second-line therapy in patients with MF that combine ruxolitinib with PI3 kinase inhibitors, activin-like receptor kinase 2 (ALK2), CXCR4 enriched, allogeneic, umbilical cord blood-derived T-regulatory cells, and BET inhibitors. Incyte may develop these combinations in a co-formulated oral dosage form, which could increase the convenience of these combination regimens.
 There are several other companies developing JAK inhibitors as a first-line and second-line treatment of patients with MF. Celgene Corporation (Celgene”), acquired fedratinib in January 2018 as part of its acquisition of Impact Biosciences, Inc. In November 2019, Bristol-Myers Squibb (“BMS”) acquired Celgene. Fedratinib has been evaluated in clinical trials as first- and second-line treatments for MF. BMS has initiated a substudy of the FREEDOM Phase 3 trial to evaluate fedratinib in combination with the erythroid maturation agent luspatercept in relapsed/refractory MF patients. CTI Biopharma Corp. (“CTI”) is conducting a Phase 3 trial of pacritinib in MF patients with severe thrombocytopenia in the United States. On February 10, 2020, CTI disclosed that it had reached agreement with the FDA on an accelerated approval pathway for pacritinib, subject to submission of SVR data from the first 168 patients enrolled in the ongoing Phase 3 PACIFICA trial. Nippon Shinyaku is conducting a Phase 2 trial with NS-018 in patients with MF. Sierra Oncology is developing momelotinib, a JAK1/ACVR1 inhibitor for MF and associated anemia. 
 Pelabresib could face competition from products with different biological targets that are in development as a therapeutic option for patients with MF with prior exposure to ruxolitinib, including as a monotherapy or in combination with ruxolitinib. These products include kinase inhibitors, telomerase inhibitors, Bcl-2 inhibitors, and other epigenetic inhibitors. Geron Corporation is conducting a Phase 2 trial evaluating imetelstat, a telomerase inhibitor, in patients with MF who have relapsed after or are refractory to prior treatment with a JAK inhibitor. Imago BioSciences, Inc., is conducting a Phase 1 trial of IMG-7289, an inhibitor of LSD1, which is an epigenetic target, in patients with MF. MEI Pharma, Inc., and Helsinn are conducting a Phase 2 trial of pracinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor in MF patients on treatment with ruxolitinib.  AbbVie is 
 12


conducting Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials of navitoclax, a Bcl-2/XL inhibitor in combination with ruxolitinib in JAK-inhibitor-naive MF patients and MF patients already on treatment with ruxolitinib.
 We are aware of several companies that are developing BET inhibitors, including AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb, GlaxoSmithKline, Incyte, Boehringer Ingelheim, TG Therapeutics, Nuvation Bio, and Zenith Epigenetics. 
 CPI-0209
 CPI-0209 could face competition from tazemetostat (marketed as TAZVERIK by Epizyme, Inc.).  Tazverik was approved in January 2020 for patients with epithelioid sarcoma, and in June 2020 for patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma.  Epizyme is conducting Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials with tazemetostat in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.  We are aware of several companies that are developing EZH1/EZH2 inhibitors, including Daiichi Sankyo Company, Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co., Ltd., and Pfizer Inc.  Novartis AG, Oric Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Ascentage Pharma are developing embryonic ectoderm development (EED) inhibitors, which target an alternative subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which can also inhibit EZH1/EZH2 activity.    
 Intellectual Property 
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including by seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of epigenetic small molecule drug discovery. 
 Our future commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to: obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing, misappropriating or violating the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. With respect to both our owned and licensed intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will issue with respect to any of our owned or licensed pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications that we or our licensors may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our owned or licensed patents or any patents that may be issued in the future to us or our licensors will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates and methods of manufacturing the same. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain patent protection for certain of our product candidates generally as well as with respect to certain indications. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our intellectual property” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property. We generally file patent applications directed to our key programs, including CPI-0209 and pelabresib, in an effort to establish our intellectual property positions regarding new compositions relating to these programs as well as uses of these and similar compositions in the treatment of relevant diseases. We also seek patent protection with respect to methods of making these compositions and to biomarkers that may be useful in establishing or monitoring the efficacy of these compositions in patients. As of January 1, 2021, we owned 25 issued or allowed U.S. patents, 14 U.S. pending non-provisional patent applications, 192 issued or allowed foreign patents, 79 foreign pending patent applications, 24 pending Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications and 4 U.S. provisional patent applications.  Additionally, our epigenetics platform is not protected by any patented intellectual property. 
 The intellectual property portfolios for our most advanced programs as of January 1, 2021, are summarized below. Prosecution is a lengthy process, during which the scope of the claims initially submitted for examination by the USPTO can be significantly narrowed by the time they issue, if they issue at all. We expect this could be the case with respect to some of our pending patent applications referred to below. 
 Pelabresib / BET Inhibitor Program 
 The intellectual property portfolio for our pelabresib program includes patents and applications directed to compositions of matter generically and specifically covering pelabresib and related BET inhibitors, as well as to methods for using and making these novel compositions. We also have patents and applications covering extended uses of pelabresib for treating select patient subtypes, such as myelofibrosis.  As of January 1, 2021, we owned four issued or allowed U.S. patents, two issued or allowed European Patent Office patents, seven pending PCT applications, one U.S. provisional patent application, and approximately 89 foreign patents and patent applications in a number of other jurisdictions relating to our pelabresib program. The U.S. or ex-U.S. issued patents or patents issuing from these pending applications, if any, for our pelabresib 
 13


program are projected to have a statutory expiration date from December 2031 to June 2041, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. 
 In addition to patent protection, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and confidential know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. However, trade secrets and confidential know-how are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with any future collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have agreements requiring assignment of inventions with selected consultants, scientific advisors and collaborators. These agreements may not provide meaningful protection. These agreements may also be breached, and we may not have an adequate remedy for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets and/or confidential know-how may become known or be independently developed by a third party or misused by any collaborator to whom we disclose such information. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain or use information that we regard as proprietary. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information, third parties may independently develop the same or similar proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to our proprietary information. As a result, we may be unable to meaningfully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our intellectual property” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property. 
CPI-0209 / Second-Generation EZH2 Inhibitor Program 
 The intellectual property portfolio for our CPI-0209 program includes patents and applications directed to compositions of matter generically and specifically covering CPI-0209 and related EZH2 inhibitors, as well as to methods for using and making these novel compositions. As of January 1, 2021, we owned one issued U.S. patent, one pending U.S. non-provisional applications, three pending PCT applications, one U.S. provisional patent application, and 28 foreign patent applications in a number of other jurisdictions relating to our CPI-0209 program. The U.S. or ex-U.S. issued patents or patents issuing from the pending applications, if any, for our CPI-0209 program are projected to have a statutory expiration date from April 2039 to July 2041. While we intend to timely file non-provisional patent applications relating to our provisional patent application, we cannot predict whether any of our future patent applications for CPI-0209 or any other future product candidates will result in the issuance of patents that effectively protect CPI-0209 and any other future product candidates, or if any of our or our licensors’ issued patents will effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive products. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing or in some cases not at all until they are issued as a patent. Therefore, we and our licensors cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our licensed patents, patents we own in the future, or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. 
License and Collaboration Agreements 
 Research, Development and Commercialization Agreement with the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society 
 In July 2012, we entered into a research, development and commercialization agreement with the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, or LLS. We refer to the agreement as the LLS Agreement. Under the LLS Agreement, LLS agreed to provide funding for the development of a compound targeted toward certain tandem bromodomain-containing proteins, designed for and researched for use in the treatment of lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myelogenous leukemia or multiple myeloma, or the Field, in accordance with an agreed-upon budget and milestones, which we call the research program. The LLS Agreement initially required us to perform the development activities on a compound that we are no longer developing. We and LLS amended the LLS Agreement in April 2013 to allow us to propose alternative compounds to LLS and for LLS to decide whether it would fund the research program for an alternative compound. We proposed pelabresib, and LLS agreed to fund pelabresib as the alternative compound in June 2013. We and LLS further amended the LLS Agreement in June 2013, June 2014 and March 2016 to reflect changes to the research program milestones. 
 LLS has agreed to pay us up to $7.5 million, or the LLS Funding, toward the costs of the research program. We may use such funding solely to pay or reimburse expenses of the research program in accordance with an agreed-upon budget. As of December 31, 2018, LLS has paid us $7.3 million in aggregate, and no additional funding was paid in the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. We are obligated, and have to date provided funding, to match LLS’s funding to support the research program. 
 We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct the research program substantially in accordance with an agreed-upon research plan with the goal of developing an LLS Product for commercial sale. Once the research program is complete, we are obligated to use, at our own expense, commercially reasonable efforts to develop at least one LLS Product in the Field in the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom or Japan, or the major market countries, and, following receipt of regulatory approval for at least one LLS Product in any major market country, to commercialize the 
 14


LLS Product in the Field in such country. If we fail to meet the foregoing obligation, then, under certain circumstances, LLS may terminate the agreement and LLS may exercise the exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license we granted LLS in certain of our intellectual property to develop and commercialize pelabresib. 
 We are obligated to pay to LLS up to $25 million, which would be payable in variable portions based on our execution of any agreement to license or permanently transfer rights to pelabresib or an LLS Product to an unaffiliated third party, on the closing of a change of control of our company, or on the receipt of regulatory approval in certain of the major market countries, which we refer to as the Payment Cap Payments. Our payment obligations to LLS continue until satisfied and otherwise only terminate upon a termination of the LLS Agreement by us in the event of a material breach by LLS. The LLS Agreement expires when there are no longer any payment obligations owing from one party to the other with respect to any of these provisions. 
 We and LLS may terminate the LLS agreement for a material breach by the other party that is not cured within a specified period. LLS may terminate the LLS Agreement if we are debarred by the FDA or excluded from health care programs, or if we knowingly use for any services under the LLS Agreement any individual or entity who is debarred or excluded, or if we undergo certain bankruptcy events. If LLS terminates the LLS Agreement because we are debarred by the FDA or excluded from health care programs, or knowingly use the services of any individual or entity who is debarred or excluded for any services under the LLS Agreement, or we materially breach the LLS Agreement and do not cure within the specified time period, we are obligated to repay LLS the LLS Funding and, if we continue development of the LLS Product thereafter, we also must pay LLS the Payment Cap Payments. 
 Government Regulation and Product Approvals 
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, pricing, reimbursement, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of biopharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 Approval and Regulation of Drugs in the United States 
 In the United States, drug products are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and applicable implementing regulations and guidance. The failure of an applicant to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, including non-clinical testing, clinical testing, the approval process or post-approval process, may result in delays to the conduct of a study, regulatory review and approval and/or administrative or judicial sanctions. 
 An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug in the United States generally must satisfactorily complete each of the following steps before the product candidate will be approved by the FDA: 
  
• | preclinical testing including laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies, which must be performed in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations and standards;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies 
 Before an applicant begins testing a product candidate with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage, including in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as other studies to evaluate, among other things, the toxicity of the product candidate. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity and long-term toxicity studies may continue after the IND is submitted. 
 The IND and IRB Processes 
 An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any product candidate that is not the subject of an approved NDA. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial, and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period or thereafter, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In these cases, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. 
 Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. Clinical holds are imposed by the FDA whenever there is concern for patient safety and may be a result of new data, findings, or developments in clinical, nonclinical, and/or chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC).  A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol may not be allowed to proceed, while other protocols may be allowed. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, a clinical trial may only resume after the FDA has so notified the sponsor. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the clinical trial can proceed. 
 A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When a foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain regulatory requirements of the FDA in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies. 
 In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, 
 16


if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee, or DSMB. This group provides authorization as to whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or the competitive environment. 
 Information about clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website.   
 Expanded Access to an Investigational Drug for Treatment Use
 Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational new drug products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational drugs for patients who may benefit from investigational therapies. FDA regulations allow access to investigational drugs under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the drug under a treatment protocol or Treatment IND Application. 
 When considering an IND application for expanded access to an investigational product with the purpose of treating a patient or a group of patients, the sponsor and treating physicians or investigators will determine suitability when all of the following criteria apply: patient(s) have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context or condition to be treated; and the expanded use of the investigational drug for the requested treatment will not interfere initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the product or otherwise compromise the potential development of the product.
 There is no obligation for a sponsor to make its drug products available for expanded access; however, as required by the 21st Century Cures Act (the “Cures Act”), passed in 2016, if a sponsor has a policy regarding how it responds to expanded access requests, it must make that policy publicly available. This requirement applies upon the earlier of initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 study; or 15 days after the investigational drug or biologic receives designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy. 
 In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy.
 Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of a qualified investigator in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written clinical trial protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Additional studies may also be required after approval. 
 Phase 1 clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, including adverse effects, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and pharmacodynamics in healthy humans or in patients. During Phase 1 clinical trials, information about the investigational drug product’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials. 
 17


Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications and determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more costly Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 2 clinical trials are well controlled, closely monitored and conducted in a limited patient population. 
 Phase 3 clinical trials proceed if the Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken within an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. A well-controlled, statistically robust Phase 3 clinical trial may be designed to deliver the data that regulatory authorities will use to decide whether or not to approve, and, if approved, how to appropriately label a drug. Such Phase 3 studies are referred to as “pivotal.” 
 In some cases, the FDA may approve an NDA for a product candidate but require the sponsor to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product candidate’s safety and effectiveness after approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of a larger number of patients in the intended treatment group and to further document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under Accelerated Approval regulations. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products. 
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies.  They must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity and potency of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 Pediatric Studies
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time. 
 For drugs intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, the FDA must, upon the request of an applicant, meet to discuss preparation of the initial pediatric study plan or to discuss deferral or waiver of pediatric assessments. In addition, the FDA will meet early in the development process to discuss pediatric study plans with sponsors, and the FDA must meet with sponsors by no later than the end-of-phase 1 meeting for serious or life-threatening diseases and by no later than ninety (90) days after the FDA’s receipt of the study plan. 
 18


The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA.  The FDA maintains a list of diseases that are exempt from PREA requirements due to low prevalence of disease in the pediatric population. Congress amended the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, or FDARA. Previously, drugs that had been granted orphan drug designation were exempt from the requirements of the Pediatric Research Equity Act. Under the amended section 505B, beginning on August 18, 2020, the submission of a pediatric assessment, waiver or deferral will be required for certain molecularly targeted cancer indications with the submission of an application or supplement to an application.
The FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 established new requirements to govern certain molecularly targeted cancer indications. Any company that submits an NDA three years after the date of enactment of that statute must submit pediatric assessments with the NDA if the drug is intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer. The investigation must be designed to yield clinically meaningful pediatric study data regarding the dosing, safety and preliminary efficacy to inform pediatric labeling for the product. 
 Review and Approval of an NDA 
 In order to obtain approval to market a drug product in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides sufficient data establishing the safety, purity and potency of the proposed drug product for its intended indication. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by independent investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety, purity and potency of the drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. 
 The NDA is a vehicle through which applicants formally propose that the FDA approve a new product for marketing and sale in the United States for one or more indications. Every new non-biologic drug product candidate must be the subject of an approved NDA before it may be commercialized in the United States. Biologic Licensing Applications, of BLAs, are submitted for approval of biologic products. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2021 is $2,875,842 for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee, which for fiscal year 2021 is $336,432. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for products with orphan designation, an exception from the program fee when the program does not engage in manufacturing the drug during a particular fiscal year and a waiver for certain small businesses. 
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of the application, generally within 60 calendar days of its receipt, and strives to inform the sponsor within 74 days whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept the application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Under that agreement, 90% of applications seeking approval of New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date on which the FDA accepts the application for filing, and 90% of applications for NMEs that have been designated for Priority Review are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date. For applications seeking approval of products that are not NMEs, the ten-month and six-month review periods run from the date that the FDA receives the application. The review process and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, goal date may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. 
 Before approving an application, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is being or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including component manufacturing, finished product manufacturing and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Under the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, the FDA must implement a protocol to expedite review of responses to inspection reports pertaining to certain applications, including applications for products in shortage or those for which approval is dependent on remediation of conditions identified in the inspection report. 
 19


The FDA may refer an application for a novel product to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that review, evaluate and provide a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but the FDA considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Priority Review and Regenerative Advanced Therapy Designations 
 The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are referred to as Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review designation and Regenerative Advanced Therapy designation. 
 Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interaction with the FDA, and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information, and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time-period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
 A product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner. 
 The FDA may designate a product for Priority Review if it treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A Priority Review designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months. 
 With passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as Regenerative Advanced Therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a Regenerative Advanced Therapy designation include early interactions with the FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for Priority Review and Accelerated Approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints. 
 Accelerated Approval Pathway 
 The FDA may grant Accelerated Approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant Accelerated Approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted Accelerated Approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval. 
 20


For the purposes of Accelerated Approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with Accelerated Approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support Accelerated Approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a product. 
 The Accelerated Approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, Accelerated Approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. Thus, the benefit of Accelerated Approval derives from the potential to receive approval based on surrogate endpoints sooner than possible for trials with clinical or survival endpoints, rather than deriving from any explicit shortening of the FDA approval timeline, as is the case with Priority Review. 
 The Accelerated Approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to initiate expedited proceedings to withdraw approval of the product. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. 
 The FDA’s Decision on an NDA 
 On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the application and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter, or CRL. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 If the FDA approves a new product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, or require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval. The agency may also require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including a REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. REMS programs can include medication guides, communication plans for health care professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patent registries. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. The FDA may require a REMS before or after approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, changing manufacturing processes and adding labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 Post-Approval Regulation 
 If regulatory approval for marketing of a product or new indication for an existing product is obtained, the sponsor will be required to comply with all regular post-approval regulatory requirements as well as any post-approval requirements that the FDA may have imposed as part of the approval process. The sponsor will be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and manufacturing problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling requirements. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP regulations, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon manufacturers. 
 21


Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Accordingly, the sponsor and its third-party manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP regulations and other regulatory requirements. 
 A product may also be subject to official lot release, meaning that the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA samples of each lot, together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. Finally, the FDA will conduct laboratory research related to the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of pharmaceutical products. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drug products placed on the market. This regulation includes, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. Promotional claims about a drug’s safety or effectiveness are prohibited before the drug is approved. After approval, a drug product generally may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA, as reflected in the product’s prescribing information. In the United States, health care professionals are generally permitted to prescribe drugs for such uses not described in the drug’s labeling, known as off-label uses, because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose rigorous restrictions on manufacturers’ communications, prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. It may be permissible, under very specific, narrow conditions, for a manufacturer to engage in nonpromotional, non-misleading communication regarding off-label information, such as distributing scientific or medical journal information. 
 If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. 
 Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs 
 In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress established an abbreviated regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve generic drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs. 
 Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, route of administration, dosage form, strength and conditions of use of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is bioequivalent to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.” Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic 
 22


drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or the patient. 
 Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. 
 Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay 
 Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. 
 Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that: 
  
• | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


• | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the applicant is not seeking approval). 
 If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, the expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
 Pediatric Exclusivity 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application.
 23


Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. A company must seek orphan drug designation before submitting an NDA for the candidate product. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the PDUFA goal dates for the regulatory review and approval process, although it does convey certain advantages such as tax benefits and exemption from the PDUFA application fee. 
 If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same drug for the same condition for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different product for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same product for different conditions. If a drug designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. 
 Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same drug for the same condition is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. This is the case despite an earlier court opinion holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously required the FDA to recognize orphan exclusivity regardless of a showing of clinical superiority. 
 Patent Term Restoration and Extension 
 A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted on a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date of a clinical investigation involving human beings is begun and the submission date of an application, plus the time between the submission date of an application and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and only those claims covering the approved product, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Additionally, the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The United States Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA. 
 FDA Approval of Companion Diagnostics
 If safe and effective use of a therapeutic depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of that diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product.  In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, if FDA determines that a companion diagnostic device is essential to the safe and effective use of a novel therapeutic product or indication, FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic product or new therapeutic product indication if the companion diagnostic device is not approved or cleared for that indication.  Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. 
 The 2014 guidance also explains that a companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a biologic product candidate generally will be considered an investigational device, unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulations. Thus, the sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a product are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same investigational study, if the study meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the study plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND alone, or both an IND and an IDE.
 24


The FDA previously has required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to the product candidate to obtain pre-market approval, or PMA, simultaneously with approval of the therapeutic product candidate.  The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling.  PMA applications are subject to an application fee, for federal fiscal year 2021, the standard fee is $365,657 and the small business fee is $91,414.
 A clinical trial is typically required for a PMA application and, in a small percentage of cases, the FDA may require a clinical study in support of a 510(k) submission. A manufacturer that wishes to conduct a clinical study involving the device is subject to the FDA’s IDE regulation. The IDE regulation distinguishes between significant and non-significant risk device studies and the procedures for obtaining approval to begin the study differ accordingly. Also, some types of studies are exempt from the IDE regulations. A significant risk device presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. Significant risk devices are devices that are substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease or in preventing impairment to human health. Studies of devices that pose a significant risk require both FDA and an IRB approval prior to initiation of a clinical study. Non-significant risk devices are devices that do not pose a significant risk to the human subjects. A non-significant risk device study requires only IRB approval prior to initiation of a clinical study.
 Health Care Law and Regulation 
 Health care providers and third-party payers play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payers and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, patient privacy laws and regulations and other health care laws and regulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state health care laws and regulations, include the following: 

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the United States Department of Health and Human
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to health care items or services that are reimbursed by non-government third-party payers, including private insurers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Further, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. Additionally, some state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives in the jurisdiction. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage and Health Care Reform 
 In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the associated health care costs. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payers, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. 
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payer not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payer’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payer’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payers will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payer to payer. 
 The containment of health care costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and biologics and other medical products, government control and other changes to the health care system in the United States. 
 In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for drug products under government health care programs. 
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030 under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, 
 26


and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act.  The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used. 
 Since enactment of the ACA, there have been, and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed by President Trump on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective in 2019. Further, on December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the ACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit court affirmed the lower court’s ruling that the individual mandate portion of the ACA is unconstitutional, and it remanded the case to the district court for reconsideration of the severability question and additional analysis of the provisions of the ACA.  Thereafter, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear this case. Oral argument in the case took place on November 10, 2020.  On February 10, 2021, the Biden Administration withdrew DOJ’s support for this lawsuit.  A ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court is expected sometime this year. Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.
 The Trump Administration also took executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the ACA, including directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices.  On January 28, 2021, however, President Biden rescinded those orders and issued a new Executive Order which directs federal agencies to reconsider rules and other policies that limit Americans’ access to health care and consider actions that will protect and strengthen that access.  Under this Order, federal agencies are directed to re-examine: policies that undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions, including complications related to COVID-19; demonstrations and waivers under Medicaid and the ACA that may reduce coverage or undermine the programs, including work requirements; policies that undermine the Health Insurance Marketplace or other markets for health insurance; policies that make it more difficult to enroll in Medicaid and the ACA; and policies that reduce affordability of coverage or financial assistance, including for dependents. 
 The costs of prescription pharmaceuticals have also been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States To date, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries, as well as proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products.  To those ends, President Trump issued five executive orders intended to lower the costs of prescription drug products, but it is unclear whether, and to what extent, these orders will remain in force under the Biden Administration.  Further, on September 24, 2020, the Trump Administration finalized a rulemaking allowing states or certain other non-federal government entities to submit importation program proposals to the FDA for review and approval. Applicants are required to demonstrate that their importation plans pose no additional risk to public health and safety and will result in significant cost savings for consumers.  The FDA has issued draft guidance that would allow manufacturers to import their own FDA-approved drugs that are authorized for sale in other countries (multi-market approved products).  
 At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
 Review and Approval of Medicinal Products in the European Union 
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains 
 27


FDA approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. Specifically, however, the process governing approval of medicinal products in the European Union, or EU, generally follows the same lines as in the United States. It entails satisfactory completion of preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication. It also requires the submission to the relevant competent authorities of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, and granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the EU. 
 Clinical Trial Approval 
 The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP and the related national implementing provisions of the individual member states of the European Union, or EU Member States, govern the system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU. Under this system, an applicant must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by, among other documents, an investigational medicinal product dossier (the Common Technical Document) with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2005/28/EC, where relevant the implementing national provisions of the individual EU Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. 
 In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. The new Clinical Trials Regulation will become directly applicable to and binding in all 28 EU Member States without the need for any national implementing legislation. It will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the EU. Specifically, the new legislation aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval of clinical trials, the sponsor of a clinical trial will be required to submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial to a reporting EU Member State (RMS) through an EU Portal. The submission procedure will be the same irrespective of whether the clinical trial is to be conducted in a single EU Member State or in more than one EU Member State.  
 The Regulation was published on June 16, 2014 but has not yet become effective.  In January 2020, the website of the European Commission reported that the implementation of the Clinical Trials Regulation was dependent on the development of a fully functional clinical trials portal and database, which would be confirmed by an independent audit, and that the new legislation would come into effect six months after the European Commission publishes a notice of this confirmation. The website indicated that the audit was expected to commence in December 2020. In late 2020, the EMA indicated that it plans to focus on the findings of a system audit; improving the usability, quality and stability of the clinical trial information system; and knowledge transfer to prepare users and their organizations for the new clinical trial system.  The EMA has indicated that the system will go live in December 2021.
 Parties conducting certain clinical studies must, as in the U.S., post clinical trial information in the European Union at the EudraCT website: https://eudract.ema.europa.eu. 
 PRIME Designation in the EU 
 In March 2016, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises, or SMEs, may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated Agency contact and rapporteur from the Committee for Human Medicinal Products, or CHMP, or Committee for Advanced Therapies, or CAT, are appointed early in PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s Committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies. 
 28


Paediatric Studies 
 Prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, applicants must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved PIP covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. The respective requirements for all marketing authorization procedures are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the so-called Paediatric Regulation. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The Paediatric Committee of the EMA, or PDCO, may grant deferrals for some medicines, allowing a company to delay development of the medicine for children until there is enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults. The PDCO may also grant waivers when development of a medicine for children is not needed or is not appropriate, such as for diseases that only affect the elderly population. Before an MAA can be filed, or an existing marketing authorization can be amended, the EMA determines that companies actually comply with the agreed studies and measures listed in each relevant PIP.
Marketing Authorization 
 To obtain a marketing authorization for a product under EU regulatory systems, an applicant must submit an MAA either under a centralized procedure administered by the EMA, or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in the EU Member States (decentralized procedure, national procedure or mutual recognition procedure). A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the EU. Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 provides that prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the EU, applicants have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Paediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted (1) a product-specific waiver, (2) a class waiver or (3) a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. 
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid across the European Economic Area (i.e., the EU as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including products for the treatment of cancer. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional. The centralized procedure may at the request of the applicant also be used in certain other cases. We anticipate that the centralized procedure will be mandatory for the product candidates we are developing. 
 Under the centralized procedure, the CHMP is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product and for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days but it is possible that the CHMP can revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it considers that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. At the end of this period, the CHMP provides a scientific opinion on whether or not a marketing authorization should be granted in relation to a medicinal product. Within 15 calendar days of receipt of a final opinion from the CHMP, the European Commission must prepare a draft decision concerning an application for marketing authorization. This draft decision must take the opinion and any relevant provisions of EU law into account. Before arriving at a final decision on an application for centralized authorization of a medicinal product the European Commission must consult the Standing Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use. The Standing Committee is composed of representatives of the EU Member States and chaired by a non-voting European Commission representative. The European Parliament also has a related “droit de regard”. The European Parliament’s role is to ensure that the European Commission has not exceeded its powers in deciding to grant or refuse to grant a marketing authorization. 
 The European Commission may grant a so-called “marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances”. Such authorization is intended for products for which the applicant can demonstrate that it is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use, because the indications for which the product in question is intended are encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence, or in the present state of scientific knowledge, comprehensive information cannot be provided, or it would be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical ethics to collect such information. Consequently, marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances may be granted subject to certain specific obligations, which may include the following: 
  
• | the applicant must complete an identified program of studies within a time period specified by the competent authority, the results of which form the basis of a reassessment of the benefit/risk profile;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 29


 
• | the medicinal product in question may be supplied on medical prescription only and may in certain cases be administered only under strict medical supervision, possibly in a hospital and in the case of a radiopharmaceutical, by an authorized person; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the package leaflet and any medical information must draw the attention of the medical practitioner to the fact that the particulars available concerning the medicinal product in question are as yet inadequate in certain specified respects.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances is subject to annual review to reassess the risk-benefit balance in an annual reassessment procedure. Continuation of the authorization is linked to the annual reassessment and a negative assessment could potentially result in the marketing authorization being suspended or revoked. The renewal of a marketing authorization of a medicinal product under exceptional circumstances, however, follows the same rules as a “normal” marketing authorization. Thus, a marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances is granted for an initial five years, after which the authorization will become valid indefinitely, unless the EMA decides that safety grounds merit one additional five-year renewal. 
 The European Commission may also grant a so-called “conditional marketing authorization” prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for an application for a full marketing authorization. Such conditional marketing authorizations may be granted for product candidates (including medicines designated as orphan medicinal products), if (i) the risk-benefit balance of the product candidate is positive, (ii) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (iii) the product fulfills an unmet medical need and (iv) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. A conditional marketing authorization may contain specific obligations to be fulfilled by the marketing authorization holder, including obligations with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions and/or specific obligations. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to the review by the CHMP of applications for a conditional marketing authorization. 
 The EU medicines rules expressly permit the EU Member States to adopt national legislation prohibiting or restricting the sale, supply or use of any medicinal product containing, consisting of or derived from a specific type of human or animal cell, such as embryonic stem cells. While the products we have in development do not make use of embryonic stem cells, it is possible that the national laws in certain EU Member States may prohibit or restrict us from commercializing our products, even if they have been granted an EU marketing authorization. 
 Unlike the centralized authorization procedure, the decentralized marketing authorization procedure requires a separate application to, and leads to separate approval by, the competent authorities of each EU Member State in which the product is to be marketed. This application is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States who, within 90 days of receipt, must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all EU Member States. 
 The mutual recognition procedure similarly is based on the acceptance by the competent authorities of the EU Member States of the marketing authorization of a medicinal product by the competent authorities of other EU Member States. The holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the competent authority of an EU Member State requesting that this authority recognize the marketing authorization delivered by the competent authority of another EU Member State. 
 Regulatory Data Protection in the EU 
 In the EU, innovative medicinal products approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity pursuant to Directive 2001/83/EC. Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 repeats this entitlement for medicinal products authorized in accordance the centralized authorization procedure. Data exclusivity prevents applicants for authorization of generics of these innovative products from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abridged) application for a period of eight years. During an additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization application can be submitted and authorized, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be placed on the EU market until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a 
 30


significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials. 
 Periods of Authorization and Renewals 
 A marketing authorization has an initial validity for five years in principle. The marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the EU Member State. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. The European Commission or the competent authorities of the EU Member States may decide, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one further five-year period of marketing authorization. Once subsequently definitively renewed, the marketing authorization shall be valid for an unlimited period. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the medicinal product on the EU market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing EU Member State within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause). 
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000, as implemented by Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provides that a drug can be designated as an orphan drug by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the EU when the application is made, or (2) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. 
 Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to 10 years of market exclusivity in all EU Member States and in addition a range of other benefits during the development and regulatory review process including scientific assistance for study protocols, authorization through the centralized marketing authorization procedure covering all member countries and a reduction or elimination of registration and marketing authorization fees. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the 10-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 
 Paeditric Exclusivity
 If an applicant obtains a marketing authorization in all EU Member States, or a marketing authorization granted in the centralized procedure by the European Commission, and the study results for the pediatric population are included in the product information, even when negative, the medicine is then eligible for an additional six-month period of qualifying patent protection through extension of the term of the Supplementary Protection Certificate, or SPC.

Regulatory Requirements After a Marketing Authorization has been Obtained 
 In case an authorization for a medicinal product in the EU is obtained, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. These include: 

• | Compliance with the EU’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules must be ensured. These rules can impose post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The manufacturing of authorized medicinal products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the EU with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the EU.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The marketing and promotion of authorized drugs, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the EU notably under Directive 2001/83EC, as amended, and are also subject to EU Member State laws. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is prohibited across the EU.

 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom 
 On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit. Following protracted negotiations, the United Kingdom left the EU on January 31, 2020. Under the withdrawal agreement, there is a transitional period until December 31, 2020 (extendable by up to two years). On December 24, 2020, the United Kingdom and the European Union entered into a Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The agreement sets out certain procedures for approval and recognition of medical products in each jurisdiction. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the UK, as the UK legislation now has the potential to diverge from EU legislation. It remains to be seen how Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the UK in the long-term. The MHRA has recently published detailed guidance for industry and organizations to follow from January 1, 2021 now the transition period is over, which will be updated as the UK’s regulatory position on medicinal products evolves over time.
 Furthermore, while the Data Protection Act of 2018 in the United Kingdom that “implements” and complements the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, has achieved Royal Assent on May 23, 2018 and is now effective in the United Kingdom, it is still unclear whether transfer of data from the European Economic Area, or EEA, to the United Kingdom will remain lawful under GDPR. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement provides for a transitional period during which the United Kingdom will be treated like an European Union member state in relation to processing and transfers of personal data for four months from January 1, 2021.  This may be extended by two further months. After such period, the United Kingdom will be a “third country” under the GDPR unless the European Commission adopts an adequacy decision in respect of transfers of personal data to the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has already determined that it considers all of the EU 27 and EEA member states to be adequate for the purposes of data protection, ensuring that data flows from the United Kingdom to the EU/EEA remain unaffected.
 
General Data Protection Regulation
 
The collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the EU, including personal health data, is subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EU, including the U.S., and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater.  The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR.  
 32


Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance.
 Pricing Decisions for Approved Products 
 In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, EU Member States have the option to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. EU Member States may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other EU Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the EU have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage health care expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the EU. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU Member States, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced EU Member States, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries. 
Human Capital Resources 
 As of February 19, 2021, we had 154 full-time employees, including a total of 62 employees with M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. Of these full-time employees, 106 employees were engaged in research and development and all are located in the U.S. 
 Our employees are our greatest asset and we strive to create a work environment that is inclusive, challenging and fun.  We are committed to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DE&I”) and in 2021 we added a dedicated resource overseeing our efforts in these areas with a commitment to provide awareness training to all employees and support under-represented groups and vendors where possible. We plan to create greater awareness and capability in our organization through leadership accountability and transparency by providing opportunities for employees across the organization to contribute to our DE&I plans, decisions and initiatives. 
 We consider the intellectual capital of our employees to be an essential driver of our business and key to our future prospects and we provide updates to our Board of Directors on our organization on an ongoing basis. Historically we have had employee turnover that is in line with our industry, but the competition for talent remains strong as the number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in the Boston area has increased dramatically in the past three years. Given our financial resources and our track record, we believe that we will continue to be able to fill positions and grow our headcount in support of our expanding pipeline of research and development programs and product candidates and potential commercialization. 
 We are committed to providing our employees with compensation that meets the expectations of the market and industry norms.  We monitor our compensation programs closely using comprehensive industry surveys and data to guide us, and we provide what we consider to be a competitive mix of long and short term incentives including competitive salaries, health and welfare benefits and participation in our equity programs. We regularly review our compensation practices and analyze the equity of our compensation decisions for all employees.  None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a trade or labor union. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 We believe our company culture is one that aims to support each individual fully not just their contribution as an employee.  The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the creation of a more fluid and flexible work environment to allow individuals to meet the needs of themselves and family members while contributing to the success of the company.  In the current virtual world we have moved from regular onsite wellness activities to those that can be enjoyed virtually from meditation and yoga, to access to online tutoring for children learning remotely in addition to more time off for selfcare.
 The health and safety of our onsite employees was a primary focus in 2020 due to the pandemic.  We implemented a series of safeguards following CDC and State recommendations including increased, regular cleaning, social distancing and occupancy limitations, work station barriers, and online scheduling and seating selection along with access to regular COVID-19 testing paid for by the company.  These will remain in place until CDC guidance indicates they are no longer necessary.

Facilities 
 We currently occupy approximately 47,546 square feet of office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts under a lease that originally expired in June 2023. In November 2020, we executed an amendment to update the term of the current lease to terminate 60 days after the commencement date of our new lease.
 In November 2020, we executed a lease in Watertown, Massachusetts (the “new lease”) with ARE-MA Region No. 75, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Landlord”), effective as of November 13, 2020, pursuant to which we will lease approximately 79,155 square feet of office and laboratory space located at 100 Talcott Street in Watertown, Massachusetts (the “New Premises”), which will commence on or around December 24, 2021, with a term of 10 years.
 Scientific Advisory Board 
 We have established a scientific advisory board and we regularly seek advice and input from these leading scientists and physicians on matters related to our research and development programs. The members of our advisory board consist of experts across a range of key disciplines relevant to our programs. Our advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their availability to us. In addition, our advisors may have arrangements with other companies to assist those companies in developing products or technologies that may compete with ours. All of our advisors are affiliated with other entities and devote only a small portion of their time to us. The current members of our scientific advisory board are:
