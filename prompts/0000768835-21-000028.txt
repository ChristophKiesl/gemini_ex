Item 1. Business
The Company
Big Lots, Inc., an Ohio corporation, through its wholly owned subsidiaries is a neighborhood discount retailer operating in the United States (“U.S.”). At January 30, 2021, we operated a total of 1,408 stores and an e-commerce platform. Our mission is to help people live BIG and save LOTS by providing our customers with the right product at the right price. Our vision is to be the BIG difference for a better life by delivering unmatched value through surprise and delight, building a “Best Places to Work” culture, rewarding shareholders with consistent growth and top tier returns, and doing good as we do well. Our values are leading with our core customer (whom we refer to as Jennifer), treating all like friends, succeeding together, and playing to win.
Our principal executive offices are located at 4900 E. Dublin-Granville Road, Columbus, Ohio 43081, and our telephone number is (614) 278‑6800.
Unless this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”) otherwise indicates or the context otherwise requires, the terms the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Big Lots, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
Similar to many other retailers, our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31, which results in some fiscal years being comprised of 52 weeks and some fiscal years being comprised of 53 weeks. Unless otherwise stated, references to years in this Form 10-K relate to fiscal years rather than to calendar years. The following table provides a summary of our fiscal year calendar and the associated number of weeks in each fiscal year:

Fiscal Year | Number of Weeks | Year Begin Date | Year End Date 
2021 | 52 | January 31, 2021 | January 29, 2022
2020 | 52 | February 2, 2020 | January 30, 2021
2019 | 52 | February 3, 2019 | February 1, 2020
2018 | | February 4, 2018 | February 2, 2019
2017 | | January 29, 2017 | February 3, 2018
2016 | 52 | January 31, 2016 | January 28, 2017

We manage our business on the basis of one segment: discount retailing. In 2020, we evaluated and reported overall sales and merchandise performance based on the following key merchandising categories: Furniture; Seasonal; Soft Home; Food; Consumables; Hard Home; and Electronics, Toys, & Accessories. The Furniture category includes our upholstery; mattress; case goods; and ready-to-assemble departments. The Seasonal category includes our lawn & garden; summer; Christmas; and other holiday departments. The Soft Home category includes our fashion bedding; utility bedding; bath; window; decorative textile; home organization; area rugs; home décor; and frames departments. The Food category includes our beverage & grocery; candy & snacks; and specialty foods departments. The Consumables category includes our health, beauty and cosmetics; plastics; paper; chemical; and pet departments. The Hard Home category includes our small appliances; table top; food preparation; stationery; and home maintenance departments. The Electronics, Toys, & Accessories category includes our electronics; toys; jewelry; apparel; and hosiery departments.
Merchandising
We focus our merchandising strategy on (1) being the authority on price and value to Jennifer in all of our merchandise categories and (2) surprising and delighting Jennifer with our product assortment. We utilize traditional sourcing methods and in certain merchandise categories, we also take advantage of closeout channels to enhance our ability to offer outstanding value and bring surprise and delight into our product offerings. We evaluate our product offerings to ensure we are providing quality and value. This process requires us to focus our product offering decisions on our customer’s expectations and enables us to compare the potential performance of traditionally-sourced merchandise, either domestic or import, to closeout merchandise, which is generally sourced from production overruns, packaging changes, discontinued products, order cancellations, liquidations, returns, and other disruptions in the supply chain of manufacturers. We believe that focusing on our customers’ expectations has improved our ability to provide a desirable assortment of offerings in our merchandise categories.
Table of  Contents

We source our merchandise through both closeout opportunities and planned purchases to provide Jennifer with the novelty of closeouts and the consistency of staple product offerings. Our planned purchases in the Food, Consumables, Soft Home, and Furniture merchandise categories provide a merchandise assortment that our customers expect us to consistently offer in our stores at a significant value. Over the last two years, we have focused on increasing our sourcing and purchasing of quality closeout merchandise directly from manufacturers and other vendors, typically at prices lower than those paid by traditional discount retailers. We believe that our strong vendor relationships and our strong credit profile support this sourcing model. We expect that the unpredictability of the retail and manufacturing environments coupled with what we believe is our significant purchasing power position will continue to support our ability to source quality closeout merchandise at competitive prices. As a result of our renewed focus on closeouts, our 2020 closeout-related net sales increased by approximately 37% compared to 2019.
Our global sourcing department and overseas vendor relationships represent important components of our merchandising strategy. We expect our import partners to responsibly source goods that our merchandising teams identify as having our desired mix of quality, fashion, and value. During 2020, we purchased approximately 21% of our merchandise, at cost, directly from overseas vendors, including approximately 13% from vendors located in China. Additionally, a significant amount of our domestically-purchased merchandise is manufactured abroad. As a result, a significant portion of our merchandise supply is subject to certain risks described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.
Advertising and Promotion
Our brand image is an important part of our marketing program. We use a variety of marketing vehicles to promote our brand awareness, including television, internet, social media, e-mail, in-store point-of-purchase, and print media.
Over the past few years, we have refined our brand identity to accentuate our friendly service and community orientation. We focus on serving Jennifer with a friendly approach and an easy, positive shopping experience. We believe our approach to retailing differentiates us from the competition and allows us to make a difference in the communities we serve. Our community-oriented approach to retailing includes “doing good as we do well,” which means supporting both local and national causes that aid the communities in which we do business. In our local markets, we invest in point of sale campaigns in each of our geographic regions, the beneficiaries of which are selected based on their impacts on local customers and associates. We serve the community on a national level through our Big Lots Foundation, which focuses on healthcare, housing, hunger, and education. In addition, we are pleased to support our local community in Columbus, OH through our partnership with Nationwide Children’s Hospital, to which the Company committed $40 million and the Big Lots Foundation committed additional funds to open the Big Lots Behavioral Health Pavilion, a state-of-the-art medical facility dedicated to child and adolescent mental and behavioral health.
In all of our markets, we design and distribute printed advertising circulars, through newspaper insertions and mailings. In 2020, we distributed multi-page circulars representing 23 weeks of advertising coverage, compared to 29 circulars in 2019. We create regional versions of these circulars to tailor our advertising message based on market differences caused by product availability, climate, and customer preferences. 
Our customer database is an important marketing tool that allows us to communicate in a cost-effective manner with our customers, including through e-mail delivery of our circulars, announcement of flash sales, and product-specific promotions. In addition, our BIG Rewards program rewards our customers for making frequent and high-ticket purchases and offers a special birthday reward. We utilize insights gained through the BIG Rewards program to evaluate the effectiveness of our promotions and tailor promotions to our customers’ desires. At January 30, 2021, our BIG Rewards program included nearly 21 million active members who had made a purchase in our stores in the last 12 months.
In 2020, we substantially increased our investment in social media marketing and digital media marketing, which includes Facebook®, Instagram®, Twitter®, Pinterest®, and YouTube®. Our marketing program also employs a traditional television campaign, which combines strategic branding and promotional elements used in most of our other marketing media. Our highly-targeted media placement strategy uses strategically selected networks and programs aired by national cable providers as the foundation of our television advertising. In addition, we use in-store promotional materials, including in-store signage, to emphasize special bargains and significant values offered to our customers. Total advertising expense as a percentage of total net sales was 1.7%, 1.8%, and 1.8% in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.

Competition
We operate in the highly competitive retail industry. We face strong sales competition from other general merchandise, discount, food, furniture, arts and crafts, and dollar store retailers, which operate in traditional brick and mortar stores and/or online. Additionally, we compete with a number of companies for retail site locations, to attract and retain quality employees, and to acquire our broad merchandising assortment from vendors. We operate an e-commerce platform which faces additional competition from a wider range of retailers in a highly competitive marketplace, where we compete for customers, fulfillment capabilities, and technological innovation.

Warehouse and Distribution
The majority of our merchandise offerings are processed for retail sale and distributed to our stores from five regional distribution centers located in Alabama, California, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania. 
We select the locations of our distribution centers to help manage transportation costs and to minimize the distance from our distribution centers to our stores. While certain of our merchandise vendors deliver directly to our stores, the large majority of our inventory is staged and delivered from our distribution centers to facilitate prompt and efficient distribution and transportation of merchandise to our stores and help maximize our sales and inventory turnover.
In addition to our regional distribution centers that handle store merchandise, we operate two warehouses within our Ohio distribution center. One warehouse distributes fixtures and supplies to our stores and our five regional distribution centers and the other warehouse supplements our fulfillment center for our e-commerce operations. In 2020, to supplement our e-commerce fulfillment center, we began fulfilling direct-ship e-commerce orders from 47 of our store locations, which we strategically selected based on geographic location, size, and other relevant factors. We continue to evaluate our e-commerce fulfillment capabilities to reduce shipping times.
In 2021, we intend to expand our distribution network by opening two small-format distribution centers, which will be operated by a third party, to increase the efficiency and capacity of our supply chain, and support future growth. These small-format distribution centers will process full-pallet shipments and other bulky items, particularly furniture, which will allow our regional distribution centers to focus on standard carton processing.
For additional information regarding our warehouses and distribution facilities and related initiatives, see the discussion under the caption “Warehouse and Distribution” in “Item 2. Properties” of this Form 10-K.

Seasonality
We have historically experienced seasonal fluctuations in our sales and profitability, with a larger percentage of our net sales and operating profit realized in our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the Christmas holiday selling season. In addition, our quarterly net sales and operating profits can be affected by the timing of new store openings and store closings, advertising, and certain holidays. We historically receive a higher proportion of merchandise, carry higher inventory levels, and incur higher outbound shipping and payroll expenses as a percentage of sales in our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of increased sales activity during our fourth fiscal quarter. Performance during our fourth fiscal quarter typically reflects a leveraging effect which has a favorable impact on our operating results because net sales are higher and certain of our costs, such as rent and depreciation, are fixed and do not vary as sales levels escalate. If our sales performance is significantly better or worse during the Christmas holiday selling season, we would expect a more pronounced impact on our annual financial results than if our sales performance is significantly better or worse in a different season. Our net sales as a percentage of full year in the second quarter of 2020 were disproportionately higher as a result of increased demand arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the demand volatility we have experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, the seasonality of our 2021 results may also differ from historical experience.
The following table sets forth the seasonality of net sales and operating profit (loss) for 2020, 2019, and 2018 by fiscal quarter:

 | First | Second | Third | Fourth
Fiscal Year 2020 | | | | 
Net sales as a percentage of full year | 23.2 | % | 26.5 | % | 22.2 | % | 28.1 | %
Operating profit as a percentage of full year (a) | 8.7 | | 71.0 | | 5.0 | | 15.3 | 
Fiscal Year 2019 | | | | 
Net sales as a percentage of full year | 24.3 | % | 23.5 | % | 21.9 | % | 30.3 | %
Operating profit as a percentage of full year (b) | 7.7 | | 3.9 | | 50.9 | | 37.5 | 
Fiscal Year 2018 | | | | 
Net sales as a percentage of full year | 24.2 | % | 23.3 | % | 22.0 | % | 30.5 | %
Operating profit (loss) as a percentage of full year | 20.8 | | 15.7 | | (4.4) | | 67.9 | 

(a) The second quarter of 2020 included a gain on sale of distribution centers and related expenses of $459.1 million related to the sale and leaseback of four distribution centers, which significantly increased second quarter operating profit as a percentage of full year in comparison to 2019 and 2018.
(b) The third quarter of 2019 included a gain on sale of distribution center of $178.5 million, which significantly increased third quarter operating profit as a percentage of full year in comparison to 2018 and 2020.
Human Capital
At January 30, 2021, we had approximately 37,000 active associates comprised of 10,800 full-time and 26,200 part‑time associates. Approximately 71% of the associates we employed during 2020 were employed on a part-time basis. Temporary associates hired for the holiday selling season increased the total number of associates to a peak of approximately 39,100 in 2020. We are not a party to any labor agreements. We require all of our associates to adhere to our code of ethics and workplace safety protocols.
We believe our associates are among our most important resources. We evaluate our human capital management at our stores, distribution centers, and corporate headquarters on the basis of associate engagement, diversity, equity, and inclusion, compensation and benefits, and talent development. 
Associate Engagement
We send an associate engagement survey to each of the associates in our corporate headquarters and to our field and distribution center leadership on an annual basis to assess our associate engagement and ask those associates their thoughts on manager effectiveness, performance enablement, and our diversity and inclusion efforts. In 2020, 93% of the associates surveyed responded to the survey with an 82% favorable engagement rate. Based on results of the annual survey, our leaders create action plans to address areas where our associates have told us we can improve.

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
We recognize the value of creating a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace. As a result, diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) is a significant component of our human capital management. In 2020, we established our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Council (“DEI Council”), which is comprised of associates from our stores, distribution centers, and corporate headquarters who represent various job levels, locations, ages, genders, languages, work shifts, races, sexual orientations, and leadership styles. The DEI Council’s mission is to lead the development and advancement of our DEI strategy. Additionally, we formed a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Executive Advisory Committee, which is comprised of senior leaders who provide guidance to the DEI Council, as well as approve our DEI strategy and promote its achievement throughout our organization. In 2021, our DEI strategy for human capital includes, among other things, a focus on recruitment and development of diverse talent, conscious inclusion training, and policy review to prevent bias.
Compensation and Benefits
We offer a competitive compensation and benefits package to our eligible associates including, among other benefits, incentive compensation, performance-based merit pay, paid holidays, paid vacation, 401(k) match, and healthcare coverage, including medical, dental, and vision insurance with health savings account and flexible savings account options. Our compensation and benefits packages are designed to attract and retain high-performing talent. Additionally, we provide our associates with a company discount on our merchandise and our associates redeemed approximately $37 million in corporate discounts in 2020.
Talent Development
Talent development is critical to developing the high-performance culture that we seek to foster. Each of our associates participates in an annual goal-setting process and completes an annual performance review, which is followed by periodic discussions throughout the year to assess progress. Each of our managers also completes an individual development plan on an annual basis to set and track long-term goals. Additionally, our business leaders participate in a succession planning process that serves as a tool for identifying and developing high-potential individuals within our organization as well as ensuring business continuity. We also offer a robust catalog of training and development programs to our associates through our Big Lots University training tool, which covers topics including, but not limited to, workplace harassment, safety, ethics, and job skills.
COVID-19 Response
One of our key business goals during 2020 was to ensure the safety and well-being of our associates during the COVID-19 pandemic. To provide a safe working environment for our associates and our customers, we increased sanitation protocols, secured personal protective equipment for our associates, installed plexiglass at all registers, implemented social distancing and mask protocols at our stores and distribution centers, and implemented daily health screens and temperature checks for all associates. From March 2020 through July 2020, we also provided our non-exempt store and distribution center associates with a $2 per hour wage increase and, in the second quarter of 2020, we made additional bonus payments to our associates. In 2020, we spent more than $50 million on these and other COVID-19 related response efforts.
