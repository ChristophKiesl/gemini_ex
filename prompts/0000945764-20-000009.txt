Item 1. Business and Properties
GENERAL
Denbury Resources Inc., a Delaware corporation, is an independent oil and natural gas company with 230.2 MMBOE of estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2019, of which 98% is oil.  Our operations are focused in two key operating areas: the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions.  Our goal is to increase the value of our properties through a combination of exploitation, drilling and proven engineering extraction practices, with the most significant emphasis relating to CO2 enhanced oil recovery operations.
As part of our corporate strategy, we are committed to strong financial discipline, efficient operations and creating long-term value for our shareholders through the following key principles:

• | target specific regions where we either have, or believe we can create, a competitive advantage as a result of our ownership or use of CO2 reserves, oil fields and CO2 infrastructure;


• | secure properties where we believe additional value can be created through tertiary recovery operations and a combination of other exploitation, development, exploration and marketing techniques;


• | acquire properties that give us a majority working interest and operational control or where we believe we can ultimately obtain it;


• | maximize the value and cash flow generated from our operations by increasing production and reserves while controlling costs;


• | optimize the timing and allocation of capital among our investment opportunities to maximize the rates of return on our investments;


• | exercise financial discipline by attempting to balance our development capital expenditures with our cash flows from operations; and


• | attract and maintain a highly competitive team of experienced and incentivized personnel.

Denbury has been publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange since 1997. Our corporate headquarters is located at 5320 Legacy Drive, Plano, Texas 75024, and our phone number is 972-673-2000. At December 31, 2019, we had 806 employees, 451 of whom were employed in field operations or at our field offices.  We make our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, available free of charge on or through our website, www.denbury.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.  The SEC also maintains a website, http://www.sec.gov, which contains periodic reports on Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC, along with other reports, proxy and information statements and other information filed by Denbury.  Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”) we use the terms “Denbury,” “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” to refer to Denbury Resources Inc. and, as the context may require, its subsidiaries.
2019 BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS
Since our production is 97% oil, oil prices generally constitute the single largest variable in our operating results. Over the last several years, NYMEX oil prices have been extremely volatile, decreasing to a low of $26 in early 2016 and gradually improving to hit a three-year peak of $76 in October 2018, before retreating to the low $40s in late December 2018 and generally averaging in the low $50s to mid $60s range throughout 2019. Throughout this time, we have focused primarily on preservation of cash and liquidity, together with cost reductions and debt management, rather than concentration on expansion and growth. Our 2019 key accomplishments and business developments included the following:

• | Generated $494.1 million of cash flow from operations ($408.8 million after reducing for interest payments treated as debt reduction), significantly exceeding our $273.6 million of incurred development capital expenditures and capitalized interest in 2019.


• | Reduced our debt principal by $250.5 million and significantly improved our debt maturity profile, ending the year with no outstanding borrowings on the Company’s senior secured bank credit facility.

Denbury Resources Inc.


• | Continued progress on the CO2 enhanced oil recovery development project at Cedar Creek Anticline (“CCA”), Denbury’s largest oil field, to access the potential for significant long-term oil production and cash flow from this key asset, with project activities and capital primarily related to procurement of the pipe and preparation for installation of the CO2 pipeline to CCA.


• | Improved our leverage ratio to 3.7x during 2019 from 4.2x during 2018 (ratio of net debt (debt principal less cash) to Adjusted EBITDAX (a non-GAAP measure)) (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations).


• | Reduced general and administrative expenses (excluding $18.6 million of severance expense related to a voluntary separation program) by $7.1 million, a 10% reduction from 2018 amounts.


• | Continued to optimize our oil and natural gas asset portfolio through the following: (1) sold Citronelle Field for approximately $10 million in July 2019 and (2) entered into an agreement in December 2019 to sell half of our nearly 100% working interests in four conventional southeast Texas oil fields for $50 million and a carried interest in ten wells to be funded and drilled by the purchaser, which is currently expected to occur in March 2020 (the “Pending Gulf Coast Working Interests Sale”).


• | Continued the monetization of valuable surface land with no active oil and natural gas operations around Houston, Texas, including (1) the sale of multiple parcels primarily around Houston, Texas in transactions totaling $14 million in 2019 and (2) entered into a contract to sell acreage around Houston, Texas for $32 million which provides for a substantial portion of the cash proceeds from such sale to be received no later than mid-2021 with the remaining portion of cash proceeds to be received by mid-2022, subject to certain conditions. We are actively working with the buyer to potentially close the first portion of this sale before the end of 2020. 

2020 BUSINESS OUTLOOK
Since the beginning of 2020, NYMEX oil prices have moved downward by over $10 per barrel (from the low $60s per barrel in early January to around $50 per barrel in mid-February 2020), due in part to concerns about the COVID-19 coronavirus and its real and potential impact on near-term worldwide oil demand. In consideration of the current oil price environment and the Company’s desire to preserve ongoing liquidity, we have set our 2020 base capital budget at between $175 million and $185 million (excluding capitalized interest), which includes $10 million of capital dedicated to continuing near-term CO2 development activities at CCA as further discussed below. This 2020 base capital budget is a $57 million (24%) reduction from our 2019 capital expenditure level. We currently anticipate that our 2020 base capital budget of $175 million to $185 million will be more than fully funded with cash flow from operations (assuming a $50 per barrel NYMEX oil price) and should result in the Company generating upwards of $100 million of cash in excess of our capital expenditures, without including any proceeds from the Pending Gulf Coast Working Interests Sale (from which we expect net proceeds of approximately $40 million) or the impact of any other potential transactions.
An additional $140 million to $150 million of capital for the CCA CO2 tertiary flood development, most of which is scheduled to be spent in the second half of the year, is conditioned upon future Board approval. The aggregate $155 million of planned 2020 CCA tertiary-related development capital consists of $105 million for the 105-mile extension of the Greencore Pipeline to CCA, with the remainder dedicated to facilities, well work and field development. The Company currently anticipates finalizing its 2020 capital plans related to CCA during the second quarter.
Based on our capital spending plans, we currently anticipate 2020 average daily production to be between 53,000 and 56,000 BOE/d, after adjusting for the Pending Gulf Coast Working Interests Sale (see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Overview – Pending Sale of Working Interests in Certain Texas Fields). The production associated with the Pending Gulf Coast Working Interests Sale averaged 1,170 BOE/d during the fourth quarter of 2019. Our anticipated 2020 production level compares to 2019 average continuing production of 56,914 BOE/d, after reduction for 2019 property divestitures and production associated with the Pending Gulf Coast Working Interests Sale.
The Company is currently assessing various alternatives to improve the Company’s balance sheet and may engage in debt reduction and/or maturity extension transactions of various types, primarily focusing on our second lien debt maturing in 2021 and 2022, plus accessing the capital markets and/or generating capital from joint ventures or asset sales. In addition, we continue to market for sale surface land with no active oil and gas operations in the Houston area and believe future land sales could generate an additional $30 million to $50 million of cash over the next few years beyond the $52 million we currently have under contract or have sold.

ESTIMATED NET QUANTITIES OF PROVED OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES AND PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE NET REVENUES
Oil and Natural Gas Reserve Estimates
DeGolyer and MacNaughton (“D&M”) prepared estimates of our net proved oil and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (see the summary of D&M’s report as of December 31, 2019, included as an exhibit to this Form 10-K). These estimates of reserves were prepared using an average price equal to the unweighted arithmetic average of hydrocarbon prices on the first day of each month within the 12-month period in accordance with rules and regulations of the SEC.  These oil and natural gas reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist, nor do they include any value for undeveloped acreage.  The reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties.
The following table provides estimated proved reserve information prepared by D&M as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, as well as PV-10 Values and Standardized Measures for each period. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and their values, including many factors beyond our control, which are further discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors – Estimating our reserves, production and future net cash flows is difficult to do with any certainty.  See also Oil and Natural Gas Operations – Field Summary Table and Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Disclosures (Unaudited) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of reserve inputs and changes between periods.

(1) | The reference prices were based on the arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month NYMEX commodity prices for each month during the respective year. These prices do not reflect adjustments for market differentials by field that are utilized in the preparation of our reserve report to arrive at the appropriate net price we receive. See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations – Operating Results Table for details of oil and natural gas prices received, both including and excluding the impact of derivative settlements. 


(2) | Determined based on the average first-day-of-the-month prices for each month, adjusted to prices received by field in accordance with standards set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board Codification (“FASC”). PV-10 Values and the Standardized Measure are significantly impacted by the oil prices we receive relative to NYMEX oil prices (our NYMEX oil price differential). The weighted-average oil price differentials utilized were $0.14 per Bbl below representative NYMEX oil prices as of December 31, 2019, compared to $0.24 per Bbl below NYMEX oil prices as of December 31, 2018, and $2.25 per Bbl below NYMEX oil prices as of December 31, 2017. 


(3) | PV-10 Value is a non-GAAP measure and is different from the Standardized Measure in that PV-10 Value is a pre-tax number and the Standardized Measure is an after-tax number. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations for further discussion. 

Our proved developed non-producing reserves primarily consist of (1) reserves within a proved tertiary flood in areas that have not yet experienced a response from CO2 injection, (2) reserves that will be recovered from currently productive zones utilizing minor modifications to manage the flow of CO2 or water within the reservoir, and (3) reserves that will be recovered through recompletions to other intervals above or below the currently producing interval.
As of December 31, 2019, our estimated proved undeveloped reserves totaled approximately 23.3 MMBOE, or approximately 10% of our estimated total proved reserves.  Approximately 85% (19.8 MMBOE) of our proved undeveloped oil reserves relate to planned future development within our CO2 tertiary operating fields.  We generally consider the CO2 tertiary proved undeveloped reserves to be lower risk than other proved undeveloped reserves that require drilling at locations offsetting existing production, because all of these proved undeveloped reserves are associated with tertiary recovery operations in fields and reservoirs that historically produced substantial volumes of oil under primary production. As of December 31, 2019, 16.1 MMBOE of our total proved undeveloped reserves are not scheduled to be developed within five years of initial booking, all of which are part of CO2 EOR projects. We believe these reserves satisfy the conditions to be included as proved reserves because (1) we have established and continue to follow the previously adopted development plan for each of these projects; (2) we have significant ongoing development activities in each of these CO2 EOR projects and (3) we have a historical record of completing the development of comparable long-term projects.
Our proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2019 were 9.0 MMBOE (28%) lower than at December 31, 2018. During 2019, we spent approximately $50 million to convert 9.5 MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves, primarily related to continued tertiary development activities at Bell Creek and East Heidelberg fields. Other changes in proved undeveloped reserves during 2019 included adding an additional 2.7 MMBOE primarily related to our tertiary operations at Oyster Bayou and Brookhaven fields and recognizing net downward revisions of our proved undeveloped reserves of 2.2 MMBOE, primarily the result of reserves that were reclassified to unproved based on changes in our waterflood development plans that would now extend beyond the five-year development timeframe.
During 2019, we provided oil and natural gas reserve estimates for 2018 to the United States Energy Information Agency that were substantially the same as the reserve estimates included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Internal Controls Over Reserve Estimates
Reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by D&M, an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm located in Dallas, Texas, utilizing data provided by our internal reservoir engineering team and is the responsibility of management. We rely on D&M’s expertise to ensure that our reserve estimates are prepared in compliance with SEC rules and regulations and that appropriate geologic, petroleum engineering, and evaluation principles and techniques are applied in accordance with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry as presented in the publication of the Society of Petroleum Engineers entitled “Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (Revision as of February 19, 2007)”.  The person responsible for the preparation of the reserve report is a Senior Vice President at D&M; he is a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas. He received a Master of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from the University

Denbury Resources Inc.

of Texas in 1984, and he has in excess of 35 years of experience in oil and gas reservoir studies and evaluations.  Our Senior Vice President – Business Development and Technology is primarily responsible for overseeing the independent petroleum engineering firm during the process.  Our Senior Vice President – Business Development and Technology has a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from the Colorado School of Mines and over 35 years of industry experience working with petroleum engineering and reserve estimates.  D&M relies on various data provided by our internal reservoir engineering team in preparing its reserve estimates, including such items as oil and natural gas prices, ownership interests, production information, operating costs, planned capital expenditures and other technical data. Our internal reservoir engineering team consists of qualified petroleum engineers who maintain the Company’s internal evaluation of reserves and compare the Company’s information to the reserves prepared by D&M. Management is responsible for designing the internal control procedures used in the preparation of our oil and gas reserves, which include verification of data input into reserve forecasting and economics evaluation software, as well as multi-discipline management reviews.  The internal reservoir engineering team reports directly to our Senior Vice President – Business Development and Technology.  In addition, our Board of Directors’ Reserves and Health, Safety and Environmental (“HSE”) Committee, on behalf of the Board of Directors, oversees the qualifications, independence, performance and hiring of our independent petroleum engineering firm and reviews the final report and subsequent reporting of our oil and natural gas reserve estimates.  The Chairman of the Reserves and HSE Committee holds a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and bachelor’s degrees in Chemistry and Mathematics from Capital University in Ohio. He has more than 35 years of industry experience, with responsibilities including reserves preparation and approval.
OIL AND NATURAL GAS OPERATIONS
Summary. Our oil and natural gas properties are concentrated in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  Currently our properties with proved and producing reserves in the Gulf Coast region are situated in Mississippi, Texas, and Louisiana, and in the Rocky Mountain region are situated in Montana, North Dakota and Wyoming. Our primary focus is increasing the value of our properties through a combination of exploitation, drilling and proven engineering extraction practices, with the most significant emphasis relating to CO2 EOR operations. Our current portfolio of CO2 EOR projects provides us significant oil production and reserve growth potential in the future, assuming crude oil prices are at levels that support the development of those projects.
We have been conducting and expanding EOR operations on our assets in the Gulf Coast region since 1999, and as a result, we currently have many more CO2 EOR projects in this region than in the Rocky Mountain region. We began operations in the Rocky Mountain region in 2010 in connection with, and following, our merger with Encore Acquisition Company (“Encore”). In 2012, as part of a significant sale and exchange transaction with Exxon Mobil Corporation (“ExxonMobil”), we sold to ExxonMobil our Bakken area assets in North Dakota and Montana in exchange for (1) $1.3 billion in cash, (2) operating interests in Hartzog Draw and Webster fields in Wyoming and Texas, respectively, and (3) an overriding royalty interest equivalent to an approximate one-third ownership interest in ExxonMobil’s CO2 reserves in LaBarge Field in Wyoming (the “Bakken Exchange Transaction”). In the Gulf Coast region, we own what is, to our knowledge, the region’s only significant naturally occurring source of CO2, and these large volumes of naturally occurring CO2 give us a significant competitive advantage in this area. In addition to this naturally occurring CO2 source, we utilize CO2 captured from industrial sources which would otherwise be released into the atmosphere (sometimes referred to as anthropogenic, man-made or industrial-source CO2) in our tertiary operations, including CO2 from the LaBarge Field in Wyoming, which is captured in conjunction with processing helium from the LaBarge Field gas stream at ExxonMobil’s Shute Creek gas plant. These industrial sources of CO2 help us recover additional oil from mature oil fields and, we believe, also provide an economical way to reduce atmospheric CO2 emissions through the associated underground storage of CO2 which incidentally occurs as part of our oil-producing EOR operations.

Enhanced Oil Recovery Overview. CO2 used in EOR is one of the most efficient tertiary recovery mechanisms for producing crude oil.  When injected under pressure into underground, oil-bearing rock formations, CO2 acts somewhat like a solvent as it travels through the reservoir rock, mixing with and modifying the characteristics of the oil so it can be produced and sold.  The terms “tertiary flood,” “CO2 flood” and “CO2 EOR” are used interchangeably throughout this document.
While enhanced oil recovery projects utilizing CO2 have been successfully performed by numerous oil and gas companies in a wide range of oil-bearing reservoirs in different oil-producing basins, we believe our investments, experience and acquired knowledge give us a strategic and competitive advantage in the areas in which we operate. We apply what we have learned and developed over the years to improve and increase sweep efficiency within the CO2 EOR projects we operate.
We began our CO2 operations in August 1999, when we acquired Little Creek Field, followed by our acquisition of Jackson Dome CO2 reserves and the NEJD pipeline in 2001.  Based upon our success at Little Creek and the ownership of the CO2 reserves, we began to transition our capital spending and acquisition efforts to focus more heavily on CO2 EOR and, over time, transformed our strategy to focus primarily on owning and operating oil fields that are well suited for CO2 EOR projects. Prior to tertiary flooding, we strive to maximize the currently sizeable primary and secondary production from our prospective tertiary fields and from fields in which tertiary floods have commenced but still contain significant non-tertiary production.  Our asset base today almost entirely consists of, or otherwise relates to, oil fields that we are currently flooding with CO2 or plan to flood with CO2 in the future, or assets that produce CO2.
Our tertiary operations have grown so that (1) 60% of our proved reserves at December 31, 2019 are proved tertiary oil reserves; (2) 64% of our 2019 total production was related to tertiary oil operations (on a BOE basis); and (3) 63% of our 2019 capital expenditures (excluding acquisitions) were related to our tertiary oil operations.  At year-end 2019, the proved oil reserves in our tertiary recovery oil fields had an estimated PV-10 Value of approximately $1.8 billion, or 69% of our total PV-10 Value.  In addition, there are significant probable and possible reserves at several other fields for which tertiary operations are underway or planned.
Although the up-front cost of tertiary production infrastructure and time to construct pipelines and production facilities is greater than in primary oil recovery in most circumstances, we believe tertiary recovery has several favorable, offsetting and unique attributes, including (1) a lower exploration risk, as we are operating oil fields that have significant historical production and reservoir and geological data, (2) lower production decline rates than unconventional development, (3) reasonable return metrics at our anticipated long-term prices, (4) limited competition for this recovery method in our geographic regions and a strategic advantage due to our ownership of the CO2 reserves and CO2 pipeline infrastructure, (5) our EOR operations are generally less disruptive to new habitats in comparison to other oil and natural gas development because we further develop existing (as opposed to new) oil fields, and (6) through our oil-producing EOR operations, we concurrently store CO2 captured from industrial sources in the same underground formations that previously trapped and stored oil and natural gas.
Tertiary Oil Properties
Gulf Coast Region
CO2 Sources and Pipelines
Jackson Dome.  Our primary Gulf Coast CO2 source, Jackson Dome, located near Jackson, Mississippi, was discovered during the 1970s by oil and gas companies that were exploring for hydrocarbons.  This large and relatively pure source of naturally occurring CO2 (98% CO2) is, to our knowledge, the only significant underground deposit of CO2 in the United States east of the Mississippi River. Together with the related CO2 pipeline infrastructure, Jackson Dome provides us a significant strategic advantage in the acquisition of properties in Mississippi, Louisiana and southeastern Texas that are well suited for CO2 EOR.

Denbury Resources Inc.

We acquired Jackson Dome in February 2001 in a purchase that also gave us ownership and control of the NEJD CO2 pipeline and provided us with a reliable supply of CO2 at a reasonable and predictable cost for our Gulf Coast CO2 tertiary recovery operations.  Since February 2001, we have acquired and drilled numerous CO2-producing wells, significantly increasing our estimated proved Gulf Coast CO2 reserves from approximately 800 Bcf at the time of acquisition of Jackson Dome to approximately 4.8 Tcf as of December 31, 2019.  The proved CO2 reserve estimates are based on a gross (8/8ths) basis, of which our net revenue interest is approximately 3.8 Tcf, and is included in the evaluation of proved CO2 reserves prepared by D&M, an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm.  In discussing our available CO2 reserves, we make reference to the gross amount of proved and probable reserves, as this is the amount that is available both for our own tertiary recovery programs and for industrial users who are customers of Denbury and others, as we are responsible for distributing the entire CO2 production stream.
In addition to our proved reserves, we estimate that we have 910.1 Bcf, on a gross (8/8ths) basis, of probable CO2 reserves at Jackson Dome.  While the majority of these probable reserves are located in structures that have been drilled and tested, such reserves are still considered probable reserves because (1) the original well is plugged; (2) they are located in fault blocks that are immediately adjacent to fault blocks with proved reserves; or (3) they are reserves associated with increasing the ultimate recovery factor from our existing reservoirs with proved reserves. In addition, a significant portion of these probable reserves at Jackson Dome are located in undrilled structures where we have sufficient subsurface and seismic data indicating geophysical attributes that, coupled with our historically high drilling success rate, provide a reasonably high degree of certainty that CO2 is present.
In addition to our drilling at Jackson Dome, we have the capability to expand our processing and dehydration capacities and install additional pipelines and/or pumping stations necessary to transport the CO2 through our controlled pipeline network. We expect our current proved reserves of CO2, coupled with a risked drilling program at Jackson Dome and CO2 expected to be captured from industrial sources, to provide sufficient quantities of CO2 for us to develop our proved and probable EOR reserves in the Gulf Coast region. In the future, we believe that once a CO2 flood in a field reaches its productive economic limit, we could recycle a portion of the CO2 that remains in that field’s reservoir and utilize it for oil production in another field’s tertiary flood.
In the Gulf Coast region, approximately 84% of our average daily CO2 produced from Jackson Dome or captured from industrial sources in 2019 was used in our tertiary recovery operations, compared to 83% in 2018 and 87% in 2017, with the balance delivered to third-party industrial users. During 2019, we used an average of 511 MMcf/d of CO2 (including CO2 captured from industrial sources) for our tertiary activities.
Gulf Coast CO2 Captured from Industrial Sources.  In addition to our natural source of CO2, we are currently party to two long-term contracts to purchase CO2 from industrial plants.  We have purchased CO2 from an industrial facility in Port Arthur, Texas since 2012 and from an industrial facility in Geismar, Louisiana since 2013, which supplied an average of approximately 53 MMcf/d of CO2 to our EOR operations during 2019.  Additionally, we are in ongoing discussions with other parties regarding plans to construct plants near the Green Pipeline. In order to capture such volumes, we (or the plant owner) would need to install additional equipment, which includes, at a minimum, compression and dehydration facilities.
Gulf Coast CO2 Pipelines. We acquired the 183-mile NEJD CO2 pipeline that runs from Jackson Dome to near Donaldsonville, Louisiana, as part of the 2001 acquisition of our Jackson Dome CO2 source.  Since 2001, we have acquired or constructed nearly 750 miles of CO2 pipelines, and as of December 31, 2019, we have access to nearly 925 miles of CO2 pipelines, which gives us the ability to deliver CO2 throughout the Gulf Coast region.  In addition to the NEJD CO2 pipeline, the major pipelines in the Gulf Coast region are the Free State Pipeline (90 miles), Delta Pipeline (110 miles), Green Pipeline Texas (120 miles), and Green Pipeline Louisiana (200 miles).
Completion of the Green Pipeline allowed for the first CO2 injection into Hastings Field, located near Houston, Texas, in 2010, and gives us the ability to deliver CO2 to oil fields all along the Gulf Coast from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to Alvin, Texas.  At the present time, most of the CO2 flowing in the Green Pipeline is delivered from the Jackson Dome area, but also includes the CO2 we are receiving from the industrial facilities in Port Arthur, Texas and Geismar, Louisiana, and we are currently transporting a third party’s CO2 for a fee to the sales point at Hastings Field.  We currently have ample capacity within the Green Pipeline to handle additional volumes that may be required to develop our inventory of CO2 EOR projects in this area.
Tertiary Properties with Tertiary Production and Proved Tertiary Reserves at December 31, 2019
Delhi Field. Delhi Field is located east of Monroe, Louisiana.  In May 2006, we purchased our initial interest in Delhi for $50 million.  We began well and facility development in 2008, began delivering CO2 to the field in 2009 via the Delta Pipeline, 
 12

Denbury Resources Inc.

which runs from Tinsley Field to Delhi Field, and first tertiary production occurred at Delhi Field in 2010.  During 2016, we completed construction of a natural gas liquids extraction plant, which provides us with the ability to sell natural gas liquids from the produced stream, improve the efficiency of the CO2 flood, and utilize extracted methane to power the plant and reduce field operating expenses. Production from Delhi Field in the fourth quarter of 2019 averaged 4,085 Bbls/d, compared to 4,526 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2018.  During 2020, we plan to perform conformance work at Delhi Field.
Hastings Field.  Hastings Field is located south of Houston, Texas.  We acquired a majority interest in this field in February 2009 for $247 million.  We initiated CO2 injection in the West Hastings Unit during 2010 upon completion of the construction of the Green Pipeline.  Due to the large vertical oil column that exists in the field, we are developing the Frio reservoir using dedicated CO2 injection and producing wells for each of the major sand intervals. We began producing oil from our EOR operations at Hastings Field in 2012, and we booked initial proved tertiary reserves for the West Hastings Unit in 2012.  The Company also has future plans for continued tertiary development of existing proved undeveloped reserves at the field. During the fourth quarter of 2019, tertiary production from Hastings Field averaged 5,097 Bbls/d, compared to 5,480 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Heidelberg Field.  Heidelberg Field is located in Mississippi off of the Free State Pipeline and consists of an East Unit and a West Unit.  Construction of the CO2 facility, connecting pipeline and well work commenced on the West Heidelberg Unit during 2008, with our first CO2 injections into the Eutaw zone.  Our first tertiary oil production occurred in 2009, and we began flooding the Christmas and Tuscaloosa zones in 2013 and 2014, respectively.  During 2019, we expanded our tertiary flood of the Christmas zone and invested in non-tertiary behind pipe projects. During the fourth quarter of 2019, tertiary production at Heidelberg Field averaged 4,409 Bbls/d, compared to 4,269 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our 2020 development plans for Heidelberg Field include conformance work, with future plans for continued tertiary development of existing proved undeveloped reserves at the field. 
Oyster Bayou Field.  We acquired a majority interest in Oyster Bayou Field in 2007. The field is located in southeast Texas, east of Galveston Bay, and is somewhat unique when compared to our other CO2 EOR projects because the field covers a relatively small area of 3,912 acres. We began CO2 injections into Oyster Bayou Field in 2010, commenced tertiary production in 2011 from the Frio A-1 zone, and booked initial proved tertiary reserves for the field in 2012.  In 2014, we completed development of the Frio A-2 zone. During the fourth quarter of 2019, tertiary production at Oyster Bayou Field averaged 4,261 Bbls/d, compared to 4,785 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2018. During 2020, we plan to invest in down-dip expansion of the Frio A-2 zone.
Tinsley Field.  We acquired Tinsley Field in 2006. This Mississippi field was discovered and first developed in the 1930s and is separated by different fault blocks.  As is the case with the majority of fields in Mississippi, Tinsley Field produces from multiple reservoirs.  Our CO2 enhanced oil recovery operations at Tinsley Field have thus far targeted the Woodruff formation, although there is additional potential in the Perry sandstone and other smaller reservoirs.  We commenced tertiary oil production from Tinsley Field in 2008 and substantially completed development of the Woodruff formation during 2014.  During the fourth quarter of 2019, tertiary oil production from the field averaged 4,343 Bbls/d, compared to 5,033 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2018. Although production from Tinsley Field is believed to have peaked in 2015 and is generally on decline, we continue to evaluate future potential investment opportunities in this field.
In addition to our tertiary operations at Tinsley Field, during 2018 and 2019, we conducted exploitation drilling in other oil-bearing formations in the field, and we continue to evaluate exploitation opportunities in additional horizons underlying the existing CO2 EOR flood.
West Yellow Creek Field. We acquired an approximate 48% non-operated working interest in West Yellow Creek Field in Mississippi in March 2017 for approximately $16 million, a field in which the operator had previously invested significant capital converting the field to a CO2 EOR flood. Under our arrangement with the operator, we supply CO2 to the field for a fee. West Yellow Creek Field is in close proximity and analogous to Eucutta Field, a very successful CO2 flood that we developed and continue to operate. We booked initial proved tertiary oil reserves at West Yellow Creek Field as of year-end 2017 and commenced tertiary production in early 2018. During the fourth quarter of 2019, tertiary oil production from the field averaged 807 Bbls/d compared to 375 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2018. Development of the field is ongoing, with future plans for continued tertiary development of the initial formation within the field.
Mature properties. Mature properties include our longest-producing properties which are generally located along our NEJD CO2 pipeline in southwest Mississippi and Louisiana and our Free State Pipeline in east Mississippi.  This group of properties includes our initial CO2 field, Little Creek, as well as several other fields (Brookhaven, Cranfield, Eucutta, Mallalieu, Martinville, McComb and Soso fields).  These fields accounted for 17% of our total 2019 CO2 EOR production and approximately 7% of our 
 13

Denbury Resources Inc.

year-end proved reserves.  These fields have been producing under CO2 flood for many years, in many cases more than a decade, and their production is generally declining, though we continue to evaluate future potential investment opportunities in these fields.
Future Tertiary Properties with No Tertiary Production or Proved Tertiary Reserves at December 31, 2019
Pending Sale of Working Interests in Certain Texas Fields. In December 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell half of our nearly 100% working interest positions in four conventional southeast Texas oil fields (consisting of Webster, Thompson, Manvel and East Hastings) for $50 million cash and a carried interest in ten wells to be drilled by the purchaser. The sale is currently expected to occur in early March 2020. Under the agreement, the purchaser is committed to funding 100% of the capital required to drill and complete an initial ten horizontal wells across the fields, with the first of the ten wells to be spud within six months of closing and with all ten wells to be completed within 18 months after closing. On these initial ten wells, Denbury will receive a 6.25% overriding royalty interest prior to the combined payout of the wells in a specified field and subsequent to payout, Denbury will receive production revenues from, and bear the cost of, its 50% working interest in each well. As part of the agreement, we will retain 100% ownership of the future Webster Unit CO2 flood, wherein (1) the purchaser may elect to participate in the future CO2 flood through reimbursement to Denbury of the purchaser’s working interest share of project costs incurred to date, or (2) if the purchaser declines to participate in the CO2 flood, we have the right to repurchase the purchaser’s working interest in Webster Field under a contractually agreed valuation mechanism.
Webster Field. We acquired our interest in Webster Field in 2012 as part of the Bakken Exchange Transaction. The field is located southeast of Houston, Texas, approximately eight miles northeast of our Hastings Field which we are currently flooding with CO2. At December 31, 2019, Webster Field had estimated proved non-tertiary reserves of approximately 3.2 MMBOE, net to our interest, all of which are proved developed.  During the fourth quarter of 2019, non-tertiary production at Webster Field, including production related to the Pending Gulf Coast Working Interests Sale (see Pending Sale of Working Interests in Certain Texas Fields above), averaged 923 BOE/d, compared to 841 BOE/d in the fourth quarter of 2018.  Webster Field is geologically similar to our Hastings Field, producing oil from the Frio zone at similar depths; as a result, we believe it is well suited for CO2 EOR. In 2014, we completed a nine-mile lateral between the Green Pipeline and Webster Field, which we plan will eventually deliver CO2 to the field. The timing of the development of a CO2 flood at Webster Field is primarily dependent upon capital availability and priorities and future oil prices.
Conroe Field.  Conroe Field, our largest potential tertiary flood in the Gulf Coast region, is located north of Houston, Texas.  We acquired a majority interest in this field in 2009 for $271 million in cash and 11.6 million shares of Denbury common stock, for a total aggregate value of $439 million.  Conroe Field had estimated proved non-tertiary reserves of approximately 9.5 MMBOE at December 31, 2019, net to our interest, all of which are proved developed.  During the fourth quarter of 2019, non-tertiary production at Conroe Field averaged 1,861 BOE/d, compared to 1,970 BOE/d in the fourth quarter of 2018.
To initiate a CO2 flood at Conroe Field, a pipeline must be constructed so that CO2 can be delivered to the field.  This pipeline, which is planned as an extension of our Green Pipeline, is preliminarily estimated to cover approximately 90 miles at a cost of approximately $220 million. Our current plan for initiating a CO2 flood at Conroe Field is scheduled several years from now, the timing of which may change depending on capital availability and priorities, future oil prices and pipeline construction.
In addition to the currently-producing oil-bearing formations at Conroe Field, we are evaluating exploitation opportunities in other formations. We currently do not have any additional wells planned for 2020 but continue to evaluate additional opportunities and plan to de-risk other areas of the field in the future.
Thompson Field. We acquired our interest in Thompson Field in June 2012 for $366 million. The field is located in Texas, approximately 18 miles west of our Hastings Field. Thompson Field had estimated proved non-tertiary reserves of approximately 4.3 MMBOE at December 31, 2019, net to our interest, all of which are proved developed.  During the fourth quarter of 2019, non-tertiary production at Thompson Field, including production related to the Pending Gulf Coast Working Interests Sale (see Pending Sale of Working Interests in Certain Texas Fields above), averaged 1,008 BOE/d, compared to 942 BOE/d in the fourth quarter of 2018.  Thompson Field is geologically similar to Hastings Field, producing oil from the Frio zone at similar depths, and we therefore believe it has CO2 EOR potential. Under the terms of the Thompson Field acquisition agreement, after the initiation of CO2 injection, the seller will retain approximately a 5% gross revenue interest (less severance taxes) once average monthly oil production exceeds 3,000 Bbls/d. The timing of the development of a CO2 flood at Thompson Field is primarily dependent upon capital availability and priorities and future oil prices.

Rocky Mountain Region
CO2 Sources and Pipelines
LaBarge Field.  We acquired an overriding royalty interest equivalent to an approximate one-third ownership interest in ExxonMobil’s CO2 reserves in LaBarge Field in the fourth quarter of 2012 as part of the Bakken Exchange Transaction. LaBarge Field is located in southwestern Wyoming, and as of December 31, 2019, our interest in LaBarge Field consisted of approximately 1.1 Tcf of proved CO2 reserves.
During 2019, we received an average of approximately 97 MMcf/d of CO2 from the Shute Creek gas processing plant at LaBarge Field that we used in our Rocky Mountain region CO2 floods. Based on current capacity, and subject to availability of CO2, we currently expect our CO2 volumes from Shute Creek to increase in future years. We pay ExxonMobil a fee to process and deliver the CO2, which we use in our Rocky Mountain region CO2 floods.
Other Rocky Mountain CO2 Sources.  We currently receive all of the CO2 from the ConocoPhillips-operated Lost Cabin gas plant in central Wyoming, which we currently expect to provide us as much as 30 MMcf/d of CO2 for use in our Rocky Mountain region CO2 floods. We currently estimate that our existing CO2 sources, plus additional CO2 from those or other CO2 sources in the region, are sufficient to carry out our base Rocky Mountain region EOR development plans.
Rocky Mountain CO2 Pipelines.  The 20-inch Greencore Pipeline in Wyoming is the first CO2 pipeline we constructed in the Rocky Mountain region.  We plan to use the pipeline as our trunk line in the Rocky Mountain region, eventually connecting our various Rocky Mountain region CO2 sources to the Cedar Creek Anticline in eastern Montana and western North Dakota. The 232-mile pipeline begins at the ConocoPhillips-operated Lost Cabin gas plant in Wyoming and terminates at Bell Creek Field in Montana.  We completed construction of the pipeline in 2012 and received our first CO2 deliveries from the ConocoPhillips-operated Lost Cabin gas plant during 2013.  During 2014, we completed construction of an interconnect between our Greencore Pipeline and an existing third-party CO2 pipeline in Wyoming, which enables us to transport CO2 from LaBarge Field to our Bell Creek Field.
In mid-2018, we sanctioned the CO2 enhanced oil recovery development project at Cedar Creek Anticline, which requires a 105-mile extension of the Greencore CO2 pipeline to CCA from Bell Creek Field. The capital outlay for the pipeline is projected to be approximately $150 million, of which we have incurred approximately $45 million through December 31, 2019 (see also Cedar Creek Anticline CO2 EOR Project below for further discussion).
Tertiary Properties with Tertiary Production and Proved Tertiary Reserves at December 31, 2019
Bell Creek Field.  We acquired our interest in Bell Creek Field in southeast Montana as part of the Encore merger in 2010.  The oil-producing reservoir in Bell Creek Field is a sandstone reservoir with characteristics similar to those we have successfully flooded with CO2 in the Gulf Coast region. During 2013, we began first CO2 injections into Bell Creek Field, recorded our first tertiary oil production, and booked initial proved tertiary reserves. Tertiary production during the fourth quarter of 2019 averaged 5,618 Bbls/d of oil, compared to 4,421 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2018.  During 2018, we completed the phase five expansion at the field, and in April 2019 commenced CO2 injection into phase six of the field development. The initial production response from the phase six expansion of the flood occurred in early 2020, though production will slowly ramp up during 2020 as additional wells begin to respond.
Grieve Field. Under a 2011 farm-in agreement, we obtained a 65% working interest in Grieve Field, located in Natrona County, Wyoming, in exchange for developing the Grieve Field CO2 flood. During 2016, the Company and its joint venture partner in Grieve Field revised their development arrangement for the field so that our partner funded $55 million of the remaining estimated capital to complete development of the facility and fieldwork in exchange for a 14% higher working interest and a disproportionate sharing of revenue from the first 2 million barrels of production. Thus, our working interest in the field was reduced from 65% to 51%, and our net revenue interest on the first million barrels of production is approximately 20%. We commenced tertiary production from Grieve Field during the fourth quarter of 2018 and booked initial proved tertiary reserves during 2019. Tertiary production during the fourth quarter of 2019 averaged 60 Bbls/d of oil, compared to 20 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Salt Creek Field.  We acquired our 23% non-operated working interest in Salt Creek Field in Wyoming for approximately $72 million in June 2017. Tertiary production during the fourth quarter of 2019 averaged 2,223 Bbls/d of oil, compared to 2,107 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Future Tertiary Properties with No Tertiary Production or Proved Tertiary Reserves at December 31, 2019
Cedar Creek Anticline.  CCA is the largest potential EOR property that we own and currently our largest producing property, contributing approximately 24% of our 2019 total production. Historical production from the property has primarily been from the Red River interval. The field is primarily located in Montana but extends over such a large area (approximately 126 miles) that it also extends into North Dakota.  CCA is a series of 13 different operating areas on a common geological trend, each of which could be considered a field by itself.  We acquired our initial interest in CCA as part of the Encore merger in 2010 and acquired additional interests from a wholly-owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips in 2013 for $1.0 billion, adding 42.2 MMBOE of incremental proved reserves at that date. Production from CCA averaged 13,730 BOE/d during the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to production during the fourth quarter of 2018 of 14,961 BOE/d. The non-tertiary proved reserves associated with CCA were 68.7 MMBOE, net to our interest, as of December 31, 2019.
In addition to the Red River interval, CCA contains other oil-bearing intervals including Mission Canyon and Charles B. We began pursuing these additional exploitation opportunities in late 2017. We have drilled nine successful Mission Canyon exploitation wells and a successful initial test well in Cabin Creek’s Charles B formation over the last few years. We continue to evaluate the Charles B formation and believe it has characteristics that would make it a good candidate for secondary or tertiary flooding.
Cedar Creek Anticline CO2 EOR Project. CCA is located approximately 110 miles north of Bell Creek Field, and our current plan is to connect this field to our Greencore Pipeline by the end of 2020.  In June 2018, we announced the sanctioning of the CO2 enhanced oil recovery development project at Cedar Creek Anticline. The estimated capital outlay to first tertiary production includes $150 million for a 105-mile extension of the Greencore CO2 pipeline from Bell Creek Field discussed above and an additional $150 million for facilities, well work and field development in the Red River formation at East Lookout Butte and Cedar Hills South fields in CCA. Approximately $50 million has been incurred through December 31, 2019, primarily related to purchase of pipe for the planned CO2 pipeline extension. First tertiary production is currently expected in the second half of 2022 or early 2023, with additional phases of development expected to target the Interlake, Stony Mountain and Red River formations at Cabin Creek Field. In light of the current oil price environment and the Company’s desire to preserve ongoing liquidity, the Company is continuing to evaluate the CCA tertiary development timeline, and in particular the construction of the pipeline in 2020, and currently anticipates finalizing its plans in the second quarter of 2020. See further discussion of the Company’s 2020 capital plans at Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Capital Resources and Liquidity – 2020 Capital Budget.
Hartzog Draw Field. We acquired our interest in Hartzog Draw Field in 2012 as part of the Bakken Exchange Transaction. The field is located in the Powder River Basin of northeastern Wyoming, approximately 12 miles from our Greencore Pipeline. Hartzog Draw Field had estimated proved reserves of approximately 2.6 MMBOE at December 31, 2019, net to our interest, 0.6 MMBOE of which relate to the natural gas producing Big George coal zone.  During the fourth quarter of 2019, non-tertiary production averaged 1,172 BOE/d, compared to 1,327 BOE/d in the fourth quarter of 2018. Industry activity around this field has been increasing for the last several years, with several operators testing various formations such as the Turner, Niobrara, Shannon, Parkman and Mowry for potential development. We believe the oil reservoir characteristics of Hartzog Draw Field make it well suited for CO2 EOR in the future. The timing of development of a CO2 flood at Hartzog Draw Field is primarily dependent upon capital availability and priorities and future oil prices.
Other Non-Tertiary Oil Properties
Despite the majority of our oil and natural gas properties discussed above consisting of either existing or planned future tertiary floods, we also produce oil and natural gas either from fields in both our Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions that are not amenable to EOR or from specific reservoirs (within an existing tertiary field) that are not amenable to EOR. For example, at Heidelberg Field, we produce natural gas from the Selma Chalk reservoir, which is separate from the Christmas and Eutaw reservoirs currently being flooded with CO2. Continuing production from these other non-tertiary properties totaled 1,567 BOE/d during the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to 1,611 BOE/d during the fourth quarter of 2018.

(1) | An exploratory well is a well drilled to find a new field or to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of oil or natural gas in another reservoir. Generally, an exploratory well is any well that is not a development well, an extension well, a service well or a stratigraphic test well. A development well is a well drilled within the proved area of an oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive. 


(2) | A productive well is an exploratory or development well drilled and completed during the year and found to be capable of producing either oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or natural gas well.


(3) | A non-productive well is an exploratory or development well that is not a productive well.


(4) | During 2019, 2018 and 2017, an additional 7, 4 and 3 wells, respectively, were drilled for water or CO2 injection purposes.

PRODUCTION AND UNIT PRICES
Further information regarding average production rates, unit sales prices and unit costs per BOE are set forth under Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations – Operating Results Table, included herein.
TITLE TO PROPERTIES
As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, Denbury conducts a limited title examination at the time of its acquisition of properties or leasehold interests targeted for enhanced recovery, and curative work is performed with respect to significant defects on higher-value properties of the greatest significance. We believe that title to our oil and natural gas properties is good and defensible, subject only to such exceptions that we believe do not materially interfere with the use of such properties, including encumbrances, easements, restrictions and royalty, overriding royalty and other similar interests.

SIGNIFICANT OIL AND GAS PURCHASERS AND PRODUCT MARKETING
Oil and natural gas sales are made on a day-to-day basis or under short-term contracts at the current area market price. We would not expect the loss of any single purchaser to have a material adverse effect upon our operations; however, the loss of a large single purchaser could potentially reduce the competition for our oil and natural gas production, which in turn could negatively impact the prices we receive.  For the year ended December 31, 2019, three purchasers accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas revenues: Plains Marketing LP (32%), Hunt Crude Oil Supply Company (11%) and Sunoco Inc. (11%). For the year ended December 31, 2018, two purchasers accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas revenues: Plains Marketing LP (24%) and Hunt Crude Oil Supply Company (10%). For the year ended December 31, 2017, two purchasers accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas revenues: Plains Marketing LP (22%) and Marathon Petroleum Company (10%).
Our ability to market oil and natural gas depends on many factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and natural gas, the proximity of our oil and natural gas production to pipelines and corresponding markets, the available capacity in such pipelines, the demand for oil and natural gas, the effects of weather, and the effects of state and federal regulation.  As of December 31, 2019, we have not experienced significant difficulty in finding a market for all of our production as it becomes available or in transporting our production to those markets; however, there is no assurance that we will always be able to market all of our production or obtain favorable prices.
Oil Marketing
Prices received in a regional market fluctuate frequently and can differ from NYMEX pricing due to a variety of reasons, including supply and/or demand factors, crude oil quality and location differentials. The oil differentials we received in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions are discussed in further detail below.
Crude oil prices in the Gulf Coast region are generally positive to NYMEX and highly correlated to the changes in prices of crude oil sold under Light Louisiana Sweet. Our average NYMEX oil differential in the Gulf Coast region was a positive $3.30 per Bbl during 2019, compared to a positive $2.94 per Bbl and a positive $0.22 per Bbl during 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our current markets at various sales points along the Gulf Coast have sufficient demand to accommodate our production, but there can be no assurance of future demand.
The marketing of our Rocky Mountain region oil production is dependent on transportation through local pipelines to market centers in Guernsey, Wyoming; Clearbrook, Minnesota; Wood River, Illinois; and most recently Cushing, Oklahoma.  Shipments on some of the pipelines are at or near capacity and may be subject to apportionment.  We currently have access to, or have contracted for, sufficient pipeline capacity to move our oil production; however, there can be no assurance that we will be allocated sufficient pipeline capacity to move all of our oil production in the future.  Because local demand for production is small in comparison to current production levels, much of the production in the Rocky Mountain region is transported to markets outside of the region. Therefore, prices in the Rocky Mountain region are further influenced by fluctuations in prices (primarily Brent and LLS) in coastal markets and by available pipeline capacity in the Midwest and Cushing markets. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the discount for our oil production relative to NYMEX in the Rocky Mountain region averaged $2.01 per Bbl, compared to $1.50 per Bbl during 2018 and $1.39 per Bbl during 2017.
COMPETITION AND MARKETS
We face competition from other oil and natural gas companies in all aspects of our business, including acquisition of producing properties, oil and gas leases, drilling rights, and CO2 properties; marketing of oil and natural gas; and obtaining and maintaining goods, services and labor.  Many of our competitors have substantially larger financial and other resources.  Factors that affect our ability to acquire producing properties include available liquidity, available information about prospective properties and our expectations for earning a minimum projected return on our investments.  Because of the primary nature of our core assets (our tertiary operations) and our ownership of relatively uncommon significant natural sources of CO2 in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions, we believe that we are effective in competing in the market and have less competition than our peers in certain aspects of our business.
The demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations and for geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with commodity prices, causing periodic shortages in such personnel.  Prior to the downturn in oil prices, the competition for qualified 
 20

Denbury Resources Inc.

technical personnel had been extensive, and our personnel costs escalated. There were also periods with shortages of drilling rigs and other equipment, as demand for rigs and equipment increased along with the number of wells being drilled.  These factors also cause significant increases in costs for equipment, services and personnel.  We cannot be certain when we will experience these issues, and these types of shortages or price increases could significantly decrease our profit margin, cash flow and operating results, and cause significant delays in our development operations.
FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS
Numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the oil and gas industry.  Additions or changes to these laws and regulations are often made in response to the current political or economic environment. Compliance with the evolving regulatory landscape is often difficult, and substantial penalties may be incurred for noncompliance. Additionally, the future annual cost of complying with all laws and regulations applicable to our operations is uncertain and will be ultimately determined by several factors, including future changes to legal and regulatory requirements. Management believes that continued compliance with existing laws and regulations applicable to our operations and future compliance therewith will not have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, although such laws and regulations, and compliance therewith, could cause significant delays or otherwise impede operations, which may, among other things, cause our expected production rates and cash flows to be less than anticipated.
The following sections describe some specific laws and regulations that may affect us.  We cannot predict the cost or impact of these or other future legislative or regulatory initiatives.
Regulation of Oil and Gas Exploration and Production
Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels.  Such regulation includes requiring permits for drilling wells; maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells; the method of drilling and casing wells; the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled; the plugging and abandoning of wells; and the composition or disposal of chemicals and fluids used in connection with operations.  Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations.  These include regulation of the size of drilling, spacing or proration units and the density of wells that may be drilled in those units, and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties.  In addition, federal and state conservation laws, which establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells, generally prohibit or restrict the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production.  The effect of these laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and may limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill.  Regulatory requirements and compliance relative to the oil and gas industry increase our costs of doing business and, consequently, affect our profitability.
Federal Regulation of Sales Prices and Transportation
The transportation of, and certain sales with respect to, natural gas in interstate commerce are heavily regulated by agencies of the U.S. federal government and are affected by, among other things, the availability, terms and cost of transportation.  Notably, the price and terms of access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive U.S. federal and state regulation.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) is continually proposing and implementing new and/or modified rules and regulations affecting the natural gas industry, some of which may adversely affect the availability and reliability of interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines.  While our sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently subject to FERC regulation, our ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on certain pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to FERC regulation.  Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are considered from time to time by Congress, FERC, state regulatory bodies and the courts, and we cannot predict when or if any such proposals or proceedings might become effective and their effect or impact, if any, on our operations.
Federal Energy and Climate Change Legislation and Regulation
The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011, among other things, updated federal pipeline safety standards, increased penalties for violations of such standards, gave the Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (the “PHMSA”) authority for new damage prevention and incident notification, and directed the PHMSA to prescribe new minimum safety standards for CO2 pipelines, which safety standards could affect our operations and the costs thereof. While the PHMSA has adopted or proposed to adopt a number of new regulations to implement this act, no new minimum safety standards have been proposed or adopted for CO2 pipelines.

Both federal and state authorities have in recent years proposed new regulations to limit the emission of pollutants, including greenhouse gas emissions, as part of climate change initiatives and the Clean Air Act.  For example, both the EPA and BLM have issued regulations for the control of methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. The EPA has promulgated regulations requiring permitting for certain sources of greenhouse gas emissions, and in May 2016, promulgated final regulations to reduce methane and volatile organic compound emissions from the oil and gas sector. In July 2017, a federal appeals court rejected an attempt by the EPA to delay implementation of the rule. In September 2018, the EPA proposed amendments to the rule that are targeted at reducing regulatory requirements and streamlining the rule’s implementation. In September 2019, the EPA also issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that, if finalized, would remove the methane specific regulations imposed by the 2016 final rule and remove certain other emission limitations placed on new or reconstructed transmission and storage facilities. Enforcement of these regulations may impose additional costs related to compliance with new emission limits, as well as inspections and maintenance of several types of equipment used in our operations. 
Natural Gas Gathering Regulations
State and federal regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory-take requirements.  With the increase in construction and operation of natural gas gathering lines in various states, natural gas gathering is receiving greater regulatory scrutiny from state and federal regulatory agencies, which is likely to continue in the future.
Federal, State or Indian Leases
Our operations on federal, state or Indian oil and gas leases, especially those in the Rocky Mountain region, are subject to numerous restrictions, including nondiscrimination statutes. Such operations must be conducted pursuant to certain on-site security regulations and other permits and authorizations issued by the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and other federal and state stakeholder agencies.
Environmental Regulations
Our oil and natural gas production, saltwater disposal operations, injection of CO2, and the processing, handling and disposal of materials such as hydrocarbons and naturally occurring radioactive materials (“NORM”) are subject to stringent regulation.  We could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs resulting from a release of product, third-party claims for property damage and personal injuries, or penalties and other sanctions as a result of any violations or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations or other laws and regulations applicable to our operations.  Changes in, or more stringent enforcement of, environmental laws and other laws applicable to our operations could also result in delays or additional operating costs and capital expenditures.
Various federal, state and local laws and regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment and human health, directly impact our oil and gas exploration, development and production operations.  These include, among others, (1) regulations adopted by the EPA and various state agencies regarding approved methods of disposal for certain hazardous and nonhazardous wastes; (2) the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and analogous state laws that regulate the removal or remediation of previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), property contamination (including groundwater contamination), and remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination; (3) the Clean Air Act and comparable state and local requirements already applicable to our operations and new restrictions on air emissions from our operations, including greenhouse gas emissions and those that could discourage the production of fossil fuels that, when used, ultimately release CO2; (4) the Clean Water Act and comparable state and local requirements already applicable to our operations and new restrictions on wastewater discharges from our operations; (5) the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of, and response to, oil spills into waters of the United States; (6) the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which is the principal federal statute governing the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes; (7) the Endangered Species Act and counterpart state legislation, which protects certain species (and their related habitats), including certain species that could be present on our leases, as threatened or endangered; and (8) state regulations and statutes governing the handling, treatment, storage and disposal of NORM and other wastes.
In the Rocky Mountain Region, federal agencies’ actions based upon their environmental review responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act can significantly impact the scope and timing of hydrocarbon development by slowing the 
 22

Denbury Resources Inc.

timing of individual applications for permits to drill and requests for rights-of-way, and delaying large scale planning associated with region-level resource management plans and project-level master development plans.
Management believes that we are currently in substantial compliance with existing applicable environmental laws and regulations, and does not currently anticipate that future compliance will have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, although such laws and regulations, and compliance therewith, could cause significant delays or otherwise impede operations, which may, among other things, cause our expected production rates and cash flows to be less than anticipated.
Hydraulic Fracturing
During 2019, we fracture stimulated seven wells, primarily at Bell Creek Field utilizing water-based fluids. We currently have plans to potentially hydraulically fracture up to ten wells during 2020, consisting primarily of small skin fractures that are utilized to remove contaminants caused by drilling muds and increase permeability near the wellbore. We are familiar with the laws and regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing operations and take steps to ensure compliance with these requirements.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND RECONCILIATIONS
Reconciliation of Standardized Measure to PV-10 Value
PV-10 Value is a non-GAAP measure and is different from the Standardized Measure in that PV-10 Value is a pre-tax number and the Standardized Measure is an after-tax number.  The information used to calculate PV-10 Value is derived directly from data determined in accordance with FASC Topic 932.  We believe that PV-10 Value is a useful supplemental disclosure to the Standardized Measure because the Standardized Measure can be impacted by a company’s unique tax situation, and it is not practical to calculate the Standardized Measure on a property-by-property basis.  Because of this, PV-10 Value is a widely used measure within the industry and is commonly used by securities analysts, banks and credit rating agencies to evaluate the estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves on a comparative basis across companies or specific properties.  PV-10 Value is commonly used by us and others in our industry to evaluate properties that are bought and sold, to assess the potential return on investment in our oil and natural gas properties, and to perform our impairment testing of oil and natural gas properties. PV-10 Value is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Standardized Measure.  Our PV-10 Value and the Standardized Measure do not purport to represent the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves. See also Glossary and Selected Abbreviations for the definition of “PV-10 Value” and Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Disclosures (Unaudited) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures about the Standardized Measure.
The following table provides a reconciliation of the Standardized Measure to PV-10 Value for the periods indicated:

PV-10 Value (non-GAAP measure) | $ | 2,615,668 | | | $ | 4,025,139 | | $ | 2,533,798

Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDAX
Adjusted EBITDAX is a non-GAAP financial measure which management uses and is calculated based upon (but not identical to) a financial covenant related to “Consolidated EBITDAX” in our senior secured bank credit facility, which excludes certain items that are included in net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Items excluded include interest, income taxes, depletion, depreciation, and amortization, and items that the Company believes affect the comparability of operating results such as items whose timing and/or amount cannot be reasonably estimated or are non-recurring. Management believes Adjusted EBITDAX may be helpful to investors in order to assess our operating performance as compared to that of other companies in our industry, without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical costs basis. It is also commonly used by third parties to assess the Company’s leverage and ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or more meaningful than, net income, cash flows from operations, or any other measure reported in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s Adjusted EBITDAX may not be comparable to similarly titled 
 23

Denbury Resources Inc.

measures of another company because all companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDAX, EBITDAX, or EBITDA in the same manner.
The following table presents a reconciliation of our net income to Adjusted EBITDAX for the periods indicated:
