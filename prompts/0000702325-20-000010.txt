Northern Oak Wealth Management, Inc.
Northern Oak Wealth Management ("Northern Oak"), a Wisconsin corporation, is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Northern Oak provides investment advisory and wealth management services to individual and institutional customers.
First Midwest Capital Trust I, Great Lakes Statutory Trust II, Great Lakes Statutory Trust III, Northern States Statutory Trust I, Bridgeview Statutory Trust I, Bridgeview Capital Trust II
First Midwest Capital Trust I, a Delaware statutory business trust, was formed in 2003. Great Lakes Statutory Trust II, Great Lakes Statutory Trust III, Northern States Statutory Trust I, Bridgeview Statutory Trust I, and Bridgeview Capital Trust II are Delaware statutory business trusts that were acquired through acquisitions. These trusts were established for the purpose of issuing trust-preferred securities and lending the proceeds to the Company in return for junior subordinated debentures of the Company. The Company guarantees payments of distributions on the trust-preferred securities and payments on redemption of the trust-preferred securities on a limited basis.
These trusts qualify as variable interest entities for which the Company is not the primary beneficiary. Consequently, the accounts of those entities are not consolidated in the Company's financial statements. However, the combined $90.7 million of trust-preferred securities held by the six trusts as of December 31, 2019 are included in the Company's Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes. For additional discussion of the regulatory capital treatment of trust-preferred securities, see the section of this Item 1 titled "Capital Requirements" below.
Segments

Our Business
The Bank has been in the business of commercial and consumer banking for nearly 80 years, attracting deposits, making loans, and providing treasury and wealth management services. The Bank operates in the most active and diverse markets in Illinois, including the metropolitan Chicago market and central and western Illinois. The Bank's other market areas include southeastern Wisconsin, northwestern Indiana, and eastern Iowa. These areas encompass urban, suburban, and rural markets, and contain a diversified mix of industry groups.
No individual or single group of related accounts is considered material in relation to the assets or deposits of the Bank or in relation to the overall business of the Company. The Bank does not engage in any sub-prime lending, nor does it engage in investment banking activities. 
Deposit and Retail Services
The Bank offers a full range of deposit products and services, including checking, NOW, money market, and savings accounts and various types of short and long-term certificates of deposit. These products are tailored to our market areas at competitive rates. In addition to these products, the Bank offers debit and automated teller machine ("ATM") cards, credit cards, internet and mobile banking, telephone banking, and financial education services. 
Corporate and Consumer Lending
The Bank originates commercial and industrial, agricultural, commercial real estate, and consumer loans, primarily to businesses and residents in the Bank's market areas. In addition to originating loans, the Bank offers capital market products to commercial customers, which include derivatives and interest rate risk mitigation products. The Bank's largest category of lending is commercial real estate, followed by commercial and industrial. For detailed information regarding the Company's loan portfolio, see the "Loan Portfolio and Credit Quality" section of "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Item 7 of this Form 10-K.
Commercial and Industrial and Agricultural Loans – The Bank provides commercial and industrial loans to middle market businesses generally within the Bank's market areas. Our broad range of financing products includes supporting working capital needs, accounts receivable financing, inventory and equipment financing, and select sector-based lending, such as healthcare, asset-based lending, structured finance, and syndications. The Bank provides agricultural loans to meet seasonal production, equipment, and farm real estate borrowing needs of individual and corporate crop and livestock producers. The Bank also provides these commercial and industrial and agricultural loan products to customers outside of its primary market area that fall within the Bank's credit guidelines.
Commercial Real Estate Loans – The Bank provides a wide array of financing products to developers, investors, other real estate professionals, and owners of various businesses, which include funding for the construction, purchase, refinance, or improvement of commercial real estate properties. The mix of properties securing the loans in the Bank's commercial real estate portfolio is balanced between owner-occupied and investor categories and is diverse in terms of type and geographic location, generally within the Bank's market areas. 
Consumer Loans – Consumer loan products include mortgages, home equity lines and loans, personal loans, specialty loans, and consumer secured and unsecured loans. These products are primarily provided to the residents who live and work within the Bank's market areas. The Bank also provides these consumer loan products to customers outside of its primary market area that fall within the Bank's credit guidelines.
Treasury Management
Our treasury management products and services provide commercial customers the ability to manage cash flow. These products include receivable services such as Automated Clearing House ("ACH") collections, lockbox, remote deposit capture, and financial electronic data interchange, payables and payroll services such as wire transfer, account reconciliation, controlled disbursement, direct deposit, and positive pay, information reporting services, liquidity management, corporate credit cards, fraud prevention, and merchant services.

These services are provided through credentialed investment and wealth management professionals who identify opportunities and provide services tailored to our customers' goals and objectives.
Growth and Acquisitions
In the normal course of business, the Company explores potential opportunities for expansion in our primary and adjacent market areas through organic growth and the acquisition of financial institutions, branches, and non-banking organizations. As a matter of policy, the Company generally does not comment on any dialogue or negotiations with potential targets or possible acquisitions until a definitive acquisition agreement is signed. The Company's ability to engage in certain merger or acquisition transactions depends on the bank regulators' views at the time as to the capital levels, quality of management, and overall condition of the Company, in addition to their assessment of a variety of other factors, including our compliance with law and regulations. The Company has announced and successfully completed a number of acquisitions, which include the following recent transactions:
Pending Acquisition
During 2019, the Company entered into a merger agreement to acquire Bankmanagers Corp. ("Bankmanagers"), the holding company for Park Bank, based in Milwaukee Wisconsin. The acquisition is subject to customary regulatory approvals and the completion of various closing conditions.

Additional detail regarding certain recent acquisitions is contained in Note 3 of "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Competition
The banking and financial services industry in the markets in which the Company operates (and particularly the metropolitan Chicago area) is highly competitive. Generally, the Company competes with other local, regional, national, and internet banks and savings and loan associations, FinTech companies, personal loan and finance companies, credit unions, mutual funds, credit funds, investment brokers, and trust and wealth management providers. Some of these competitors may be larger and have more financial resources than us or may be subject to fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures.
Competition is driven by a number of factors, including interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits, the ability to attract new deposits, the scope and type of banking and financial services offered, the hours during which business can be conducted, the location of bank branches and ATMs, the availability, ease of use, and range of banking services provided on the internet and through mobile devices, the availability of related services, and a variety of additional services, such as trust, wealth management, and investment advisory services.
In providing investment advisory services, the Company also competes with retail and discount stockbrokers, investment advisers, mutual funds, insurance companies, and other financial institutions for wealth management customers. Competition is generally based on the variety of products and services offered to customers and the performance of funds under management. The Company's main competitors are financial service providers both within and outside of the market areas in which the Company maintains offices.
Our Colleagues and Culture
The Company faces competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees. Its ability to continue to compete effectively will depend on its ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate existing employees. As of December 31, 2019, the Company and its subsidiaries employed a total of 2,122 full-time equivalent employees. 
Anchored in our vision, mission, and values, First Midwest drives business performance and accelerates economic and social momentum by investing in our colleagues, clients, and the communities we serve. The Company understands that its employees are its most valued asset and recognizes an engaged and supported workforce is key to driving success for both the Company's clients and business. In order to attract and retain the best talent, the Company offers competitive compensation and a range of 
high-quality benefits that enable its employees to achieve their health, lifestyle and financial goals. Those benefits include medical, dental, vision, life and disability insurance, parental leave, family medical leave and paid time off, savings and profit-sharing retirement programs, income protection benefits, adoption assistance, tuition reimbursement, and matching individual charitable gifts. In 2019, the Company received the Chicago Tribune Top Places to Work Award as a direct result of its efforts to create a supportive and inclusive work environment for its employees. 
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property is important to the success of our business. We own a variety of trademarks, service marks, trade names, and logos and spend time and resources maintaining our intellectual property portfolio. We control access to our intellectual property through license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third-parties, employment agreements, and other contractual arrangements protecting our intellectual property.
Supervision and Regulation
The Bank is an Illinois state-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve") has the primary federal authority to examine and supervise the Bank in coordination with the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (the "IDFPR"). The Company is a single bank holding company and is also subject to the primary regulatory authority of the Federal Reserve. The Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to extensive secondary regulation and supervision by various state and federal governmental regulatory authorities, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), which insures deposits and assets covered by loss share agreements with the FDIC (the "FDIC Agreements"), and the United States ("U.S.") Department of the Treasury (the "Treasury"), which enforces money laundering and currency transaction regulations. As a public company, the Company is also subject to the regulatory authority of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Premier and Northern Oak, our registered investment advisers, are also subject to the regulatory authority of the SEC, including under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
Federal and state laws and regulations generally applicable to financial institutions regulate the Company's and our subsidiaries' scope of business, investments, reserves against deposits, capital levels, the nature and amount of collateral for loans, the establishment of branches, mergers, acquisitions, dividends, and other matters. This supervision and regulation is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC's deposit insurance fund ("DIF"), the bank's depositors, and the stability of the U.S. financial system, rather than the stockholders or debt holders of a financial institution.
The following sections describe the significant elements of certain statutes and regulations affecting the Company and its subsidiaries, some of which are not yet effective or remain subject to ongoing revision and rulemaking.
Bank Holding Company Act of 1956
Generally, the BHC Act governs the acquisition and control of banks and non-banking companies by bank holding companies and requires bank holding companies to register with the Federal Reserve. The BHC Act requires a bank holding company to file an annual report of its operations and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require. A bank holding company and its subsidiaries are subject to examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve.
The BHC Act, the Bank Merger Act, and other federal and state statutes regulate acquisitions of commercial banks. The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve for the direct or indirect acquisition by a bank holding company of more than 5.0% of the voting shares of a commercial bank or its holding company. Under the BHC Act or the Bank Merger Act, the prior approval of the Federal Reserve or other appropriate bank regulatory authority is required for a bank holding company to acquire another bank or for a member bank to merge with another bank or purchase the assets or assume the deposits of another bank. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, the bank regulatory authorities will consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position of the combined organization, the risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system, the applicant's managerial and financial resources, the applicant's performance record under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended (the "CRA"), fair housing laws and other consumer compliance laws, and the effectiveness of the banks in combating money laundering activities.
In addition, the BHC Act prohibits (with certain exceptions) a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect control or ownership of more than 5.0% of the voting shares of any "non-banking" company unless the non-banking activities are found by the Federal Reserve to be "so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto." Under current regulations of the Federal Reserve, a bank holding company and its non-bank subsidiaries are permitted to engage in such banking-related business ventures as consumer finance, equipment leasing, data processing, mortgage banking, financial and investment advice, securities brokerage services, and other activities.
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, as amended (the "GLB Act"), allows certain bank holding companies to elect to be treated as a financial holding company (a "FHC") that may offer customers a more comprehensive array of financial products and services. At this time, the Company has not elected to be a FHC.
Transactions with Affiliates
Any transactions between the Bank and the Company and their respective subsidiaries are regulated by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve's regulations limit the types and amounts of covered transactions engaged in between the Company and the Bank and generally require those transactions to be on terms at least as favorable to the Bank as if the transaction were conducted with an unaffiliated third-party. Covered transactions are defined by statute to include:
•A loan or extension of credit to an affiliate, as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate, by the Bank.
•The purchase of assets by the Bank from an affiliate, unless otherwise exempted by the Federal Reserve.
•Certain derivative transactions involving the Bank that create a credit exposure to an affiliate.
•The acceptance by the Bank of securities issued by an affiliate as collateral for a loan.
•The issuance of a guarantee, acceptance, or letter of credit by the Bank on behalf of an affiliate.
In general, these regulations require that any extension of credit by the Bank (or its subsidiaries) with an affiliate must be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral and must be limited to certain thresholds on an individual and aggregate basis.
The Bank is also limited as to how much and on what terms it may lend to its insiders and the insiders of its affiliates, including executive officers and directors.
Source of Strength
Federal Reserve policy and federal law require bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. Under this requirement, a holding company is expected to commit resources to support its bank subsidiary even at times when the holding company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources or when the holding company may not be inclined to provide it. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company's bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a bank subsidiary will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.
Community Reinvestment Act of 1977
The CRA requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas consistent with safe and sound banking practices. Under the CRA, each depository institution is required to help meet the credit needs of its market areas by, among other things, providing credit to low-income and moderate-income individuals and communities. Federal regulators conduct CRA examinations on a regular basis to assess the performance of financial institutions and assign one of four ratings to the institution's record of meeting the credit needs of its community. Bank regulators take into account CRA ratings when considering approval of a proposed merger or acquisition. As of its last examination report issued in May 2017, the Bank received a rating of "outstanding," the highest rating available. The Bank has received an overall "outstanding" rating in each of its CRA performance evaluations since 1998. In December 2019, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC") and the FDIC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking intended to (i) clarify which activities qualify for CRA credit; (ii) update where activities count for CRA credit; (iii) create a more transparent and objective method for measuring CRA performance; and (iv) provide for more transparent, consistent, and timely CRA-related data collection, recordkeeping, and reporting. However, the Federal Reserve has not joined the proposed rulemaking. Management will continue to evaluate any changes to the CRA's regulations and their impact to the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.
Financial Privacy
Under the GLB Act, a financial institution may not disclose non-public personal information about a consumer to unaffiliated third-parties unless the institution satisfies various disclosure requirements and the consumer has not elected to opt out of the information sharing. The financial institution must provide its customers with a notice of its privacy policies and practices. The Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and other financial regulatory agencies issued regulations implementing notice requirements and restrictions on a financial institution's ability to disclose non-public personal information about consumers to unaffiliated third-parties.
Bank Secrecy Act and USA PATRIOT Act
The Bank Secrecy and USA PATRIOT Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent them from being used for money laundering, terrorist, and other illegal activities. If such activities are detected or suspected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury's Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new accounts. Failure to comply with these requirements could have serious financial, legal, and reputational consequences, including the imposition of civil money penalties or causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions.
Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation
The U.S. imposes economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals, and others. These sanctions are administered by the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"). These sanctions include: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on "U.S. persons" engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country, and (ii) blocking assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off, or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious financial, legal, and reputational consequences for the institution, including the imposition of civil money penalties or causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions.
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") significantly restructured the financial regulatory regime in the U.S. Some of the Dodd-Frank Act's provisions, which are described in more detail below, may have the consequence of increasing the Company's expenses, decreasing the Company's revenues, and changing the activities in which the Company chooses to engage. 
Enhanced Prudential Standards – The Dodd-Frank Act, as amended by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 ("EGRRCPA"), directs the Federal Reserve to monitor emerging risks to financial stability and enact enhanced supervision and prudential standards applicable to bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $250 billion or more and non-bank covered companies designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (often referred to as systemically important financial institutions). The Dodd-Frank Act mandates that certain regulatory requirements applicable to systemically important financial institutions be more stringent than those applicable to other financial institutions. In general, EGRRCPA and implementing regulations increased the statutory asset threshold above which the Federal Reserve is required to apply these enhanced prudential standards from $50 billion to $250 billion (subject to certain discretion by the Federal Reserve to apply any enhanced prudential standard requirement to any BHC with between $100 billion and $250 billion of total consolidated assets that would otherwise be exempt under EGRRCPA). BHCs with $250 billion or more of total consolidated assets remain fully subject to the Dodd-Frank Act's enhanced prudential standards requirements.
In February 2014, the Federal Reserve adopted rules to implement certain of these enhanced prudential standards. These rules required publicly traded bank holding companies with $10 billion or more of total consolidated assets to establish risk committees and required bank holding companies with $50 billion or more of total consolidated assets to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk management standards. The Company established a risk committee in accordance with this requirement. In October 2019, the Federal Reserve adopted a rule that tailors the application of the enhanced prudential standards to BHCs pursuant to the EGRRCPA amendments, including by raising the asset threshold for application of many of these standards. Pursuant to the final rules, publicly traded bank holding companies with between $10 billion and $50 billion of total consolidated assets, including the Company, are no longer required to maintain a risk committee. The Company has determined that it will nevertheless retain its risk committee.
Consumer Financial Protection – The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB") as a new and independent unit within the Federal Reserve. The powers of the CFPB currently include primary enforcement and exclusive supervision authority for federal consumer financial laws over insured depository institutions with assets of $10 billion or more, such as the Bank, and their affiliates. This includes the right to obtain information about an institution's activities and compliance systems and procedures and to detect and assess risks to consumers and markets.
The CFPB engages in several activities, including (i) investigating consumer complaints about credit cards and mortgages, (ii) launching supervisory programs, (iii) conducting research for and developing mandatory financial product disclosures, and (iv) engaging in consumer financial protection rulemaking.
The Bank is also subject to a number of regulations intended to protect consumers in various areas, such as equal credit opportunity, fair lending, customer privacy, identity theft, and fair credit reporting. For example, the Bank is subject to the Federal Truth in Savings Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. Electronic banking activities are subject to federal law, including the Electronic Funds Transfer Act. Wealth management activities of the Bank are subject to the Illinois Corporate Fiduciaries Act. Consumer loans made by the Bank are subject to applicable provisions of the Federal Truth in Lending Act. Other consumer financial laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and applicable state laws.
In addition, state authorities are responsible for monitoring the Company's compliance with all state consumer laws. Failure to comply with these federal and state requirements could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the Company and the Bank, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions.
Interchange Fees – Under the Durbin Amendment of the Dodd-Frank Act ("Durbin"), the Federal Reserve established a maximum permissible interchange fee equal to no more than 21 cents plus five basis points of the transaction value for many types of debit interchange transactions. Interchange fees, or "swipe" fees, are charges that merchants pay to card-issuing banks, such as the Bank, for processing electronic payment transactions. The Federal Reserve also adopted a rule to allow a debit card issuer to recover one cent per transaction for fraud prevention purposes if the issuer complies with certain fraud-related requirements required by the Federal Reserve. The Company is in compliance with these fraud-related requirements. The Federal Reserve also has rules governing routing and exclusivity that require issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product. The interchange fee limitations became effective for the Company on July 1, 2017.
Capital Requirements
The Company and the Bank are each required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the Federal Reserve. In July 2013, the federal bank regulators approved final rules (the "Basel III Capital Rules") implementing the Basel III framework set forth by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the "Basel Committee") as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.
Since full phase-in on January 1, 2019, the Basel III Capital Rules have required the Company and the Bank to maintain the following:
•A minimum ratio of Common equity Tier 1 capital ("CET1") to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% "capital conservation buffer" (resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0%).
•A minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%).
•A minimum ratio of total capital (Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5%). 
•A minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets.
The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum, but below the conservation buffer, will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall and the institution's "eligible retained income" (that is, four quarter trailing net income, net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income).
The Basel III Capital Rules also provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1 that were phased-in over a four-year period through January 1, 2019. In November 2017, the federal bank regulators issued a final rule that retains certain existing transition provisions related to the capital treatment for certain deferred tax assets, mortgage servicing rights, investments in non-consolidated financial entities, and minority interests for banking organizations, such as the Company and the Bank, that are not subject to the advanced approaches framework (the "Transition Rule"). Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive items are included for purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios; however, the Company and the Bank made a one-time permanent election to exclude these items.
In July 2019, the federal bank regulators adopted final rules intended to simplify the capital treatment for certain deferred tax assets, mortgage servicing assets, investments in non-consolidated financial entities and minority interests for banking organizations, such as the Company and the Bank, that are not subject to the advanced approaches framework (the "Capital 
Simplification Rules"). The Capital Simplification Rules and the rescission of the Transition Rule took effect for the Company as of January 1, 2020. 
In December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms (the standards are commonly referred to as "Basel IV"). Among other things, these standards revise the Basel Committee's standardized approach for credit risk (including the recalibration of risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain "unconditionally cancellable commitments," such as unused credit card lines of credit) and provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital. Under the Basel framework, these standards will generally be effective on January 1, 2022, with an aggregate output floor phasing in through January 1, 2027. Under the current U.S. capital rules, operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches banking organizations, and not to the Company or the Bank. The impact of Basel IV on the Company and the Bank will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by the federal bank regulators.
Prompt Corrective Action
The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended ("FDIA"), requires the federal banking agencies to take "prompt corrective action" for depository institutions that do not meet the minimum capital requirements. The FDIA includes the following five capital tiers: "well-capitalized," "adequately capitalized," "undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized" and "critically undercapitalized." A depository institution's capital tier will depend on how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. The relevant capital measures are the total risk-based capital ratio, the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, the CET1 capital ratio, and the leverage ratio.
A bank will be:
•"Well-capitalized" if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. 
•"Adequately capitalized" if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and is not "well-capitalized." 
•"Undercapitalized" if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a CET1 capital ratio of less than 4.5%, or a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%. 
•"Significantly undercapitalized" if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a CET1 capital ratio of less than 3.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%.
•"Critically undercapitalized" if the institution's tangible equity is equal to or less than 2.0% of average quarterly tangible assets.
An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating for certain matters. A bank's capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank's overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes. As of December 31, 2019, the Bank was "well-capitalized" based on its ratios as defined above.
The FDIA prohibits an insured depository institution from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank's normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited), unless it is well-capitalized or is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A depository institution that is adequately capitalized and accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the FDIC may not pay an interest rate on any deposits in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market areas.
In addition, the FDIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be "undercapitalized." "Undercapitalized" institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. The agencies may not accept such a plan without determining that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution's capital. In addition, the depository institution's parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with the capital restoration plan and must also provide appropriate assurances of performance for a plan to be acceptable. The aggregate liability of the parent holding company is limited to the lesser of an amount equal to 5.0% of the depository institution's total assets at the time it became undercapitalized and the amount that is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards 
applicable to the institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is "significantly undercapitalized."
"Significantly undercapitalized" depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become "adequately capitalized," requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. "Critically undercapitalized" institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator.
Volcker Rule
The so-called "Volcker Rule" issued under the Dodd-Frank Act, which became effective in July 2015, restricts the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries, including the Bank, to sponsor or invest in private funds or to engage in certain types of proprietary trading. In October 2019, the Federal Reserve, OCC, FDIC, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and SEC finalized rules to tailor the application of the Volcker Rule based on the size and scope of a banking entity's trading activities and to clarify and amend certain definitions, requirements and exemptions. The regulators have also stated their intention to engage in further rulemaking with respect to provisions of the implementing regulations relating to covered funds. The ultimate impact of any amendments to the Volcker Rule will depend on, among other things, further rulemaking and implementation guidance from the relevant U.S. federal regulatory agencies and the development of market practices and standards. The Company generally does not engage in the businesses prohibited by the Volcker Rule; therefore, the Volcker Rule does not have a material effect on the operations of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Illinois Banking Law
The Illinois Banking Act ("IBA") governs the activities of the Bank as an Illinois state-chartered bank. Among other things, the IBA (i) defines the powers and permissible activities of an Illinois state-chartered bank, (ii) prescribes certain corporate governance standards, (iii) imposes approval requirements on merger and acquisition activity of Illinois state banks, (iv) prescribes lending limits, and (v) provides for the examination and supervision of state banks by the IDFPR. The Banking on Illinois Act ("BIA") amended the IBA to provide a wide range of new activities allowed for Illinois state-chartered banks, including the Bank. The provisions of the BIA are to be construed liberally to create a favorable business climate for banks in Illinois. The main features of the BIA are to expand bank powers through a "wild card" provision that authorizes Illinois state-chartered banks to offer virtually any product or service that any bank or thrift may offer anywhere in the country, subject to restrictions imposed on those other banks and thrifts, certain safety and soundness considerations, and prior notification to the IDFPR and the FDIC.
Dividends and Repurchases
The Company's primary source of liquidity is dividend payments from the Bank. In addition to requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums, the Bank is limited in the amount of dividends it can pay to the Company under the IBA. Under the IBA, the Bank is permitted to declare and pay dividends in amounts up to the amount of its accumulated net profits, provided that it retains in its surplus at least one-tenth of its net profits since the date of the declaration of its most recent dividend until those additions to surplus, in the aggregate, equal the paid-in capital of the Bank. While it continues its banking business, the Bank may not pay dividends in excess of its net profits then on hand (after deductions for losses and bad debts). In addition, the Bank is limited in the amount of dividends it can pay under the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation H. For example, dividends cannot be paid that would constitute a withdrawal of capital, dividends cannot be declared or paid if they exceed a bank's undivided profits, and a bank may not declare or pay a dividend if all dividends declared during the calendar year are greater than current year net income plus retained net income of the prior two years without Federal Reserve approval.
Since the Company is a legal entity, separate and distinct from the Bank, its dividends to stockholders are not subject to the bank dividend guidelines discussed above. However, the Company is subject to other regulatory policies and requirements related to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums. The Federal Reserve and the IDFPR are authorized to determine that the payment of dividends by the Company would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment under certain circumstances related to the financial condition of a bank or bank holding company. The Federal Reserve has taken the position that dividends that would create pressure or undermine the safety and soundness of a subsidiary bank are inappropriate. Additionally, it is Federal Reserve policy that bank holding companies generally should pay dividends on common stock only out of net income available to common shareholders over the past year and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization's current and expected future capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.
The Capital Simplification Rules adopted in July 2019 eliminated the standalone prior approval requirement in the Basel III Capital Rules for any repurchase of common stock. In certain circumstances, the Company's repurchases of its common stock may be subject to a prior approval or notice requirement under other regulations or policies of the Federal Reserve. Any redemption or repurchase of preferred stock or subordinated debt remains subject to the prior approval of the Federal Reserve.
FDIC Insurance Premiums
The Bank's deposits are insured through the DIF, which is administered by the FDIC. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, FDIC-insured institutions. It may also prohibit any FDIC-insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the DIF. Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution engaged or is engaging in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order, or condition imposed by the FDIC or written agreement entered into with the FDIC.
FDIC assessment rates for large institutions that have more than $10 billion of assets, such as the Bank, are calculated based on a "scorecard" methodology that seeks to capture both the probability that an individual large institution will fail and the magnitude of the impact on the DIF if such a failure occurs, based primarily on the difference between the institution's average of total assets and average tangible equity. The FDIC has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score, up or down, based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the scorecard. For large institutions, including the Bank, after accounting for potential base-rate adjustments, the total assessment rate could range from 1.5 to 40 basis points on an annualized basis. An institution's assessment is determined by multiplying its assessment rate by its assessment base, which is asset based.
Depositor Preference 
The FDIA provides that, in the event of the "liquidation or other resolution" of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over the other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including depositors whose deposits are payable only outside of the U.S. and the bank holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution. 
Employee Incentive Compensation
In 2010, the Federal Reserve, along with the other federal banking agencies, issued guidance applying to all banking organizations that requires that their incentive compensation policies be consistent with safety and soundness principles. Under this guidance, financial organizations must review their compensation programs to ensure that they: (i) provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and reward and that do not encourage imprudent risk, (ii) are compatible with effective controls and risk management, and (iii) are supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the banking organization's board of directors. Monitoring methods and processes used by a banking organization should be commensurate with the size and complexity of the organization and its use of incentive compensation.
During the second quarter of 2016, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal bank regulatory agencies and the SEC proposed revised rules on incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion of total assets (including the Company and the Bank). These proposed rules have not been finalized.
Cybersecurity
The federal banking agencies have established certain expectations with respect to an institution's information security and cybersecurity programs, with an increasing focus on risk management, processes related to information technology and operational resiliency, and the use of third-parties in the provision of financial services. In October 2016, the federal banking agencies jointly issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced cybersecurity risk-management and resilience standards that would address five categories of cyber standards which include (i) cyber risk governance, (ii) cyber risk management, (iii) internal dependency management, (iv) external dependency management, and (v) incident response, cyber resilience, and situational awareness. As proposed, these enhanced standards would apply only to depository institutions and depository institution holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more; however, it is possible that if these enhanced standards are implemented, even if the $50 billion threshold is increased, the Federal Reserve will consider them in connection with the examination and supervision of banks below the $50 billion threshold. The federal banking agencies have not yet taken further action on these proposed standards. 
State regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. Recently, several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs, including data encryption requirements. Many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements. We expect this trend of state-level activity in those areas to continue, and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which the Company operates.
In February 2018, the SEC published interpretive guidance to assist public companies in preparing disclosures about cybersecurity risks and incidents. These SEC guidelines, and any other regulatory guidance, are in addition to notification and disclosure requirements under state and federal banking law and regulations.
Future Legislation and Regulation
In addition to the specific legislation and regulations described above, various laws and regulations are being considered by federal and state governments and regulatory agencies that may change banking statutes and the Company's operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways and may increase reporting requirements and compliance costs. These changes could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities, or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions in ways that could adversely affect the Company.
