ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Summary Description of Businesses
Formed in 1902, L.B. Foster Company is a Pennsylvania corporation with its principal office in Pittsburgh, PA. L.B. Foster Company provides products and services for the rail industry and solutions to support critical infrastructure projects. The Company’s innovative engineering and product development solutions inspire the safety, reliability, and performance of its customer’s challenging requirements. The Company maintains locations in North America, Europe, and Asia. As used herein, “L.B. Foster,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” or similar references refer collectively to L.B. Foster Company and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.
For the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2020, the Company realigned its operating segments under two senior business leaders to provide clear line of sight around the opportunities for growth and asset leverage in each of the two segments. L.B. Foster’s business portfolio and external business segment reporting structure will be consolidated into two primary segments: Rail Technologies and Services and Infrastructure Solutions. The Rail Technologies and Services segment will consist of businesses previously positioned within the Rail Products and Services segment. The Infrastructure Solutions segment will combine all businesses previously within the legacy Construction Products and Tubular and Energy Services segments. Each segment will report to a business line executive that will have responsibility for the segment’s performance.
The following table shows the net sales generated by each business segment as a percentage of total net sales for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:

 | Percentage of Net Sales
 | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018
Rail Technologies and Services | 56 | % | | 52 | % | 55 | %
Infrastructure Solutions | 44 | | | 48 | | 45 | 
 | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

Financial information concerning these segments is set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated by reference into this Item 1.
Rail Technologies and Services
The Company’s Rail Technologies and Services (“Rail”) segment is comprised of several manufacturing, distribution, and service businesses that provide a variety of products, solutions, and services for freight and passenger railroads and industrial companies throughout the world. The Rail segment has sales offices throughout North America and Europe, and works on rail projects where it offers products manufactured by the Company, or sourced from numerous supply chain partners, and also offers aftermarket services. The Rail segment is comprised of the Rail Technologies and Rail Products business units.
Rail Technologies
The Company’s Rail Technologies business unit engineers, manufactures, and fabricates friction management products and application systems, railroad condition monitoring systems and equipment, wheel impact load detection systems, wayside data collection and management systems, and also provides aftermarket services. The Company’s friction management products control the friction at the rail/wheel interface and help our customers reduce fuel consumption, improve operating efficiencies, extend the life of operating assets such as rail and wheels, reduce track stresses, and lower the related maintenance and operating costs. Friction management products include mobile and wayside systems that apply lubricants and liquid or solid friction modifiers. In addition, the business unit provides controls, display, and telecommunication solutions for the transit, control room, and customer information and display sectors. These products and systems are designed, engineered, manufactured, fabricated, serviced, and marketed by certain wholly-owned subsidiaries located in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), and Germany.
Rail Products
The Rail Products business is comprised of the Company’s Rail Distribution, Allegheny Rail Products, Transit Products, Track Components, and Concrete Tie divisions. Following are summaries of those divisions:
Rail Distribution - This division sells new rail mainly to passenger and short line freight railroads, industrial companies, and rail contractors for the replacement of existing lines or expansion of new lines. Rail accessories sold by the Rail Distribution division include track spikes, bolts, angle bars, tie plates, and other products required to install or maintain rail lines. These products are manufactured by the Company or purchased from other manufacturers and distributed accordingly. Rail Distribution also sells trackwork products to Class II and III railroads, industrial, and export markets.
Allegheny Rail Products (“ARP”) - ARP engineers and manufactures insulated rail joints and related accessories for freight and passenger railroads and industrial customers. Insulated joints are manufactured domestically at the Company’s facilities in Pueblo, CO and Niles, OH.
Transit Products - This division supplies designed, engineered, and outsourced manufactured direct fixation fasteners, coverboards, and special accessories primarily for passenger railroad systems, and manufactures power rail, also known as third rail, at its facility in Niles, OH. These products are usually sold to contractors or by sealed bid to passenger railroads.
Track Components - The Track Components division manufactures track spikes and anchors at the Company’s facility in St. Jean Richelieu, Quebec.
Concrete Ties - This division manufactures engineered concrete railroad ties for freight and passenger railroads and industrial accounts at its facility in Spokane, WA.
Infrastructure Solutions
The Infrastructure Solutions segment is comprised of several manufacturing, distribution, and service businesses that provide a variety of products and services for the transportation, energy, and general infrastructure markets, primarily in North America. The Infrastructure Solutions segment is composed of the Precast Concrete Products, Fabricated Steel Products, and Coatings and Measurement business units.
Precast Concrete Products
The Precast Concrete Products business unit primarily manufactures concrete buildings for national, state, and municipal parks. This business unit manufactures restrooms, concession stands, and other protective storage buildings available in multiple designs, textures, and colors. The Company is a leading high-end supplier in terms of volume, product options, and capabilities. This business unit also manufactures various other precast products such as sounds walls, burial vaults, bridge beams, box culverts, septic tanks, and other custom pre-stressed and precast concrete products. The products are manufactured in Boise, ID, Hillsboro, TX, and Waverly, WV. The Company commenced precast product operations at its new facility located in Boise, ID, in the first quarter of 2020. This move is part of an initiative focusing on regional growth opportunities and logistical savings associated with fabricating products in a more centralized location closer to the Company’s existing and prospective customer base.
Fabricated Steel Products
The Fabricated Steel Products business unit provides fabricated bridge products and piling to infrastructure end markets. The Fabricated Steel Products business unit, via a sales force deployed throughout the United States, markets and sells products both domestically and internationally. Following are summaries of those product offerings:
Fabricated Bridge Products - The fabricated bridge products facility in Bedford, PA manufactures a number of fabricated steel and aluminum products primarily for the highway, bridge, and transit industries, including concrete reinforced steel grid deck, open steel grid deck, aluminum bridge railing, and stay-in-place steel bridge forms.
Piling Products - Sheet piling products are interlocking structural steel sections that are generally used to provide lateral support at construction sites. Bearing piling products are steel H-beam sections which are driven into the ground for support of structures such as bridge piers and high-rise buildings. Piling is often used in water and land applications, including cellular cofferdams and OPEN CELL® structures in inland river systems and ports.
Piling products are sourced from various manufacturers and either sold or rented to project owners and contractors. This business unit offers its customers various types and dimensions of structural beam piling, sheet piling, and pipe piling. The Company is a preferred distributor of domestic PZC steel sheet piling for its primary supplier.
Coatings and Measurement
The Coatings and Measurement business unit provides protective coating services, threaded pipe, and precision measurement products to infrastructure end markets. The following is a summary of those product and service offerings: 
Protective Coatings - There are two pipeline services locations that make up our Protective Coatings division. Our Birmingham, AL facility coats the outside and inside diameter of pipe primarily for oil and gas transmission pipelines. This location partners with its primary customer, a pipe manufacturer, to market fusion bonded epoxy coatings, abrasion resistant coatings, and internal linings for a wide variety of pipe diameters for use in pipeline projects throughout North America.
The second location is located in Willis, TX. The Willis, TX facility applies specialty outside and inside diameter coatings for a wide variety of pipe diameters for oil and gas transmission, mining, and waste water pipelines, as well as provides custom coatings for specialty pipe fittings and connections.
Threaded Products - The Company’s Magnolia, TX facility cuts, threads, and paints pipe primarily for water well applications for the agriculture industry and municipal water authorities and, to a lesser extent, threading services for the Oil Country Tubular Goods markets.
Precision Measurement Products and Systems - The Company manufactures and provides turnkey solutions for metering and injection systems for the oil, and, to a lesser extent, gas industry. The Willis, TX location operates a fabrication plant that builds metering systems for custody transfer applications, including crude oil and other petroleum-based products. These systems are used at well sites, pipelines, refineries, chemical plants, and loading/unloading facilities. The Willis,TX location also manufactures and installs additive and dye injection systems. These systems are used to inject performance additives and/or dyes into petroleum products.
Marketing and Competition
L.B. Foster Company generally markets its Rail Technologies and Services directly in all major industrial areas of the United States, Canada, and Europe. Infrastructure Solutions is primarily marketed domestically. The Company employs a sales force of approximately 89 people that is supplemented with a network of agents across Europe, South America, and Asia to reach current customers and cultivate potential customers in these areas. For the years ended 2020, 2019, and 2018, approximately 20%, 20%, and 24%, respectively, of the Company’s total sales were outside the United States.
The major markets for the Company’s products are highly competitive. Product availability, quality, service, and price are principal factors of competition within each of these markets. No other company provides the same product mix to the various markets the Company serves. However, there are one or more companies that compete with the Company in each product line. Therefore, the Company faces significant competition from different groups of companies.
Raw Materials and Supplies
Most of the Company’s products are purchased in the form of finished or semi-finished products. The Company purchases the majority of its supplies from domestic and foreign steel producers. Generally, the Company has a number of vendor options. However, the Company has an arrangement with a steel mill to distribute steel sheet piling in North America. Should sheet piling from its present supplier not be available for any reason, the Company risks not being able to provide such product to its customers.
The Company’s purchases from foreign suppliers are subject to foreign currency exchange rate changes and the usual risks associated with changes in international conditions, as well as United States and international laws that could impose import restrictions on selected classes of products and for anti-dumping duties if products are sold in the United States at prices that are below specified prices.
Backlog
The Company’s backlog represents the sales price of received customer purchase orders or contracts in which the performance obligations have not been met, and therefore are precluded from revenue recognition. Although the Company believes that the orders included in backlog are firm, customers may cancel or change their orders with limited advance notice; however, these instances are rare. Backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company’s ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance. The backlog as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 by business segment was as follows:

 | December 31,
 | 2020 | | 2019
Rail Technologies and Services | $ | 121,231 | | | $ | 103,694
Infrastructure Solutions | 127,001 | | | 125,338 | 
Total | $ | 248,232 | | | $ | 229,032

Approximately 13.4% of the December 31, 2020 backlog was related to projects that is expected to extend beyond 2021.
Patents and Trademarks
The Company owns a number of domestic and international patents and trademarks, primarily related to its Rail Technologies products. The Company’s business segments are not dependent upon any individual patents or related group of patents, nor any individual licenses or distribution rights. The Company believes that, in the aggregate, the rights under its patents, trademarks, and licenses are generally important to its operations, but considers neither any individual patent, nor any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product, to be of material importance in relation to its total business.
Environmental Disclosures
Information regarding environmental matters is included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated by reference into this Item 1.

Health and Safety
L.B. Foster promotes a culture of environmental, health, safety, and sustainability (“EHSS”) excellence that strives to protect the environment as well as the safety and health of our employees, business, customers, and communities where we operate. The Company is committed to meet or exceed the requirements of all applicable environmental, health and safety (“EHS”) regulations as the Company raises its standards of excellence.

Leadership and Talent Management
The Company’s executive leadership team sets the Company’s strategic direction and is dedicated to sustainable profitable growth through its commitment to providing quality products and services to its customers and treating our customers, suppliers, and employees as partners. L.B. Foster cultivates and empowers talent through performance management, career planning/development, and succession planning, creating an environment for people to be successful in achieving our strategic plan through the following areas:
Talent Acquisition and Onboarding
The process of finding and hiring the best-qualified candidate (from within or outside of the organization) for a job opening, in a timely and cost-effective manner. The recruitment process includes analyzing the requirements of a job, meeting with hiring management to determine the appropriate qualifications and experience for the position, attracting qualified candidates to that job, providing opportunities to advance diversity in the workforce, screening and selecting applicants, hiring, and ultimately integrating the new employee to the organization.
Development Planning
The proactive planning and implementation of action steps towards our employees’ career goals. Developmental experiences can consist of training, developing, mentoring, and coaching.
Succession Planning
A process for identifying and developing employees with the potential to fill key business leadership positions within the Company are key to future success. Succession planning increases the availability of experienced and capable employees that are prepared to assume these critical roles as they become available.
Performance Management
An ongoing process of communication between a supervisor and an employee that occurs throughout the year, in support of accomplishing the strategic objectives of the organization.
Workforce
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately 1,130 employees, 774 located within the United States, 71 within Canada, and 285 in Europe. There were 624 hourly production workers and 506 salaried employees. Of the hourly production workers, approximately 92 were represented by unions.
Three collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 34, 29, and 29 employees are scheduled to expire in March 2025, August 2021, and September 2021, respectively. As a result of the Company’s relocation of the concrete products operations from Spokane, WA to Boise, ID, a separation agreement was executed with the collective bargaining unit representing the employees affected by this relocation. This agreement had no impact on the employees under the same collective bargaining agreement at the concrete tie operation in Spokane, WA. The Company has not suffered any major work stoppages during the past five years and considers its relations with its employees to be satisfactory.
All of the Company’s hourly paid employees are covered by one of the Company’s defined benefit plans or defined contribution plans. All of the Company’s salaried employees are similarly covered by one of the Company’s defined benefit or defined contribution plans.
