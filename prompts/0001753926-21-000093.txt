Our Growth Strategy
 
In addition to growing the customer base of Touchpoint, we will look at growth through the following methods:
 
Growing through acquisitions:    We believe that the highly fragmented content creation media industry, which is comprised primarily of small-to-medium-sized private companies, provides us with significant opportunities to grow our business through acquisitions. We intend to pursue acquisitions that provide services within our current core product offerings, extend our geographic reach and expand our product offerings.
 
Cross-selling services:    Our ability to produce diverse, engaging content across various media platforms allows us to offer clients a one-stop-shop for all of their content needs. We intend to cross-sell our various capabilities to drive additional revenue from existing clients and to seek to win new clients.
 
Expanding our geographic presence:    We believe that by expanding our physical presence into select international regions, we will be better able to attract and retain internationally based brands as clients. With a physical presence outside of the U.S., we believe we can provide better customer service and offer local talent who can work more intimately with internationally based brands than we can from our offices in the U.S.
 
Expanding our talent roster:    We intend to continue to seek to attract and retain world-class creative and technical talent, thereby increasing our ability to win jobs and build brand equity through additional high quality creative content. We believe that our reputation and our client base will allow us to continue to attract top creative talent.
