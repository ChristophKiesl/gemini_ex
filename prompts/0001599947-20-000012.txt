Item 1. Business.
Overview
TerraForm Power acquires, owns, and operates solar and wind assets in North America and Western Europe. We are the owner and operator of over 4,100 MW diversified portfolio of high-quality solar and wind assets underpinned by long-term contracts. Significant diversity across technologies and locations coupled with contracts across a large, diverse group of creditworthy counterparties significantly reduces the impact of resource variability on cash available for distribution and limits our exposure to any individual counterparty. We are sponsored by Brookfield Asset Management Inc. (“Brookfield”), a leading global alternative asset manager with over $540 billion in assets under management. Affiliates of Brookfield held approximately 62% of TerraForm Power’s Class A common stock (“Common Stock”) as of December 31, 2019.
TerraForm Power’s objective is to deliver an attractive risk-adjusted return to its stockholders. We expect to generate this total return with a regular distribution, which we intend to grow at 5 to 8% per annum, that is backed by stable cash flows.
TerraForm Power, formed in 2014, is a holding company and its primary asset is an equity interest in TerraForm Power, LLC (“Terra LLC”). TerraForm Power is the managing member of Terra LLC and operates, controls and consolidates the business affairs of Terra LLC. Unless otherwise indicated or otherwise required by the context, references to “we,” “our,” “us” or the “Company” refer to TerraForm Power and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Brookfield Renewable Non-Binding Proposal and Signing of Reorganization Agreement
On January 11, 2020, the Company received an unsolicited and non-binding proposal (the “Brookfield Proposal”) from Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. (“Brookfield Renewable”), an affiliate of Brookfield, to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company, other than the approximately 62% shares held by Brookfield and its affiliates. The Brookfield Proposal expressly conditioned the transaction contemplated thereby on the approval of a committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) consisting solely of independent directors and the approval of a majority of the shares held by the Company’s stockholders not affiliated with Brookfield Renewable and its affiliates. Following the Company’s receipt of the Brookfield Proposal, the Board formed a special committee (the “Special Committee”) of non-executive, disinterested and independent directors to, among other things, review, evaluate and consider the Brookfield Proposal and, if the Special Committee deemed appropriate, negotiate a transaction with Brookfield Renewable or explore alternatives thereto. The Board resolutions establishing the Special Committee expressly provided that the Board would not approve the transaction contemplated by the Brookfield Proposal or any alternative thereto without a prior favorable recommendation by the Special Committee. Brookfield Renewable holds an approximately 30% indirect economic interest in TerraForm Power.
On March 16, 2020, pursuant to the Brookfield Proposal, the Company and Brookfield Renewable and certain of their affiliates entered into a definitive agreement (the “Reorganization Agreement”) for Brookfield Renewable to acquire all of the Company's outstanding shares of Common Stock, other than the 62% currently owned by Brookfield Renewable and its affiliates (the transactions contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement, the “Transactions”). Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, each holder of a share of Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of the Transactions will receive, at each such shareholder’s election, 0.381 of a Brookfield Renewable limited partnership unit or of a Class A exchangeable subordinate voting share of Brookfield Renewable Corporation, a Canadian subsidiary of Brookfield Renewable which is expected to be publicly listed as of the consummation of the Transactions. The Special Committee has unanimously recommended that the Company’s unaffiliated shareholders approve the Transactions. Consummation of the Transactions is subject to the non-waivable approval of a majority of the Company’s shareholders not affiliated with Brookfield Renewable, receipt of required regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
Our principal executive offices are located at 200 Liberty Street, 14th Floor, New York, New York 10281, and our telephone number is 646-992-2400. Our website address is www.terraformpower.com.

The diagram below is a summary depiction of our organizational and capital structure as of December 31, 2019:

 —————
(1)As of December 31, 2019, there were 226,500,807 shares of Common Stock outstanding. Orion US Holdings 1 L.P. (“Orion Holdings”) and BBHC Orion Holdco L.P. (“BBHC Holdings”), each controlled affiliates of Brookfield, together owned approximately 62% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock as of December 31, 2019. Brookfield Renewable, through its ownership interest in Orion Holdings and BBHC Holdings, has an approximately 30% indirect economic interest in TerraForm Power.
(2)Incentive Distribution Rights (“IDRs”) represent a variable interest in distributions by Terra LLC and therefore, cannot be expressed as a fixed percentage ownership interest in Terra LLC. BRE Delaware, Inc., an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Brookfield (“Brookfield IDR Holder”), holds all of the IDRs of Terra LLC. See Incentive Distribution Rights within Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the IDRs.
(3)See Liquidity and Capital Resources within Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for discussion regarding these financing arrangements.

There were no revolving loans drawn under the Revolver as of December 31, 2019.
(6)Certain project-level holding companies are guarantors of the indebtedness of Terra Operating LLC. These project-level holding companies do not have any indebtedness.
Our Business Strategy
Our primary business strategy is to acquire, own and operate solar and wind assets in North America and Western Europe. We are the owner and operator of over 4,100 MW diversified portfolio of high-quality solar and wind assets, underpinned by long-term contracts. Significant diversity across technologies and locations coupled with contracts across a large, diverse group of creditworthy counterparties significantly reduces the impact of resource variability on cash available for distribution and limits our exposure to any individual counterparty. We are sponsored by Brookfield.
Our goal is to pay distributions to our stockholders that are sustainable on a long-term basis while retaining within our operations sufficient liquidity for recurring capital expenditures, and general corporate purposes. We expect to generate this return with a regular distribution, which we intend to grow at 5 to 8% per annum, supported by a target payout ratio of 80 to 85% of CAFD and our stable cash flows. We expect to achieve this growth and deliver returns by focusing on the following initiatives:
•Value-Oriented Acquisitions:
With the support of Brookfield, we focus on sourcing off-market transactions at more attractive valuations than auction processes. We believe that multi-faceted transactions such as take-privates and recapitalizations may enable us to acquire high quality assets at attractive relative values.
We have a right of first offer (“ROFO”) to acquire certain renewable power assets in North America and Western Europe owned by Brookfield and its affiliates. The ROFO portfolio currently stands at approximately 3,500 MW. Over time, as Brookfield entities look to sell these assets, we will have the opportunity to make offers for these assets and potentially purchase them if the proposed price (i) meets our investment objectives, and (ii) is the most favorable offered to Brookfield and the applicable Brookfield entities receive all necessary approvals from their independent directors and institutional partners. We also continue to maintain a call right over 500 MW (net) of operating wind power plants that are owned by a warehouse vehicle that was owned and arranged by our previous sponsor, SunEdison, Inc. (“SunEdison”), who sold its equity interest in this warehouse vehicle to an unaffiliated third party in 2017.
•Margin Enhancements:
We have sought to enhance our cash flow by optimizing the performance of our existing assets. As our long-term service agreements (collectively, the “LTSA”) for our North American and European wind fleets and North American solar fleet demonstrate, such agreements have the potential to lock in cost savings, provide contractual incentives for achieving our generation targets and increase revenue through deployment of technology. 
•Organic Growth:
We continue to develop a robust organic growth pipeline of opportunities to invest in our existing fleet on an accretive basis as well as add-on acquisitions across our scope of operations. At any given time we seek to have a number of investment opportunities, including asset repowerings, site expansions and adding energy storage to existing sites.
We benefit from Brookfield’s deep operational expertise in owning, operating and developing renewable assets, as well as its significant deal-sourcing capabilities and access to capital. Brookfield is a leading global alternative asset manager and has a more than 100-year history of owning and operating assets with a focus on renewable power, property, infrastructure and private equity. Brookfield has over $540 billion of assets under management of which $50 billion are renewable power assets. Brookfield’s renewable power portfolio represents approximately 19,000 MW of generation capacity in 17 countries. It also employs over 2,800 individuals with extensive operating, development and power marketing capabilities and has a demonstrated ability to deploy capital in a disciplined manner.
Sponsorship Arrangements
On October 16, 2017, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orion Holdings, an affiliate of Brookfield, merged with and into TerraForm Power (the “Merger”), with TerraForm Power continuing as the surviving corporation. In connection with the consummation of the Merger, TerraForm Power entered into the following suite of support and sponsorship arrangements (the “Sponsorship Transaction”) with Brookfield and certain of its affiliates:
•Master Services Agreement (the “Brookfield MSA”), with Brookfield, certain of Brookfield’s affiliates, Terra LLC and Terra Operating LLC, pursuant to which Brookfield and certain of its affiliates provide certain management and 
administrative services, including the provision of strategic and investment management services, to TerraForm Power and its subsidiaries.
•Relationship Agreement (the “Relationship Agreement”) with Brookfield, Terra LLC and Terra Operating LLC, which governs certain aspects of the relationship between Brookfield and TerraForm Power and its subsidiaries. Pursuant to the Relationship Agreement, TerraForm Power and its subsidiaries serve as the primary vehicle through which Brookfield and its affiliates acquire operating solar and wind assets in certain countries in North America and Western Europe, and Brookfield grants TerraForm Power a ROFO on any proposed transfer of certain existing projects and all future operating solar and wind projects located in such countries developed by persons sponsored by or under the control of Brookfield, subject to certain exceptions and consent rights set out therein. See Item 1A. Risk Factors. Risks Related to our Relationship with Brookfield.
•Governance Agreement (the “Governance Agreement”) with Orion Holdings and any controlled affiliate of Brookfield (other than TerraForm Power and its controlled affiliates) (such controlled affiliates together with Brookfield, the “Sponsor Group”) that by the terms of the Governance Agreement from time to time becomes a party thereto. The Governance Agreement establishes certain rights and obligations of TerraForm Power and members of the Sponsor Group that own voting securities of TerraForm Power relating to the governance of TerraForm Power.
Terra LLC is also party to an amended and restated limited liability company agreement with Brookfield IDR Holder, and a $500.0 million sponsor line of credit (the “Sponsor Line”) with Brookfield and one of its affiliates as discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources within Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. See also a discussion of the IDRs in Incentive Distribution Rights within Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Corporate Governance and Management
We have a single class of shares outstanding worth one vote each. The size of our Board is currently set at seven members, of whom four are designated by Brookfield and three are independent. Under the terms of the Governance Agreement, Brookfield appoints our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel for as long as the Brookfield MSA remains in effect. These three executive officers are not employees of TerraForm Power and their services are provided pursuant to the Brookfield MSA.
Our Board has established an Audit Committee and a Conflicts Committee, each consisting entirely of independent Directors. The Conflicts Committee considers, among other things, matters in which a conflict of interest exists between TerraForm Power and Brookfield. Our Board has also established a Nominating and Governance Committee, which consists of three Directors, one of whom is a Director designated by Brookfield and two of whom are independent Directors. Our Board also in December 2020 formed a Special Committee consisting entirely of independent Directors to, among other things, review, evaluate and consider the Brookfield Proposal.

Seasonality and Resource Availability
The amount of electricity produced and revenues generated by our solar generation facilities is dependent, in part, on the amount of sunlight, or irradiation, where the assets are located. As shorter daylight hours in the winter months result in less irradiation, the electricity generated by these facilities varies depending on the season. Irradiation can also be variable at a particular location from period to period due to weather or other meteorological patterns, which can affect operating results. As the majority of our solar power facilities are located in the Northern Hemisphere, we expect our solar portfolio’s power generation and revenue to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each year.
Similarly, the electricity produced and revenues generated by our wind power plants depend heavily on wind conditions, which are variable and difficult to predict. Operating results for wind power plants vary significantly from period to period depending on the wind conditions during the periods in question. As our wind power plants are located in geographies with different weather conditions, there is some flattening of the seasonal variability associated with each individual wind power plant’s generation, and we expect that as the fleet expands the effect of such wind resource variability may be favorably impacted, although we cannot guarantee that we will purchase wind power facilities that will achieve such results in part or at all. Historically, our wind production has been greater in the first and fourth quarters which can partially offset any lower solar revenues in those quarters.
We do not expect seasonality to have a material effect on our ability to pay a regular distribution. We intend to mitigate the effects of any seasonality that we experience by maintaining sufficient liquidity in order to, among other things, facilitate the payment of distributions to our stockholders. 
Competition
Power generation is a capital-intensive business with numerous industry participants. We compete to acquire new renewable energy facilities with renewable energy developers, independent power producers, financial investors and certain utilities. We compete to supply energy to our potential customers with utilities and other distributed generation providers. We compete with renewable energy owners and developers, independent power producers, financial investors, utilities and distributed generation providers based on our cost of capital, operating expertise, pipeline, global footprint and brand reputation. To the extent we re-contract renewable energy facilities upon termination of a PPA or sell electricity into the merchant power market, we compete with traditional utilities and other independent power producers primarily based on cost of capital, asset location, the feasibility of customer sited generation, operations and management expertise, price (including predictability of price), the ability to monetize green attributes (such as RECs and tax incentives) of renewable power and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our renewable energy facilities. In our merchant power sales, we also compete with other types of generation resources, including gas and coal-fired power plants.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we own and operate renewable energy facilities. These laws and regulations generally require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained and maintained both before construction and during operation of these renewable energy facilities. We incur costs in the ordinary course of business to comply with these laws, regulations and permit requirements. We do not anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental compliance for our renewable energy facilities in the next several years. While we do not expect that the costs of compliance would generally have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations, it is possible that as the size of our portfolio grows we may become subject to new or modified regulatory regimes that may impose unanticipated requirements on our business as a whole that were not anticipated with respect to any individual renewable energy facility. Additionally, environmental laws and regulations frequently change and often become more stringent, or subject to more stringent interpretation or enforcement, and therefore future changes could require us to incur materially higher costs which could have a material negative impact on our financial performance or results of operations.
Regulatory Matters
United States
All of the renewable energy facilities located in the United States that we own are qualifying small power production facilities (“QFs”) as defined under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended (“PURPA”) or “eligible facilities” of Exempt Wholesale Generators (“EWGs”) as defined under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, as amended (“PUHCA”). As a result, they and their upstream owners may be entitled to certain exemptions from federal and state regulation. Depending upon the power production capacity of the renewable energy facility in question, our QFs and their immediate project company owners may be entitled to various exemptions from wholesale ratemaking and certain other regulatory provisions of the Federal Power Act, as amended (“FPA”), and from state ratemaking, organizational and financial regulation of electric utilities. Our EWGs must be engaged exclusively in the business of owning and/or operating generating facilities and selling electric energy at wholesale and are subject to regulation for most purposes as “public utilities” under the FPA. 
All of the renewable energy facility companies that we own outside of the United States are Foreign Utility Companies (“FUCOs”), as defined in PUHCA. They are exempt from state organizational and financial regulation of electric utilities, regulation under the FPA and from most provisions of PUHCA. The upstream owners of only QFs, EWGs, or FUCOs are exempt from the federal regulation under PUHCA. 
In addition to QFs, EWGs, and FUCOs, we own certain fuel cell project companies that engage exclusively in retail energy sales. These project companies are not subject to regulation under the FPA; however, they are “electric utility companies” under PUHCA. We have obtained an exemption from federal regulation under PUHCA predicated on specific facts and representations made to FERC. In the event that we no longer qualify for such exemption, we could become subject to the federal books and access provisions of PUHCA and FERC’s record-keeping, accounting, and reporting obligations under PUHCA.
We own a number of renewable energy facility companies in the United States that are “public utilities” subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”), and that have obtained “market-based rate authorization” and associated blanket authorizations and waivers from FERC pursuant to the FPA, which allows such companies to sell electricity, capacity and ancillary services at wholesale at negotiated market based rates, instead of cost-of-service rates. These companies have been granted waivers of, and blanket authorizations under, certain FERC regulations that are commonly granted to market-based rate sellers, including blanket authorizations to issue securities and assume liabilities. FERC generally authorizes a company to charge market-based rates as long as the company can demonstrate that it does not have, or has adequately mitigated, market power and it cannot otherwise erect barriers to market entry. Currently, none of our project companies has been found by FERC to have the potential to exercise market power in any U.S. markets. In the event that FERC’s analysis of market power changes, or if certain other conditions of market-based rate authority are not met, FERC has the authority to impose mitigation measures or withhold or rescind market-based rate authority and require sales to be made based on cost-of-service rates, which could result in a reduction in rates. FERC requires market-based rate holders to submit quarterly reports of their wholesale sales and make additional compliance filings upon certain triggering events in order to maintain market-based rate authority. The failure to make timely filings can result in revocation or suspension of market-based rate authority, refunds of revenues previously collected and the imposition of civil penalties. FERC has authority to assess substantial civil penalties (i.e. up to approximately $1.3 million per day per violation) for failure to comply with the conditions of market-based rate authority as well as other requirements of the FPA and PUHCA.
Under Section 203 of the FPA (“FPA Section 203”), prior authorization by FERC is generally required for any direct or indirect change in control over, or merger or consolidation with, a “public utility,” facilities subject to FERC’s jurisdiction, or in certain circumstances an “electric utility company” or a “transmitting utility,” as such terms are used for purposes of FPA Section 203. All of our renewable energy facility companies that sell their output at wholesale in the continental U.S. (except our Wind power plants in Texas) and our subsidiary Evergreen Gen Lead, LLC (which owns electric transmission facilities) are subject to FERC’s jurisdiction under FPA Section 203. FERC generally presumes that the transfer of a 10% or greater direct or indirect voting interest in an entity results in a change in control of such entity for purposes of FPA Section 203. Transfers of interconnection and transmission facilities associated with our electric generation facilities and transfers of existing generation facilities could also trigger the need to obtain prior approval from FERC under FPA Section 203. Violation of FPA Section 203 can result in civil or criminal liability under the FPA, including civil penalties, and the possible imposition of other sanctions by FERC. Depending upon the circumstances, liability for violation of FPA Section 203 may attach to the public utility or the upstream holding companies involved in the transaction. 
Certain of our renewable energy facilities are also subject to compliance with the mandatory Reliability Standards promulgated and enforced by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (“NERC”) and approved by FERC. Violation of such Reliability Standards can result in civil penalties or other enforcement measures to ensure compliance under the FPA assessed to the owners and/or operators of such renewable energy facilities. In the United Kingdom, Canada, Chile, Uruguay, Portugal and Spain, we are also generally subject to the regulations of the relevant energy regulatory agencies applicable to all producers of electricity under the relevant feed-in tariff or other governmental incentive programs (collectively “FIT”) (including the FIT rates); however, it is generally not subject to regulation as a traditional public utility, i.e., regulation of our financial organization and rates other than FIT rates.
As the size of our portfolio grows, or as applicable rules and regulations evolve, we may become subject to new or modified regulatory regimes that may impose unanticipated requirements on the business as a whole that were not anticipated with respect to any individual renewable energy facility. For example, the NERC Reliability Standards approved by FERC impose fleetwide cyber security requirements regarding electronic and physical access to generating facilities in order to protect system reliability. Such requirements expand in scope after the point at which a common owner has more than 1,500 MW of reliability assets under its control in a single interconnection area and expand again once the owner has more than 3,000 MW under construction. Similarly, on September 19, 2019, FERC published a notice of proposed rulemaking (“NOPR”) to revise its PURPA regulations for QFs. Of relevance to our QFs, the NOPR proposes to revise (i) the obligation of interconnected utilities to purchase power from renewable QFs under 20 MW and the terms and conditions of such purchases, (ii) the process for third-party challenges to the QF status of self-certified projects, and (iii) the rules used to aggregate and treat as a single facility (for purposes of the 80 MW QF size limit and other exemption thresholds) renewable QFs that use the same fuel source, are owned or operated by the same person or its affiliates, and are located within a certain distance of each other. Such future changes in our regulatory status or the makeup of our fleet could require us to incur materially higher costs, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance or results of operations. Similarly, although we are not currently subject to regulation as an electric utility in the foreign markets in which we provide our renewable energy services, our regulatory position in these markets could change in the future. Any local, state, federal or international regulations could place significant restrictions on our ability to operate our business and execute our business plan by prohibiting or otherwise restricting our ability to sell electricity. If we were deemed to be subject to the same state, federal or foreign regulatory authorities as traditional utility companies, or if new regulatory bodies were established to oversee the renewable energy industry in the United States or in our foreign markets, our operating costs could materially increase, adversely affecting our results of operations.
Spain
The principal revenues generated by our regulated wind and solar assets in Spain are received pursuant to a “regulated return” that is set by Spanish legislation. Pursuant to Royal Decree 413/2014, dated June 6, 2014 (the “Royal Decree 412/2014”), renewable electricity producers in Spain receive two principal payment streams: (i) the pool price for the power they produce; and (ii) a return on investment payment based on the standard investment cost for each type of plant (this second payment is not linked to the amount of power they produce). For certain technologies with a high operational expense (including our solar PV and CSP facilities in Spain), the return on investment is supplemented by a return on operations payment. The principle underpinning this economic regime is that the payments received by a renewable energy producer should be equivalent to the costs that they are unable to recover on the electricity pool market where they compete with non-renewable technologies. This economic regime seeks to allow a “well-run and efficient enterprise” to recover the costs of building and running a plant, plus a “reasonable return” on investment (project investment rate of return) over a regulated standard investment cost for each type of plant defined by the government.
The regulated return rate for the first six-year regulatory period, which ended on December 31, 2019, was 7.39%. In November 2019, the Spanish government issued Royal Decree-Law 17/2019, which set the reasonable return at 7.09% for the next regulatory period (January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2025) for all assets. However, Royal Decree-Law 17/2019 contained an exception for all plants (i) that were commissioned prior to July 2013 and (ii) that did not have any pending litigation against the Kingdom of Spain regarding the prior regulatory change that took place in July 2013. For these excepted assets, Royal Decree-Law 17/2019 maintained 7.39% as the reasonable return for the next two regulatory periods (January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2031). As a result, all of our assets in Spain are entitled to the more favorable regulated rate of 7.39% through December 31, 2031, except for the approximately 45 MW of solar PV assets that we acquired in December 2019 and the approximately 100 MW of CSP assets that we acquired subsequent to year end, each of which are entitled to a reasonable return rate of 7.09% through December 31, 2025. 
Government Incentives and Legislation
Each of the countries in which we operate has established various incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of renewable energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar and wind energy. These incentives include tax credits, cash grants, favorable tax treatment and depreciation, rebates, RECs or green certificates, net energy metering programs, feed-in tariffs and other incentives. These incentives help catalyze private sector investments in renewable energy and efficiency measures. Changes in the government incentives in each of these jurisdictions could have a material impact on our financial performance.
United States
Federal government support for renewable energy
The U.S. federal government provides an investment tax credit that allows a taxpayer to claim a credit of 30% of qualified expenditures for a solar generation facility. The U.S. government’s enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) did not make any changes to the existing laws surrounding tax credits for renewable energy. The ITC is currently scheduled to be reduced to 26% for solar generation facility construction that begins on or after January 1, 2020 and to 22% for solar generation facility construction that begins on or after January 1, 2021. A permanent 10% ITC is available for non-residential solar generation facility construction that begins on or after January 1, 2022. 
Certain wind facilities are eligible for production tax credits, which are federal income tax credits based on the quantity of renewable energy produced and sold during the first ten years of production, or ITCs in lieu of PTCs. These credits are available only for wind power plants that began construction on or prior to December 31, 2020, but are reduced over time. The wind PTCs (and ITC in lieu of PTC) are 100% (of the amount otherwise available) in the case of a facility for which construction began by December 31, 2016, 80% (of the amount otherwise available) in the case of any facility for which construction began in 2017, 60% (of the amount otherwise available) in the case of a facility for which construction begins in 2018, 40% (of the amount otherwise available) in the case of a facility for which construction begins in 2019, and 60% (of the amount otherwise available) in the case of a facility for which construction begins in 2020. ITCs, PTCs and accelerated tax depreciation benefits generated by constructing and operating renewable energy facilities can be monetized by entering into tax equity financing agreements with investors that can utilize the tax benefits, which have been a key financing tool for renewable energy facilities. Based on our portfolio of assets, we will benefit from the ITC, PTC and an accelerated tax depreciation schedule, and we will rely on financing structures that monetize a substantial portion of these benefits and provide financing for our renewable energy facilities.
U.S. state government support for renewable energy
Many states offer a personal and/or corporate investment or production tax credit for renewable energy facilities, which is in addition to the ITC or PTCs. Additionally, more than half of the states, and many local jurisdictions, have established property tax incentives for renewable energy facilities that include exemptions, exclusions, abatements and credits. Certain of our renewable energy facilities in the U.S. have been financed with a tax equity financing structure, whereby the tax equity investor is a member holding equity in the limited liability company that directly or indirectly owns the solar generation facility or wind power plant and receives the benefits of various tax credits.
Many state governments, utilities, municipal utilities and co-operative utilities offer a rebate or other cash incentive for the installation and operation of a renewable energy facility. Capital costs or “up-front” rebates provide funds based on the cost, size or expected production of a customer’s renewable energy facility. Performance-based incentives provide cash payments to a system owner based on the energy generated by their renewable energy facility during a pre-determined period, and they are paid over that time period. Some states also have established FIT programs that are a type of performance-based incentive where the system owner-producer is paid a set rate for the electricity their system generates over a set period of time.
A majority of states have a regulatory policy known as net metering. Net metering typically allows our customers to interconnect their on-site solar generation facilities to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit at the utility’s retail rate for energy generated by their solar generation facility that is exported to the grid. At the end of the billing period, the customer simply pays for the net energy used or receives a credit at the retail rate if more energy is produced than consumed. Some states require utilities to provide net metering to their customers until the total generating capacity of net metered systems exceeds a set percentage of the utilities’ aggregate customer peak demand.
Many states have also adopted procurement requirements for renewable energy production and/or a renewable portfolio standard (“RPS”) that requires regulated utilities to procure a specified percentage of total electricity delivered to customers in the state from eligible renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power generation facilities, by a specified date. To prove compliance with such mandates, utilities must procure and retire RECs. System owners often are able to sell RECs to utilities directly or in REC markets.
U.S. Tax Reform
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted a comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Tax Act made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to, (i) reducing the U.S. federal corporate rate from 35% to 21%; (ii) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings (where applicable) of foreign subsidiaries; (iii) generally eliminating the U.S. federal income tax on distributions received from foreign subsidiaries; (iv) requiring current inclusion in the U.S. federal taxable income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations; (v) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) and changing how existing AMT credits may be realized; (vi) creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax, a new minimum tax; (vii) creating a new limitation on the deductible interest expense; and (viii) changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. The federal corporate tax rate reduction is expected to have a favorable impact on our business but this favorable impact is expected to be offset by a more or less equal negative impact of the interest expense deduction and loss carryforward limitations. The other measures of the Tax Act are not expected to significantly impact our current portfolio.
International
The international markets in which we operate or may operate in the future also typically have in place regimes to promote renewable energy. These mechanisms vary from country to country. Our objective is to grow our distribution through the growth of our portfolio in North America and Western Europe. In seeking to achieve this growth, we may make investments, like our investment in our European platform, that, to some extent, rely on governmental incentives in international jurisdictions. 
In Spain, under Royal Decree 413/2014, renewable electricity producers receive a regulated return set by legislation consisting of two components: (i) the merchant price for the power they produce and (ii) a return on investment payment per MW of installed capacity. For solar plants, there is an additional return on operations payment per MWh produced. This program is intended to allow renewable energy producers to recover development costs and obtain a reasonable rate of return on their investment. The regulated return rate is set every six years. The first six-year regulatory period started on July 14, 2013 and ended on December 31, 2019. In November 2019, the Spanish government approved a new regulated return rate for the second regulatory period, which began on January 1, 2020 and runs through December 31, 2025. See Item 1. Business -Regulatory Matters - Spain. 
In Canada, our portfolio of operating renewable assets is located in the province of Ontario, which has historically sought to increase the contribution of renewables in the supply mix by offering long-term contracts with government-owned entities through competitive requests for proposals or feed-in tariffs. The new Ontario provincial government that took office in June 2018 has since indicated that historic levels of support for renewables will not be sustained in the near term and in December 2019 directed the Independent Electricity System Operator of Ontario to solicit feedback from generators on potential cost-lowering opportunities that would reduce electricity rates for consumers while maintaining grid reliability. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - “Laws, governmental regulations and policies supporting renewable energy, and specifically solar and wind energy (including tax incentives), could change at any time, including as a result of new political leadership, and such changes may materially adversely affect our business and our growth strategy.”
In Portugal, there are feed-in tariff contracts that fix payment terms for the duration of the contract. For contracts awarded in 2006 and 2007, the contract term is 15 years. During the European Union bailout following the financial crisis of 2008, the Portuguese government sought to raise funds to reduce its electricity tariff deficit by offering wind generators the option to extend their initial regulatory life in return for upfront payment. The extension is for an additional 7 years with a cap-and-floor price following expiry of the feed-in-tariff. Incentives are also in place for repowering existing capacity at a lower rate.
In Uruguay, we benefit from a government promoted concession agreement and a long-term PPA with UTE - Administracion Nacional de Usinas y Transmisiones Electricas, the Republic of Uruguay’s state-owned electricity company. Under this PPA, we are required to deliver power at a fixed rate for the contract period, in all cases inflation adjusted.
Business Segments
We have three reportable segments: Solar, Wind, and Regulated Solar and Wind. These segments, which represent our entire portfolio of renewable energy facilities, have been determined based on the management approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the reportable segments. Our reportable segments represent an aggregation of operating segments. An operating segment is defined as a component of an enterprise that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, and that has discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision makers (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have been identified as the CODMs. 
Our operating segments consist of: (i) Distributed Generation, North America Solar Utility and International Solar Utility, which are aggregated into the Solar reportable segment; (ii) Northeast Wind, Central Wind, Texas Wind, Hawaii Wind, Portugal Wind and Uruguay Wind operating segments, which are aggregated into the Wind reportable segment; and (iii) the Spanish Regulated Solar and Spanish Regulated Wind operating segments that are aggregated within the Regulated Solar and Wind reportable segment. Portugal Wind, Uruguay Wind, and the Spanish Regulated Solar and Wind segments were added during the second quarter of 2018 upon the acquisition of Saeta and represent its entire operations (see Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures to our consolidated financial statements for additional details). The operating segments have been aggregated as they have similar economic characteristics and meet the aggregation criteria. The CODMs evaluate the performance of our operating segments principally based on operating income or loss. Corporate expenses include general and administrative expenses, acquisition costs, interest expense on corporate-level indebtedness, stock-based compensation and depreciation expense. All net operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were earned by our reportable segments from external customers in the United States (including Puerto Rico), Canada, Spain, Portugal, the United Kingdom, Uruguay and Chile.
Major Customers
For the year ended December 31, 2019, we earned an aggregate of $338.7 million from the Spanish Electricity System, including $240.7 million from the Comisión Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia (“CNMC”) for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing 25.6% of our net consolidated operating revenues. The CNMC is the state-owned regulator of the Spanish Electricity System who collects the funds payable, mainly from the tariffs to end user customers, and is responsible for the calculation and the settlement of regulated payments. Furthermore, we earned a total of $93.9 million from the Tennessee Valley Authority (“TVA”) for the years ended December 31, 2019, representing 10% of our net consolidated operating revenues. The TVA is a corporation wholly-owned by the U.S. government that sells power mainly to wholesale customers in several states in the Southern part on the U.S. We believe that the concentration risk with the CNMC is mitigated by, among other things, the indirect support of the Spanish government for the CNMC’s obligations and for the regulated rate system more generally. Similarly, we believe that the concentration risk of the credit risk with the TVA is mitigated by, among other things, the indirect support of the U.S. government. In California, where a portion of our solar generation fleet is located, 
we generated revenues from three public utilities located in the state. These three public utilities, in aggregate, accounted for approximately 10.9% of our net consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019.
See Item 1A. Business - Our Portfolio for additional details on the counterparties and customers to our offtake agreements.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we had 174 full-time employees, 83 of which were located in the United States and 69 in Spain. The agreements entered into between the TerraForm Power and Brookfield in connection with the Merger and Sponsorship Transaction provide for Brookfield to appoint our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel. These three executive officers are not employees of TerraForm Power and their services are provided pursuant to the Brookfield MSA. Subsequent to year end, as discussed in Note 26. Subsequent Events to our consolidated financial statements, on February 11, 2020, we acquired an approximately 100 MW CSP portfolio in Spain that included 64 employees also located in Spain.
Health, Safety, Security & Environment
We promote a culture of health, safety, security and environmental leadership. We strive to achieve excellence in safety performance and to be recognized as an industry leader in accident prevention. Our overall objective is to incur zero high risk safety incidents and zero lost time injuries. We have adopted a Health, Safety, Security and Environmental (“HSS&E”) policy that includes a framework for oversight, compliance, compliance audits and the sharing of best practices both within our operations and with other affiliates of Brookfield. We maintain an HSS&E Steering Committee and require all employees, contractors, agents and others involved in our operations to comply with our established HSS&E practices.
