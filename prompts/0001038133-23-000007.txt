Item 1. Business
Unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires, the terms "Heska," "we," "our," "us" and the "Company" refer to Heska Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Overview
We sell, manufacture, market and support diagnostic and specialty products and solutions for veterinary practitioners. Our portfolio includes point-of-care (“POC”) diagnostic laboratory instruments and consumables including rapid assay diagnostic products and digital cytology services; POC digital imaging diagnostic products; local and cloud-based data services; practice information management software (“PIMS”) and related software and support; reference laboratory testing; allergy testing and immunotherapy; heartworm preventive products; and vaccines. Our primary focus is on supporting companion animal veterinarians in providing care to their patients. 
Our business is composed of two operating and reportable segments: North America and International. North America consists of the United States, Canada and Mexico. International consists of geographies outside of North America, primarily our operations in Germany, Italy, Spain, France, Switzerland, Australia and Malaysia. The Company's strategic focus on POC diagnostic laboratory and imaging products is included in both segments. The North America segment also includes the contract manufacturing of vaccines and pharmaceutical products and a small veterinary laboratory, and the International segment includes our PIMS business and veterinary laboratories. 
For the year ended December 31, 2022, our North America and International segments represent approximately 60% and 40% of our total revenue, respectively. 
Acquisitions have been, and we expect that they will continue to be, meaningful to our organization’s growth and results of operations. In 2020, we completed the acquisition of scil animal care company GmbH ("scil"). Like Heska, scil focuses on POC diagnostic solutions for companion animal veterinarians, primarily in Europe. The scil acquisition represented a key milestone in the Company's history, creating an international veterinary diagnostics company with leadership positions in key geographic markets including Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Canada, and Malaysia.
We believe that companion animal veterinarians look to us and other diagnostic providers to provide a portfolio of solutions for their varied diagnostic needs. The scil acquisition significantly expanded the geographies that we serve and our customer base with regard to our core offerings: POC laboratory and imaging diagnostic solutions. In addition, we have deployed capital to invest in other elements of our diagnostic portfolio further described under products and services and as follows: 
•In 2021, we:
◦acquired BiEsse A-Laboratorio die Analisi Veterinarie S.r.l. (“BSA”), based in Milan, Italy, which expanded our reference laboratory capabilities;
◦acquired 65% of the equity of Biotech Laboratories U.S.A. LLC ("Biotech"), a developer of rapid assay diagnostic testing. In 2022, we incrementally increased our ownership to 75.50%; and
◦acquired Lacuna Diagnostics, Inc. ("Lacuna”) to expand our diagnostic offering to include digital cytology services.

Heartworm Preventive Products
We have an agreement with Merck Animal Health granting Merck Animal Health the non-exclusive distribution and marketing rights for our canine heartworm prevention product, Tri-Heart® Plus Chewable Tablets, ultimately sold to or through veterinarians in the U.S. Tri-Heart Plus Chewable Tablets (ivermectin/pyrantel) are indicated for use as a monthly preventive treatment of canine heartworm infection and for treatment and control of ascarid and hookworm infections. We manufacture Tri-Heart Plus Chewable Tablets at our Des Moines, Iowa production facility.
Allergy Products and Services
Allergies are common in companion animals. Clinical symptoms of allergies are variable, but often manifest as persistent and serious skin disease in dogs and cats. Management of allergic disease is clinically problematic, as there are a large number of allergens that may give rise to these conditions. ALLERCEPT® Definitive Allergen Panels are used to determine the specific allergens to which an animal, such as a dog, cat or horse, is reacting. The test results often serve as the basis for prescription ALLERCEPT® Therapy Shots and ALLERCEPT® Therapy Drops. Our veterinary laboratories in Loveland, Colorado and Fribourg, Switzerland both offer blood testing using our ALLERCEPT® Definitive Allergen Panels.

Other Vaccines and Pharmaceuticals ("OVP")
We manufacture biological and pharmaceutical products for a number of other animal health companies in our facility in Des Moines, Iowa. We manufacture products for livestock and companion animals. Our offerings range from providing a portfolio of services which include research, licensing, production, labeling and packaging of products to providing any one of these services as needed by our customers, as well as validation support and distribution services.
We developed a line of bovine vaccines that are regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture ("USDA"). In January 2015, we signed a long-term Master Supply Agreement related to these vaccines with Elanco Animal Health, Inc. ("Elanco"), which terminates on June 17, 2023. 
Marketing, Sales and Customer Support
The acceptance of our products and solutions by veterinarians is critical to our success. In both of our segments, we sell and market our core products and solutions to veterinarians through our internal marketing organization, our field sales organization, a telephone sales force and independent third-party distributors. In our North America segment, our OVP products are marketed and sold by third parties under third-party labels. We market and sell outside our key countries through third-party veterinary diagnostic laboratories and independent third-party distributors. As of December 31, 2022, our customer facing sales, installed base support and utilization organization consisted of 156 and 187 individuals in our North America and International segments, respectively.
Manufacturing
The majority of our revenue is derived from sales of products manufactured by third parties. Third parties manufacture our veterinary instruments, including affiliated consumables and supplies. Our acquisition of LightDeck represented an investment in our manufacturing capabilities. Following our acquisition of LightDeck, we own the manufacturing rights to the Element i+ analyzer and related consumables.
Our facility in Des Moines, Iowa is a USDA, Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and Drug Enforcement Agency ("DEA") licensed biological and pharmaceutical manufacturing facility. This facility currently has the capacity to manufacture more than 50 million doses of vaccine each year. We expect that we will, for the foreseeable future, manufacture most, or all of our pharmaceutical and biological products at this facility. We currently manufacture our canine heartworm prevention product, our allergy treatment products and our OVP products at this facility.
The OVP products for our North America segment are purchased in both finished and bulk format, and we perform all phases of manufacturing, including growth of the active bacterial and viral agents, sterile filling, lyophilization and packaging at this facility. We manufacture our various allergy products at our Des Moines facility, our Loveland facility and our Fribourg facility. We believe the raw materials for most of the products we manufacture are readily available from more than one source.
Product Development
We are committed to providing innovative products to address the health needs of companion animals. We may obtain such products from external sources, third-party collaboration arrangements or internal research and development.
We are committed to identifying external product opportunities and creating business and technical collaborations that lead to high value veterinary products and solutions. We believe that our active 
-6-


participation in scientific networks and our reputation for investing in research enhance our ability to develop and acquire new products and solutions. Our acquisition of LightDeck expanded our internal research and development capabilities. 
Intellectual Property
We rely upon various forms of intellectual property, including trade secrets, patents, trademarks, copyrights, know-how, continuing technological innovations, and licenses and other proprietary rights to develop and maintain our competitive position. Our various agreements with third party manufacturers for POC products provide obligations to protect our intellectual property, as well as intellectual property associated with our products. The proprietary technologies of our OVP products are primarily protected through trade secret protection of, for example, our manufacturing processes in this area.
We actively seek patent protection both in the U.S. and abroad. Our issued patent portfolios primarily relate to allergy and diagnostic technologies. As of December 31, 2022, we owned, co-owned or had rights to one issued U.S. patent expiring in April 2024 and had one pending U.S. patent application. Our corresponding foreign patent portfolio as of December 31, 2022 included one issued patent in Canada expiring in August 2024.
We also have obtained exclusive and non-exclusive licenses for numerous other patents held by academic institutions and for-profit companies. Our material licenses include our exclusive license to develop and commercialize the Nu.Q® POC cancer screening and monitoring solution for dogs and cats.
Seasonality
We do not experience significant seasonal fluctuations in our sales throughout the year.
Government Regulation
Although the majority of our revenue is from the sale of unregulated items, many of our products or products that we may develop are, or may be, subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S., including the USDA, FDA and the EPA and by similar agencies in other countries. These regulations govern, among other things, the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, pre-market approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of our products. Satisfaction of these requirements can take several years to achieve, and the time needed to satisfy them may vary substantially, based on the type, complexity, and novelty of the product. Any product that we develop must receive all relevant regulatory approval or clearances, if required, before it may be marketed in a particular country. The following summarizes the major U.S. government agencies that regulate animal health products:
•USDA. Vaccines and certain single use, POC diagnostics are considered veterinary biologics and are therefore regulated by the Center for Veterinary Biologics, or CVB, of the USDA. The USDA licensing process involves the submission of several data packages. These packages include information on how the product will be manufactured, information on the efficacy and safety of the product in laboratory and target animal studies and information on performance of the product in field conditions.
-7-


•FDA. Pharmaceutical products, which typically include synthetic compounds, are approved and monitored by the Center for Veterinary Medicine of the FDA. Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the same statutory standard for FDA approval applies to both human and animal drugs: demonstrated safety, efficacy and compliance with FDA manufacturing standards. However, unlike human drugs, neither preclinical studies nor a sequential phase system of studies are required. Rather, for animal drugs, studies for safety and efficacy may be conducted immediately in the species for which the drug is intended. Thus, there is no required phased evaluation of drug performance, and the Center for Veterinary Medicine will review data at appropriate times in the drug development process. 
•EPA. Products that are applied topically to animals or to premises to control external parasites are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA.
After we have received regulatory licensing or approval for our products, numerous regulatory requirements typically apply. Among the conditions for certain regulatory approvals is the requirement that our manufacturing facilities or those of our third-party manufacturers may need to conform to current Good Manufacturing Practices or other manufacturing regulations, which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as maintenance of records and documentation. The USDA, FDA, EPA and foreign regulatory authorities strictly enforce manufacturing regulatory requirements through periodic inspections and/or reports.
A number of our animal health products are not regulated. For example, certain products such as our ALLERCEPT® panels are not regulated by either the USDA or FDA. Similarly, none of our veterinary instruments requires regulatory approval to be marketed and sold in the U.S.
We have pursued Conformité Européene (CE) Marking for certain POC laboratory instruments and imaging equipment and regulatory approval outside the U.S. based on market demographics of foreign countries. For marketing outside the U.S., we are subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing regulatory licensing and approval for many of our products. Licensing and approval by comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained before we can market products in those countries. Product licensing approval processes and requirements vary from country to country and the time required for such approvals may differ substantially from that required in the U.S. We cannot be certain that approval of any of our products in one country will result in approvals in any other country.
To date, we or our distributors have sought regulatory approval for certain of our products from the Canadian Center for Veterinary Biologics, or CCVB (Canada); the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, or MAFF (Japan); the Australian Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, or ADAFF (Australia); the Republic of South Africa Department of Agriculture, or RSADA (South Africa); the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, or ADCD (Hong Kong); the Macau Animal Health Division of Animal Control and Inspection, or IACM (Macau); the Spanish Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food; and from the relevant regulatory authorities in certain other countries requiring such approval.

Competition
Our market is intensely competitive. Our competitors include animal health companies and major pharmaceutical companies that have animal health divisions as well as human health companies. We also compete with independent, third-party distributors and suppliers, including distributors and suppliers who sell products under their own private labels. In the POC diagnostic testing market, our major competitors include IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. ("IDEXX") and Zoetis Inc. ("Zoetis"). Each of IDEXX and Zoetis has a larger veterinary product and service offering than we do and a large sales infrastructure network and a well-established brand name. The primary business of IDEXX, like ours, is veterinary diagnostics while the primary business of Zoetis is veterinary pharmaceuticals. 
In our North America segment, the OVP products we manufacture for sale by third parties compete with similar products offered by a number of other companies, some of which have substantially greater financial, technical, research and other resources than us and may have more established marketing, sales, distribution and service organizations than we do. Companies with a significant presence in the animal health market include C.H. Boehringer Sohn AG & Co. KG (Boehringer Ingelheim), CEVA Santé Animale, Elanco, Merck Animal Health, Sanofi, Vétoquinol S.A., and Virbac S.A. These and other competitors and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial, technical, research and other resources and larger, more established marketing, sales, distribution and service organizations than we do. Our competitors may offer broader product lines and have greater name recognition than we do.
Environmental Regulation
In connection with our product development activities and manufacturing of our biological, pharmaceutical, diagnostic and detection products, we are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of certain materials, biological specimens and wastes. Although we believe that we have complied with these laws, regulations and policies in all material respects and have not been required to take any significant action to correct any noncompliance, we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in the future. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources.

Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 808 persons, 428 in North America and 380 internationally. We employ temporary workers on a need only basis to maintain business flexibility and a dynamic workforce. We are committed to employee diversity and inclusion and the support of traditionally underrepresented groups in management. Our workforce is approximately 53% women and 47% men with 44% of our U.S. management team (defined as Director, Vice President, Senior Vice President and Executive Vice President) represented by women. 
We believe that the current and future ability to execute on our strategic initiatives is highly dependent upon our ability to recruit, retain and reward our employees. We engage in targeted recruitment strategies to fill highly skilled positions. Our employees enjoy competitive compensation plans including market rate targeted salaries, robust benefits including retirement plans and employee stock purchase plan opportunities, and the opportunity for participation in short- and long-term incentive programs. Our compensation philosophy is designed to provide an appealing, market-based and rewarding compensation program that encourages high personal and company performance, strong cultural and ethical behavior, and incentives aligned with stockholder interests. Our aim is to attract, engage and retain highly qualified, motivated, and creative people who will fulfill our mission to be the “voice of the pet,” while delivering on Heska goals in a healthy, honest, and sustainable manner.
We are committed to providing a workplace that protects the health and well-being of our employees. All employees are required to abide by our Code of Conduct and Ethics, company health and safety parameters and contribute to a positive and friendly company culture. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and in consideration of our employees’ safety, in March 2020, we implemented work from home policies for employees with the ability to work remotely, along with targeted on-site attendance for employees whose job requires their physical presence. At our Des Moines, Iowa manufacturing facility, we instituted staggered start times, designated building entry/exit protocols and closed common areas to maximize “social distancing” guidelines. We anticipate easing restrictions implemented during the height of the pandemic and continuing limited return to work procedures throughout 2023. Internationally, we continue to abide by local and country specific governmental requirements and follow local authority recommendations.
