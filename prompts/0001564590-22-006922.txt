--------+---------

General Development and Narrative Description of Business 
 Retail Value Inc. is an Ohio corporation (the “Company” or “RVI”) formed in December 2017 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of SITE Centers Corp. (“SITE Centers”).  On July 1, 2018, the date of the Company’s spin-off from SITE Centers into a separate publicly traded company, the Company owned 48 properties and had two reportable segments: continental U.S. and Puerto Rico.  As a result of the sale of the Company’s remaining Puerto Rico properties in August 2021, the Company no longer reports financial results for the Puerto Rico segment and instead reports the financial results of the Puerto Rico segment as discontinued operations for all periods presented.  At December 31, 2021, RVI owned one retail shopping center in Gulfport, Mississippi comprising 0.6 million square feet of Company-owned gross leasable area (“GLA”) which was 91.2% occupied. The Company refers to this property, Crossroads Center, as its “remaining property,” its “remaining real estate investment” or its “remaining real estate asset.”  The Company’s interest in this property is subject to a ground lease which has an expiration date in November 2033 and one, 25-year renewal option.
 The Company remains focused on realizing value through the sale of its remaining property and the collection of its accounts receivable, the proceeds of which are expected to be used to fund a reserve account from which the Company will pay expenses and claims in connection with the winding up of its operations and make distributions to the Company’s common shareholders.  The Company is a Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”) that is externally managed and advised by one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries of SITE Centers (collectively with such wholly-owned subsidiaries, the “Manager”).  Prior to January 1, 2022, the Company, its subsidiaries and the Manager were parties to property management agreements pursuant to which the Manager provided property management and leasing services (the “Property Management Agreements”) and a corporate management agreement (the “External Management Agreement”) pursuant to which the Manager provided corporate management services to the Company.  The Company, its subsidiaries and the Manager have entered into a new External Management Agreement, effective January 1, 2022 (the “New Management Agreement”), which provides for property management, leasing services and disposition efforts for the Company’s remaining property and for corporate services in connection with the anticipated wind-up of the Company’s business.
 Recent Developments
 See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, for information on certain recent developments of the Company, which is incorporated herein by reference to such information.  
COVID-19 Pandemic 
 In March 2020, the World Health Organization categorized COVID-19 as a pandemic, and it continues to spread throughout the United States and other countries across the world.  Beginning in mid-March 2020, federal, state and local governments took various actions to limit the spread of COVID-19, including ordering the temporary closure of non-essential businesses (which included many of the Company’s tenants) and imposing significant social distancing guidelines and restrictions on the continued operations of essential businesses and the reopening of non-essential businesses.  The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the Company’s collection of rents and the pace of its disposition activity from April 2020 through December 2020. During the second half of 2020 and early 2021, the Manager worked with tenants to maximize the collection of unpaid 2020 rents by offering rent deferment on a case-by-case basis often in exchange for concessions, including tenant extensions of lease terms.
 The level of tenant rent collections and the pace of disposition activity improved significantly in 2021 and the Company was able to complete the sale of 21 properties in 2021, including the entirety of its Puerto Rico portfolio, for an aggregate sales price of $933.6 million. The Company continues to focus on collecting its accounts receivable, selling its remaining property, making distributions of available cash to shareholders and winding up its operations, though these efforts remain subject to general economic conditions and other developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  As of February 18, 2022, disruptions caused by the Omicron variant had not had an adverse impact on the Company’s remaining operations, though the Company recognizes that plans to sell its remaining property, collect accounts receivable and wind up its business could be negatively impacted by additional surges in COVID-19 contagion, the emergence of new COVID-19 variants which are more infectious or resistant to existing vaccines, decreases in the effectiveness of such vaccines and any implementation of additional restrictions on tenant businesses as a result thereof. For a further discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and “Disposition Outlook” included in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.

Competition 
 Numerous real estate companies and developers, private and public, compete with the Company for leasing space in shopping centers to tenants. The Company competes with other real estate companies and developers in terms of rental rate, property location, availability of other space and maintenance. 
Insurance 
 The Company has comprehensive liability, casualty, flood, terrorism and rental loss insurance policies on its remaining property. The Company believes the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate and adequate for the property given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice; however, the Company’s insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover its losses. For additional information, see “Risks Related to the Company’s Business Operations and Its Remaining Property—The Location of the Company’s Remaining Property Makes It Vulnerable to Natural Disasters, Extreme Weather Conditions and Climate Change.  An Uninsured Loss or a Loss That Exceeds the Limits of the Company’s Insurance Policies Could Subject the Company to a Loss of Capital and Revenue” included in Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Governmental Regulations 
 The Company’s business is subject to numerous governmental regulations, including regulations relating to the ownership of real estate, environmental law, regulations governing REITs and others. For additional information, see “Risks Related to the Company’s Business Operations and Its Remaining Property—The Company’s Current or Former Real Estate Investments May Entail Environmental Risks That Could Adversely Affect Its Results of Operations and Disposition Prospects” and “Risks Related to the Company’s Taxation as a REIT—If the Company Does Not Qualify as a REIT in Any Taxable Year, It Will Be Subject to U.S. Federal Income Tax as a Regular Corporation and Could Have Significant Tax Liability, Which May Have a Significant Adverse Consequence to the Value of the Company’s Common Shares” included in Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Compliance with Environmental Laws 
 As an owner of real estate, the Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations. See the detailed discussion of these and other risks related to environmental matters in “Risks Related to the Company’s Business Operations and its Remaining Property—The Company’s Current or Former Real Estate Investments May Entail Environmental Risks That Could Adversely Affect Its Results of Operations and Disposition Prospects” included in Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Qualification as a Real Estate Investment Trust
 As of December 31, 2021, the Company met the qualification requirements of a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).  As a result, the Company will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent it meets certain requirements of the Code.  The Company may elect to surrender its REIT status for future taxable years in connection with the anticipated wind-up of its business in the event the Company determines that the anticipated benefits to the Company and its shareholders of maintaining REIT qualification do not exceed the related compliance costs or if the nature of the Company’s remaining operations makes compliance with REIT requirements impracticable.  
Employees 
 The Company is managed by the Manager pursuant to the New Management Agreement. All of the Company’s executive officers are employees of the Manager or its affiliates. The Company does not have any employees.

 The Company’s Manager
 The Company is externally managed and advised by the Manager pursuant to the New Management Agreement. The Company does not have any employees. Instead, pursuant to the terms of the New Management Agreement, the Manager provides the Company with its management team, including a chief executive officer, along with appropriate support personnel, in order to provide the 
 6


management services to be provided by the Manager to the Company.  Accordingly, each of the Company’s executive officers is an executive of SITE Centers. 
 SITE Centers, however, is not obligated to dedicate any of its executives or other personnel exclusively to the Company. In addition, neither SITE Centers nor its executives or other personnel, including its executive officers supplied to the Company, are obligated to dedicate any specific portion of its or their time to the Company. The New Management Agreement requires only that members of the Company’s management team devote such time as is necessary and appropriate, commensurate with the level of the Company’s activity. Nevertheless, the Company believes it benefits from the personnel, relationships and experience of SITE Centers’ executive team. 
 The Manager is at all times subject to the supervision and oversight of the Board of Directors and has only such functions, responsibilities and authority as are specified in the New Management Agreement.
