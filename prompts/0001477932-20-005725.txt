Our Business Strategy
 
We aim to become a leading global IPP in green energy, by owning and operating a global network of distributed and connected green energy power plants, in countries where the combination of economic, environmental and political policies is optimized and supportive for the long-term, ever-growing need for clean renewable energy. Diversity across multiple parks in multiple jurisdictions provides highly diversified income streams backed by long term, government FiTs and PPAs.
 
To achieve this goal, we intend to pursue the following strategies:
 

• | Continue our proven growth strategy targeted on acquiring independent solar PV projects either newly constructed or already operational in secondary markets in order to build a diversified portfolio across multiple geographies. Our niche focus on small to midsize solar PV parks and working with local developers allows us to acquire parks at prices of up to 25% below market;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | Our focus on individual or small groups of PV solar parks precludes access by investment funds as the sellers have a very limited market; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
○ | Exclusive Developer Agreements: contracts with these partners results in little competition in acquisition pricing, leading to below market acquisition prices; these Developer Agreements provide us with the exclusive right to acquire a pipeline of projects from a third-party developer in a specific country (ie. Germany), the consideration for which is a fixed margin to be paid to the partner. We recently entered into two additional similar contracts, again providing us with the right to acquire projects from developers, exclusively, at a discount. These agreements result in decreased construction / acquisition costs due to volume discounts from our developer partner as they benefit from economies of scale, which leads to below market acquisition prices. We also expect to enter into similar agreements in the future, as we will look to grow the Company by providing the financing required for development and construction of assets. 
○ | We work directly with specialist development partners in each country; 


• | Expand our global IPP portfolio in regions with attractive returns on investment and increase our stable recurring revenue and cash flow;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Optimize our financing sources to support long-term growth and profitability in a cost-efficient manner; and 



We do not operate our business on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but rather, with long-term shareholder value creation as a priority. We aim to maximize return for our shareholders by acquiring positive cash flow assets with long-term income streams at the lowest possible risk and we will continue to operate with this priority as we continue to invest in our infrastructure and additional solar PV parks to increase our installed power and long term revenue streams.
 
Our goal is to grow our asset base and within our operations provide sufficient liquidity for recurring growth capital expenditures and general purposes.
 
Our Portfolio
 
Our current portfolio consists of solar PV parks located in Romania, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands with a total owned capacity of 40.8MW as of December 31, 2019. The German and Italian projects enjoy 20-year government counter-party FiT contracts at fixed sales prices that provide long-term predictable positive cash flows at average 85% gross margins. The Romanian parks operate under a “green certificate” government incentive scheme over a minimum of 15 years whereby the projects earn a certain number of GCs for the energy produced that are then subsequently sold to the Romanian energy market. The Netherlands project has a fifteen year contracted revenue stream as part of a government program. 
 
The following table lists the solar PV parks that comprise our portfolio as of December 31, 2019:
 

Country | MWs Owned, (Installed and Operational) | MWs Owned (Not Yet Operational) | Total Owned
------------+----------------------------------------+----------------------------------+------------
Romania | 6.1 MW | — | 6.1MW 
Italy | 7.9 MW | -- | 7.9MW 
Germany | 1.4 MW | 13.6MW | 15.0MW 
Netherlands | 11.8 MW | -- | 11.8MW 
Total | 27.2 MW | 13.6MW | 40.8MW

----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe the following competitive strengths have contributed and will continue to contribute to our success:
 

• | We are an IPP with comfort in operating across all aspects of the solar PV value chain from development through to ownership – as opposed to just buying operating parks where the high levels of competition from investment funds tends to be. In this way we have opportunities to acquire projects earlier in the process and so lock out investment fund competitors; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | We provide a minimum committed offtake for local developers which makes us a more attractive partner as they have a single trusted customer that allows developers to plan effectively and grow faster. As a result, we have been able to sign developer contracts that provide us with a right of first refusal for all projects developed by our partners and therefore lock out other market operators for these projects (“Developer Agreements”); 
• | Given the above, we also benefit from Developer Agreements through decreased construction / acquisition costs due to volume discounts from our developer partner as they benefit from economies of scale. With this approach we have a proven ability to acquire parks at prices of up to 25% below the prices that investment funds will pay for the same assets. This also provides an immediate equity cushion in the projects we acquire as we will always have the ability to sell the projects at higher costs than we acquired them;
• | Our proven track record of identifying and entering solar PV markets, on-the-ground capabilities and global platform give us key competitive advantages in developing and operating solar parks globally; 
• | Our existing pipeline of secured solar PV parks provides us with clear and actionable opportunities to grow power generation and earnings as these are required; 
• | Our comprehensive project development capabilities, in collaboration with local teams on the ground, allow us to consistently deliver high quality solar parks at competitive costs; 
• | We are technology and supplier agnostic and as such we have the flexibility to choose from a broad range of leading manufacturers, O&M experts, top tier suppliers and EPC vendors globally and continue to benefit from falling component and service costs; 
• | As a public company, management believes it will have access to a variety of flexible financing sources which are not available to other market participants which allows us to structure transactions more flexibly than our competitors, even though some competitors may have a lower cost of capital than we can currently achieve; 
• | We are led by a highly experienced management team supported by strong, localized execution capabilities across all key functions and locations.

Our Competition
 
Power generation is a capital-intensive business with numerous industry participants. We compete to acquire solar PV parks and project rights with other renewable energy developers, IPPs and financial investors based on cost of capital, development expertise, pipeline, price, operations and management expertise, global footprint, brand reputation and the ability to monetize green attributes (such as green certificates (“GCs”) and tax incentives) of renewable power.
 
We face specific competition in two distinct areas, projects under development and operational projects from competitors. Each segment has different competitors due to the nature of market participants as outlined below;
 

Competitor | Competitor Weakness | Competitor Strength | How We Compete 
--------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------
Pension/ Specialist Investment Funds | • | Tend to focus exclusively on acquiring operational parks (even if just completed) | • | Lower cost of equity capital | We compete by entering the construction process earlier with niche partners, thereby locking them out of projects we acquire from small developer partners who cannot access these competitors due to their size.
• | Will not take any construction or development risk | • | Large funds available to deploy
 | • | Only acquire large scale projects due to minimum transaction size requirement | • | Will also commission projects to be constructed for them – but large ones 
Other IPP’s | • | May not take any construction or development risk | • | Larger players will have lower cost of equity capital | We provide guaranteed minimum offtake of developed projects under exclusive right of first refusal contracts that locks out the competitors. 
 | • | Smaller IPP’s will have similar cost of capital as ALTN | • | Will commission projects to be constructed for them and will also work with portfolios of smaller parks | Our established agent and trusted partner network sources projects before market, and we have first mover advantage. 
 | • | Potential geographic focus so not present in all markets | • | Operational history and track record | As we continue to grow, we mitigate any operational history advantages of the competitors. 



Notwithstanding the above, it is management’s belief that the solar PV market is in high growth globally with many participants constantly arriving. There is also an increasing demand for projects from both government and corporates. In this environment although there are many players and participants, there is currently room for many participants and there does not appear to be significant industry consolidation and it remains a very fragmented market. 
 
With our proven niche focus on partner and project acquisition we feel we currently compete effectively in the markets we address. In addition, we believe that given our current growth strategy and as a public reporting company we will have opportunities to consolidate certain market participants and segments in certain geographies over time that may not be available to other participants. If successful, this would further enhance our market position and sustained competitiveness in the medium to long term.
 
Nevertheless, we expect to face increased competition in all aspects of our business, target markets and industry segments, financing options, and partner availability as markets mature as countries reach their targeted renewable energy generation.

Our Challenges
 
Our ability to successfully execute our strategies is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.
 
See “Risk Factors” and “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties associated with our business.
 
Seasonality and Resource Availability
 
The amount of electricity produced, and revenues generated by, our solar generation facilities is dependent in part on the amount of sunlight, or irradiation, where the assets are located. As shorter daylight hours in winter months result in less irradiation, the electricity generated by these facilities will vary depending on the season. Irradiation can also be variable at a particular location from period to period due to weather or other meteorological patterns, which can affect operating results. As the majority of our solar power plants are located in the Northern Hemisphere (Europe) we expect our current solar portfolio’s power generation to be at its lowest during the first and fourth quarters of each year. Therefore, we expect our first and fourth quarter solar revenue to be lower than in other quarters. As a result, on average, each solar park generates approximately 15% of its annual revenues in Q1 every year, 35% in each of Q2 and Q3, and the remaining 15% in Q4. Our costs are relatively flat over a year, and so we will always report lower profits in Q1 and Q4 as compared to the middle of the year. 
Environmental and Government Regulation
 
Environmental Matters 
 
We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we own and operate renewable energy facilities. These laws and regulations generally require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained and maintained both before construction and during operation of these renewable energy facilities. We incur costs in the ordinary course of business to comply with these laws, regulations and permit requirements. We do not anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental compliance for our renewable energy facilities in the next several years. While we do not expect that the costs of compliance would generally have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations, it is possible that as the size of our portfolio grows we may become subject to new or modified regulatory regimes that may impose unanticipated requirements on our business as a whole that were not anticipated with respect to any individual renewable energy facility. Additionally, environmental laws and regulations frequently change and often become more stringent, or subject to more stringent interpretation or enforcement, and therefore future changes could require us to incur materially higher costs which could have a material negative impact on our financial performance or results of operations.
Regulatory Matters, Government Legislation and Incentives 
 
In Romania, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands, the Company is generally subject to the regulations of the relevant energy regulatory agencies applicable to all producers of electricity under the relevant feed-in tariff or other governmental incentive programs (collectively “FiT”) (including the FiT rates); however, it is not subject to regulation as a traditional public utility (i.e., regulation of our financial organization and rates other than FiT rates).
 
As the size of our portfolio grows, or as applicable rules and regulations evolve, we may become subject to new or modified regulatory regimes that may impose unanticipated requirements on our business as a whole that were not anticipated with respect to any individual renewable energy facility. Any local, state, federal or international regulations could place significant restrictions on our ability to operate our business and execute our business plan by prohibiting or otherwise restricting the sale of electricity by us. If we were deemed to be subject to the same state, federal or foreign regulatory authorities as traditional utility companies, or if new regulatory bodies were established to oversee the renewable energy industry in Europe or in international markets, our operating costs could materially increase, adversely affecting our results of operations.
 
Each of the countries in which we operate has established various incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of renewable energy and to accelerate the adoption of PV solar and other renewable energies. These incentives include tax credits, cash grants, favorable tax treatment and depreciation, rebates, GCs, net energy metering programs, FiTs and other incentives. These incentives help catalyze private sector investments in renewable energy and efficiency measures. Changes in the government incentives in each of these jurisdictions could have a material impact on our financial performance.
 

11

Europe
 In December 2018, the new revised Renewables Energy Directive (2018/2001) entered into force, establishing a new binding renewable energy target for the EU for 2030 of at least 32%, with a clause for a possible upwards revision by 2023. To put that into perspective, energy from renewable sources made up approximately 17.5% at the end of 2017. This revised directive puts a further impetus on EU member states to ensure they deliver on their individual renewable energy targets. Each country has their own framework in place to promote renewable energy. These mechanisms vary from country to country. We have briefly summarized the historical and current position for solar PV for each country we currently operate in below. 
Romania 
 Romanian regulation on support for energy produced from renewable sources is set out in the Law 220/2008. This law, under modifications 139/2010 and 184/2018 sets out a national target of 24% of gross energy produced to come from renewable energy sources by the year 2020. It also sets out national targets regarding the percentage of electricity produced from renewable sources of energy in the final gross consumption of electricity for years 2010, 2015 and 2020 which is 33%, 35% and 38%, respectively. Under the law, the National Energy Regulatory Authority (ANRE) is the body which qualifies the renewable energy installations that benefit from the support scheme, in the terms of the Regulations for qualifying producers of electricity from renewable sources, so as to apply the green certificate promotion system and it elaborates the regulatory guidelines for the monitoring of production costs/revenues of producers from renewable sources which benefit from the promotion scheme by means of GCs.
 
All renewable energy installations connected up to December 31, 2016 are entitled to receive GCs for a period of 15 years after the ANRE grant the accreditation for the renewable energy installation. All GCs are valid up to December 31, 2030 and can be traded until this date even if a period of 15 years has already been reached. The value of each GC as set out in Law 220/2008 in euro denomination is a minimum of 27 euros to a maximum of 55 euros. Each year these values are indexed by ANRE according to the average inflation parameter in the month of December of the previous year per Eurostat communications and the value in LEI is calculated at a medium exchange rate set by the National Bank of Romania. Currently the minimum rate is set at 136.82 LEI. Operators can also receive additional income for the energy produced by their renewable energy installation as described below. 
 
The solar PV parks that were connected up to December 31, 2013 received six GCs for each MWh delivered to the grid. From these six GCs, only four GCs per MWh can currently be traded while the other two are postponed for trading until December 31, 2020. The postponed GCs are to be reinstated starting from January 2021 in equal tranches until December 2030. Solar parks that were connected from January 1, 2014 up to December 31, 2016 received only three GCs per MWh. When the legislation was introduced the government had set a quota for solar PV to be installed. They set a timeline of six years for the GCs scheme, however the quota for solar PV was actually achieved in two years instead of six as it was not controlled by the government on a time or operator basis. The budget therefore ran out before the end of the programme (December 31, 2016) which gave rise to the changes as described above.
 
An operator can sell the energy and GCs produced in several ways:
 

1. | Sell energy though OPCOM, the exchange market for energy (SPOT market), based on daily forecasting. Regarding GC sales, there are two sessions every month where all producers upload a maximum of 10,000 GCs they have for sale. The market is anonymous and there is no visibility between the seller and the buyer. Additionally, there is another anonymous market where you can stay for one month and buyers are not obliged to buy only during the two sessions organized per month;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Sign a PPA and sell the GCs to a trader or grid operator. This can only be carried out for plants up to 3 MW in size per licensed producer. The price the buyer pays for GCs cannot be lower than €29/GC; or 
3. | Have contracts in place directly with a buyer for the GC and also sell energy on the SPOT market through OPCOM provided the park is up to 3 MW in size. 


12



Currently there is no support scheme in place for commercial scale renewables in Romania as the country met its 2020 targets for renewable energy early in 2017. Under Law 184/2018 there is a prosumer support scheme for solar of up to 27kW. 
 
Italy
 The Gestore dei Servizi Energetici - GSE S.p.A. plays a central role in the promotion, support and development of renewable energy sources in Italy. GSE’s sole shareholder is the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance which, in consultation with the Ministry of Economic Development, provides guidance on GSE’s activities. GSE promotes sustainable development by granting economic support for electricity generation from renewable energy sources and by organizing communication campaigns to raise awareness of environmentally-sustainable energy use.
 
Italian regulation on support for energy produced from solar PV was set out in the “Conto Energia” under legislative decree 387 in 2003. From 2003 to 2012, there were four more iterations of this law which stipulated the conditions under which solar PV could be supported via a FiT subsidy. Under the original regulation a FiT was guaranteed for 20 years, which was a flat nominal fee depending on a number of variables. However the targets set out in the legislation were met earlier than expected and had to be revised as described below under law decree No. 91. In addition to the FiT, operators can also receive income for the energy produced by their park from energy sold on the spot market or via a PPA. “Conto Energia” was finalized in July 2013 for new installations. Italy was one of a handful of countries in the EU to meet its 2020 targets for renewable energy use early in 2017. 
 
Original FiT Support
 

• | Attractive incentive: flat nominal FiT for 20 years PLUS sale of electricity at the pool price; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Provision of priority access to power grid for renewable energy projects and guaranteed off-take of power;
• | Scheme funded by the end consumers through a surcharge to the electricity bill. 



The law decree No. 91 (converted into ordinary law August 11, 2014) introduced, inter alia, measures aimed at reducing end-users’ electricity bills in the short to medium term by spreading incentives over a longer period due to rapid build-up of renewable capacity. Three options (A,B,C) to the FiT were provided as follows:
 

A. | Reduction of 19% with four-year extension (over the original 20 years); 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B. | Reduction for the first five years of 14.5% followed by six years of progressive increase of 4.1% followed by five years of FiT 14.5% higher than the original FiT (the increase equal to the opposite of the decrease of the first five years);
C. | Reduction of 8% over the remainder of the FiT period. 



A new incentive decree known as Fer Decree 2019 was introduced in Italy in July 2019. The Decree sets out procedures and requirements for accessing financial supports for renewable energy sources. Solar PV will be supported under this decree in a number of ways through the mechanism of registers and auctions for access to incentives through a tendering process managed by the GSE. It also sets out regulation for PPA’s.
 
Germany
 The responsibility for the energy transition and all aspects related to it, including climate change, in Germany is concentrated at the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi). The main national regulatory authority is the Federal Network Agency for Electricity, Gas, Telecommunications, Post and Railway (Bundesnetzagentur - BNetzA) under the authority of the BMWi. 
 
German regulation on support for energy produced from renewable sources is set out in the Renewable Energy Sources Act 2017 (EEG 2017) set out by the BMWi. The EEG 2017 provides a stable regulatory framework and the basis for a new growth phase in Germany. It sets out the structure for competition-based funding for renewable energy in Germany. It stipulates an annual target of 1.9GW of solar PV to be added to the grid under the new legislation introduced in December 2018 (Energiesammelgesetz). It sets out an overall target of 52GW for solar PV installations which are guaranteed a FiT, at which point the FiT support is capped.

Auction Process under EEG 2017
 
• | The auction process provides up to 600MW of solar power advertised each year for auction. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Under the new legislation (Energiesammelgesetz) introduced in December 2018, in 2019 there will be two tender rounds of 500MW each for PV systems exceeding 750kW. In 2020, the law foresees four additional tenders with a cumulative capacity of 1.4GW; and in 2021, another four dates are scheduled with an aggregate capacity of 1.6GW. 
• | All capacity constructed under these specific tenders will not be added to Germany’s 52GW cap of PV installations. Once this cap is reached, the federal government plans to discontinue FiT subsidies for the solar industry. Unless extended, the cap will likely be achieved by3Q of 2020. This will potentially impact our solar projects if they have not achieved commercial operation by that date.



FiT Support and Eligibility
 
• | Installations of less than 750kW are exempted from the auction scheme and are supported by a FiT scheme under EEG 2017. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | This includes all new small and medium-sized commercial and industrial rooftop or ground mounted PV systems. 
• | The FiT contract spans 20 years and once a contract is set, that FiT is received for the duration of the contract subject to Section 49 EEG 2017, as explained below. 
• | Additional energy sales revenue is not applicable under the FiT Contract. 
• | Payments are made on a monthly basis by the grid system operator and direct marketing company as supported under EEG 2017 for all electricity fed into the grid by the installation.

Netherlands
 The Stimulation of Sustainable Energy Production, otherwise known as the SDE+ is the scheme that supports renewable energy production in the Netherlands. It is managed by the Netherlands Enterprise Agency Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland (RVO) and supported by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy. It provides an operating grant subsidy for renewable energy production through a tender based system. The duration of the subsidy once granted, under SDE+ is up to a maximum of 15 years. The overall target of the SDE+ is to have 16% renewable energy production by 2023. To put this into perspective the total share of renewables was 7.4% by the end of 2018 in the Netherlands up from 6.6% the previous year. The Netherlands added approximately 2.5GW of solar PV in 2019. The largest market segment was rooftop solar with approximately 40% in the commercial & industrial segment and an equal share in the residential segment with utility scale segment including ground mounted and floating solar responsible for approximately 20% of the market.
 
The subsidies work by compensating the difference between the wholesale price of electricity from fossil fuel sources and the price of electricity from renewable sources via a Feed-in-Tariff. The amount received depends on energy price trends. If the energy price goes up, an SDE+ contribution applies, but the energy purchaser will pay more. If, on the other hand, the energy price falls, a higher SDE+ contribution applies, but less will be received from the energy purchaser.
 

· | The SDE+ Scheme uses a tender system in which different renewable technologies compete with each other for a subsidy award. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The RVO pay the granted SDE+ subsidy (Feed-in-Tariff) every month based on an actual production and this amount is adjusted at the end of each calendar year based on total production output and energy market rates. 
· | Currently the subsidy is made available in 2 stages throughout the year usually in Spring and Autumn. 
· | In 2019 under the SDE+ subsidies were made available under 2 main categories of Solar PV - 1. A capacity of ≥ 15kWp and < 1MWp and a capacity of ≥ 1MWp (with a large scale connection to the grid) 
· | For parks of 500KWp+ or smaller installations when combined add up to 500KWp, a feasibility study must be provided through the application process, and if the solar installation is to be built in a field or to a facade or on water (floating system) an environmental permit must be acquired prior to applying. 
· | Park operation must start at the latest within 1.5 years for installations < 1MWp and up to 3 years for building related installations ≥ 1MWp and up to 4 years for non-building related systems after the SDE+ has been granted 
· | The SDE+ scheme allows for the possibility of banking meaning that in case of less energy production than the estimated annual production, the difference can be used in later years (underproduction). Producers can also carry over any excess output to a following year (overproduction). This can be used if production is lower than estimated in a later year.
· | The scheme is financed through a levy on the use of electricity and gas.
