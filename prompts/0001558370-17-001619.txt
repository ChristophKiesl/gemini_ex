 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 Overview
 We are a provider of professional technical and consulting services to utilities, private industry, and public agencies at all levels of government. We enable our clients to realize cost and energy savings by providing a wide range of specialized services. We assist our clients with a broad range of complementary services relating to:
· | Energy Efficiency and Sustainability;
--+--------------------------------------

--+---------------------------------------


· | National Preparedness and Interoperability.
--+--------------------------------------------

  We operate our business through a nationwide network of offices in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Kansas, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington and Washington, DC. As of December 30, 2016, we had 831 employees which includes licensed engineers and other professionals. 
 We seek to establish close working relationships with our clients and expand the breadth and depth of the services we provide to them over time.  Our business with public and private utilities is concentrated primarily in California and New York, but we also have business with utilities in Illinois, New Jersey, Ohio, Texas, Utah and Washington State.  We currently serve 19 major utility customers across the country.  Our business with public agencies is concentrated in Arizona, California and New York. We provide services to many of the cities and counties in California. We also serve special districts, school districts, a range of public agencies and private industry. 
 We were founded in 1964 and Willdan Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed in 2006 to serve as our holding company. Historically, our clients have been public agencies in communities with populations ranging from 10,000 to 300,000 people.  We believe communities of this size are underserved by large outsourcing companies that tend to focus on securing large federal and state projects and private sector projects.  Since expanding into energy efficiency services, our client base has grown to include investor-owned and other public utilities as well as substantial energy users in government and business.
 We consist of a family of wholly‑owned companies that operate within the following segments for financial reporting purposes:
 Energy Efficiency Services. Our Energy Efficiency Services segment consists of the business of our subsidiary, Willdan Energy Solutions, which offers energy efficiency and sustainability consulting services to utilities, public agencies and private industry under a variety of business names, including Willdan Energy Solutions, Abacus Resource Management, 360 Energy Engineers and Genesys Engineering. This segment is currently our largest segment based on contract revenue, representing approximately 68% and 55% of our consolidated contract revenue for fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 Engineering Services. Our Engineering Services segment includes the operations of our subsidiaries, Willdan Engineering, Willdan Infrastructure and Public Agency Resources (“PARs”). Willdan Engineering provides civil engineering‑related and city planning services, geotechnical and other engineering consulting services to our clients. Willdan Infrastructure, which was launched in fiscal year 2013, provides engineering services to larger rail, port, water, mining and other civil engineering projects. PARs primarily provides staffing to Willdan Engineering. Contract revenue for the Engineering Services segment represented approximately 25% and 34% of our overall consolidated contract revenue for fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively.

 Our Markets
 We provide energy efficiency, engineering and planning, economic and financial consulting and national preparedness and interoperability services primarily to public agencies and utilities, as well as private utilities and firms. We believe the market for these privatized governmental services is, and will be, driven by a number of factors, including:
· | Increased demand for services and solutions that provide energy efficiency, sustainability, water conservation, infrastructure development and renewable energy in the public and private sectors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Population growth, which leads to a need for increased capacity in government services and infrastructure;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Growth of small and medium sized communities, which creates the need to obtain highly specialized services without incurring the costs of hiring permanent staffing and the associated support structure;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Demand by constituents for a wider variety of services;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


· | The deterioration of local infrastructures, especially in aging areas; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Government funding programs and various state legislation that provide funds for local communities to provide services to their constituents.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Energy Efficiency and Sustainability Services
 In response to an increased awareness of global warming and climate change issues, private industry and public agencies are increasingly seeking out cost‑effective, turnkey solutions that provide innovative energy efficiency, renewable energy, water conservation and sustainability services. State and local governments are frequently turning to specialized resource conservation firms to strike the balance between environmental responsibility and economic competitiveness. Consultants have the expertise to develop efficient and cost effective solutions. The use of energy efficiency services, including audits, program design, benchmark analysis, metering and partnerships provides government agencies, utilities and private firms with the ability to realize long‑term savings. Engineering and Planning Services
 Engineering and planning services encompass a variety of disciplines associated with the design and construction of public infrastructure improvements. We expect continued population growth in California and other western states to place a significant strain on the infrastructure in those areas, driving the need for both new infrastructure and the rehabilitation of aging structures. Federal, state and local governments have responded to this need by proposing an increase in their funding of infrastructure related activities.  Economic and Financial Consulting
 Public agencies must raise the necessary funding to build, improve and maintain infrastructure and to provide services to their local communities. While tax revenue is the primary source of public agency funding, certain states, including California, impose property tax and spending limits that curtail the generation of such funds. Alternatives include the issuance of tax‑exempt securities; the formation of special financing districts to assess property owners on a parcel basis for infrastructure and public improvements, such as assessment districts and community facilities districts (known as Mello‑Roos districts in California); the implementation of development impact fee programs that require 

 
  2

 
developers to bear the cost of the impact of development on local infrastructure; user fee programs that pass costs along to the actual users of services; optimization of utility rates; and special taxes enacted by voters for specific purposes.
 Public agencies frequently contract with private consultants to provide advance studies, manage the processes and provide the administration necessary to support these methods. Consultants have the expertise necessary to form the special financing districts and produce an impact fee study used to develop a schedule of developer fees. Privatized services are also utilized to implement the programs or revised rate schedules, and in the case of special financing districts, administer the districts through the life of the bonds. Consultants also frequently provide the services necessary to comply with federal requirements for tax‑exempt debt, such as arbitrage rebate calculations and continuing disclosure reports. Use of such services allows public agencies to capitalize on innovative public finance techniques without incurring the cost of developing in‑house expertise.
 Homeland Security, National Preparedness and Interoperability Services
 After September 11, 2001, the need to protect civil infrastructure and implement additional security measures became a priority at all levels of government. In addition to the threat of terrorism, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and Superstorm Sandy highlighted the vulnerability of our country’s infrastructure to natural disasters, and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill along the Louisiana Gulf Coast emphasized the need for disaster preparedness. Such events place an increased burden on local and regional public agencies to be prepared to respond. In addition to fire and safety personnel, agencies responsible for the physical safety of infrastructure elements, such as water and wastewater systems, ports and airports, roads and highways, bridges and dams, are under increased pressure to prepare for natural and man‑made disasters. Accordingly, the federal government now considers public works staff members to be “first responders” to such incidents and we believe that agencies are allocating resources accordingly. Our Services
 We specialize in providing professional technical and consulting services to utilities, private industry and public agencies at all levels of government. Our core client base is composed of public and private utilities, commercial and industrial firms, cities, counties, special districts, other local and state agencies and tribal governments.
 We are organized to profitably manage numerous small to large contracts at the same time. Our contracts typically range from $1,000 to over $5,000,000 in contract revenue. Our contracts typically have a duration of between two and thirty-six months, although we have city services contracts that have been in effect for over 30 years. At December 30, 2016, we had approximately 2,082 open projects.
 Along with our more typical shorter-term projects, we also derive substantial revenue from two significant long-term contracts with Consolidated Edison of New York, Inc. (“Consolidated Edison”) and the Dormitory Authority-State of New York (“DASNY”). For the fiscal year 2016, Consolidated Edison and DASNY represented 21% and 22%, respectively, of our consolidated contract revenue. In January 2017, we announced a new three-year contract with Consolidated Edison to implement Consolidated Edison’s Commercial Direct Install (“CDI”) program across the utility's New York City and Westchester County service area. This new program replaces and expands Consolidated Edison's Small Business Direct Install (“SBDI”) program, which we had implemented since 2009, by increasing the size of eligible commercial customers and diversifying the program offerings. The Consolidated Edison contract continues through the end of 2019. The CDI program, Consolidated Edison's largest energy efficiency program, helps customers save energy, lower their bills and protect the environment by providing financial incentives to identify and buy down the cost of energy efficiency measures. To support this effort, we will provide full-service program implementation including outreach and direct sales to potential commercial customers, on-site energy efficiency assessments, direct implementation of energy savings measures and subcontractor management.  While the contract does not obligate Consolidated Edison to engage us for a minimum amount of services, the contract terms include an anticipated budget for our services of up to $75.0 million of services. Consolidated Edison may terminate the contract at any time for any reason. 
 Further, in connection with our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Genesys Engineering P.C. (“Genesys”), we entered into an administrative services agreement with Genesys pursuant to which our subsidiary, 

 
  3

 
Willdan Energy Solutions (“WES”), provides Genesys with ongoing administrative, operational and other non-professional support services. Under such administrative services agreement, WES provides administrative services for a series of Genesys’ DASNY contracts. WES provides administrative services to Genesys in its performance of rehabilitation and construction work and architectural and engineering services at various sites within New York State for DASNY under these contracts, including energy efficient design, utility cost evaluation and review, and various regulatory compliance services. Specific project descriptions are set out by DASNY in work authorizations, which are issued under the terms of the contracts. The termination dates of the DASNY contracts vary, the latest of which is currently February 13, 2019, but DASNY has the option to extend this contract term twice, one year at a time. DASNY may at any time terminate any of the contracts or suspend all projects, for its convenience and without cause.     We offer services in four segments: Energy Efficiency Services, Engineering Services, Public Finance Services, and Homeland Security Services. The interfaces and synergies among these segments are key elements of our strategy. Management established these segments based upon the services provided, the different marketing strategies associated with these services and the specialized needs of their respective clients. The following table presents, for the years indicated, the approximate percentage of our consolidated contract revenue attributable to each segment:

 | Fiscal Year | 
 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014 | 
Energy Efficiency Services | 68 | % | 55 | % | 49 | %
Engineering Services | 25 | % | 34 | % | 38 | %
Public Finance Services | 6 | % | 9 | % | 10 | %
Homeland Security Services | 1 | % | 2 | % | 3 | %

  See Note 13—“Segment Information” for additional segment information.
 Energy Efficiency Services
 We commenced providing energy efficiency services with the creation of our subsidiary, WES and its acquisition of Intergy Corporation in fiscal year 2008. Since then, we have grown our energy efficiency services segment through organic growth and through the acquisitions by WES of Abacus Resource Management Company (“Abacus”) and substantially all of the assets of 360 Energy Engineers, LLC (“360 Energy”) in January 2015 and substantially all of the assets of Genesys in March 2016.  
 WES is an energy efficiency consulting firm that provides specialized, innovative, comprehensive energy solutions nationwide to businesses, utilities, state agencies, municipalities, and non‑profit organizations.

  Engineering Services
 We provide a broad range of engineering‑related services to the public sector and limited services to the private sector. In general, contracts for engineering services (as opposed to construction contracts) are awarded by public agencies based primarily upon the qualifications of the engineering professional, rather than the proposed fees. We have longstanding relationships with many of these agencies and are recognized as an engineering consultant with relevant expertise and customer focused services. A substantial percentage of our engineering‑related work is for existing clients that we have served for many years.
 Our engineering‑related services are described individually below:

Our building and safety services range from managing and staffing an entire municipal building department to providing specific outsourced services, such as plan review and field inspections. Other related services that we offer under this umbrella include performing accessibility compliance and providing disaster recovery teams, energy compliance evaluations, permit processing and issuance, seismic retrofitting programs, and structural plan review. Many of our building and safety services engagements are with municipalities and counties where we supplement the capacity of in‑house staff.
 City Engineering. We specialize in providing engineering services tailored to the unique needs of municipalities. City engineering services range from staffing an entire engineering department to carrying out specific projects within a municipality, such as developing a pavement management program or reviewing engineering plans on behalf of a city. This service is the core of our original business and was the first service offered when we were founded.
 Code Enforcement. We assist municipalities with the development and implementation of neighborhood preservation programs and the staffing of code enforcement personnel. Our code enforcement and neighborhood preservation services include reviewing, studying and analyzing existing programs, developing and implementing community educational programs, developing ordinances and writing grant proposals, and providing project managers and/or supervisors.

  Public Finance Services
 Since 1999, our subsidiary Willdan Financial Services, a public finance consulting business, has supplemented the engineering services that we offer our clients. In general, we supply expertise and support for the various financing techniques employed by public agencies to finance their operations and infrastructure. We also support the mandated reporting and other requirements associated with these financings. We do not provide underwriting or financial advisory services for municipal securities.
 Unlike our Engineering Services business, we often compete for business, at least initially, through a competitive bid process. Agencies competitively bid out services on a regular basis. The new contract terms are generally one, three or five years per contract.
 Our services in this segment include the following:
 District Administration. We administer special districts on behalf of public agencies. The types of special districts administered include community facilities districts (in California, Mello‑Roos districts), assessment districts,

landscape and lighting districts, school facilities improvement districts, benefit assessment districts, fire suppression districts, and business improvement districts. Our administration services include calculating the annual levy for each parcel in the district; billing charges directly or through a county tax roll; preparing the annual Engineer’s Report, budget and resolutions; reporting on collections and payment status; calculating prepayment quotes; and providing financial analyses, modeling and budget forecasting.
 The key to our District Administration services is our proprietary software package, MuniMagicSM: Municipal Administration & Government Information Coordinator, which we developed internally to redefine the way we administer special districts. MuniMagicSM is a database management program that maintains parcel data; calculates special taxes, assessments, fees and charges; manages payment tracking; maintains bond‑related information in a single, central location; and provides reporting, financial modeling and analysis at multiple levels of detail. MuniMagicSM offers a significant competitive advantage in an industry driven by the ability to accurately process large quantities of data.
 Financial Consulting. We perform economic analyses and financial projects for public agencies, including:

· | Fee and rate studies, such as cost allocation studies and user fee analysis;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Utility rate analysis for water, wastewater and storm water;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | Utility system appraisals and acquisitions;
--+--------------------------------------------


· | Fiscal and economic impact analysis;
--+-------------------------------------


· | Strategic economic development and redevelopment plans;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


· | Real estate and market analysis associated with planning efforts, and development fee studies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Proposition 218 studies, assessment balloting, and re‑engineering;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Special district formation, which involves the feasibility determinations, design, development and initiation of community facilities districts, school facilities improvement districts, tax increment financing districts, assessment districts, landscape and lighting districts, benefit assessment districts, business improvement districts, and fire suppression assessments;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Other special projects, including facility financing plans, formation of new public entities, annexations and incorporations; reassessment engineering and financial analysis for bond offerings or refundings; development and financial projections; and nexus studies between public and private enterprises, including public‑private partnerships and the benefits of economic development to municipalities and to state, provincial, regional and national governments.

  Federal Compliance. We offer federal compliance services to issuers of municipal securities, which can be cities, towns, school districts, housing authorities, and other entities that are eligible to issue tax‑exempt securities. Specifically, we provide arbitrage rebate calculations and municipal disclosure services that help issuers remain in compliance with federal regulations. We provide these reports, together with related compliance services such as bond elections, temporary period yield restriction, escrow fund monitoring, rebate payments, and refund requests. In terms of continuing disclosure services, we both produce the required annual reports and disseminate those reports on behalf of the issuers. We provide federal compliance services to approximately 750 issuers in 42 states and the District of Columbia on more than 2,500 bond issues totaling over $60 billion in municipal debt.
 Representative Projects. Examples of typical projects we have in the Public Finance Services segment include:

· | Property Assessed Clean Energy (“PACE”). PACE is a financing mechanism that enables low-cost, long-term funding for energy efficiency, renewable energy and water conservation projects. PACE financing is repaid as an assessment on the property’s regular tax bill, and is processed the same way as other local public benefit assessments that have been utilized for decades. Depending on local legislation, PACE can be used to pay for new heating and cooling systems, solar panels, insulation and more for commercial,

nonprofit and residential properties. This allows property owners to implement improvements without a large up-front cash payment. We have partnered with Ygrene Energy Fund to provide a national PACE program. The program spans over forty counties in California and multiple counties in Florida, and it is currently expanding into Missouri and Georgia. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (“MEAG”) Power. We are preparing a white paper on the potential impact of Distributed Energy Resources (“DER”) such as rooftop solar on member revenue sufficiency. MEAG's 45 members must service MEAG Power's $7 billion of debt. The analysis summarizes retail ratemaking options for DERs in the US and Georgia as well as recent trends. For each member city, we are evaluating the potential revenue shortfalls given various DER rate designs and levels of DER deployment. Results of this study will be used to quantify the risk and demonstrate mitigation strategies for the rating agencies. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | County of Santa Barbara, California. In 2002, the State of California passed a community choice aggregation (“CCA”) law as part of its electric restructuring legislation. CCA is a state policy that enables local governments to aggregate electricity demand within their jurisdictions in order to procure alternative energy supplies while maintaining the existing electricity provider for transmission and distribution services. Since the passage of the legislation, many agencies have been looking into this alternative means to procure energy. We were selected by the County of Santa Barbara to conduct a CCA feasibility study for the Central Coast Region; efforts will include 3 counties—Santa Barbara, Ventura, and San Luis Obispo, at least 17 participating cities within the tri-county region, and the territories of two investor owned utilities, namely Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Company. We are currently conducting a similar study for the City of San Diego.

· | City of Plano, Texas, Rate Methodology Assessment. We were retained by the City of Plano, Texas, and other member cities of the North Texas Municipal Water District, to complete an assessment of the rate methodology used to charge member and customer cities. The district consists of 13 member cities and 33 customer cities from the North Dallas area, serving 1.6 million consumers. The project consists of evaluating the current rate methodology and recommending alternatives to more equitably allocate costs amongst member cities and to customer cities. In order to achieve this objective, and have a platform to best communicate results, we developed an interactive model to simulate changes in rate methodology.

  Homeland Security Services
 In fiscal year 2004, we formed our subsidiary Willdan Homeland Solutions, formerly known as American Homeland Solutions. Willdan Homeland Solutions provides emergency preparedness planning, emergency preparedness training, emergency preparedness exercises, communications and technology, and water security services that focus on integrating local resources and assets within state and federal systems to cities, counties and related municipal service agencies, such as utility and water companies, as well as school districts, port and transportation authorities, tribal governments and large business enterprises with a need for homeland security related services. We staff our projects in this area with former high‑level local and regional public safety officers and focus on solutions tailored for local agencies and their personnel. Our services include the following:
 Emergency Preparedness Planning. We design, develop, implement, review and evaluate public and private agencies’ emergency operations and hazard mitigation plans, including compliance and consistency with federal, state and local laws and policies. Plans are tailored to respond to terrorism, intentional acts of sabotage and natural disasters. We also provide command and control and emergency response training for all types of unusual occurrences. We have developed emergency operations, hazard mitigation, continuity of operations and business continuity and recovery plans for municipal governments, special districts school districts, and private‑industry clients.
 Emergency Preparedness Training. We design customized training courses for all aspects of disaster, unusual occurrence and emergency responses. In this regard, we have developed and own several training courses that meet or 

 
  11

 
exceed the requirements for the federal National Incident Management System (“NIMS”) training. These courses assist clients in meeting their obligations to prepare their staff to utilize the NIMS. 
 Emergency Preparedness Exercises. We conduct planning sessions and exercises, including those relating to weapons of mass destruction, large events, mass casualty transportation disasters, terrorism incident response, natural disaster response and recovery and civil disorder events. We design these exercises for multi‑agency involvement so they are fully compliant with the federal government’s Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program, the State Emergency Management System for California, and the National Response Framework. Exercises are designed to evaluate and test first responders and support personnel, as well as elected officials and agency management.
 Communications and Technology. We provide homeland security, public safety and emergency response capabilities for government and corporate clients that focus on integrating local resources and assets within federal, state and local systems. Core competencies include requirements development, integration, life cycle analysis, system design, procurement and selection, deployment, interoperability, project management, quality management, assessments, conceptual and final design and gap analysis in the public safety radio, land mobile communications and corporate market including broadband networks, commercial cellular test plans, data networks, microwave network planning and related engineering design.
 Water Security. We offer NIMS and Incident Command System courses specific to water and wastewater agencies. Our instructors and course facilitators have significant experience in water and wastewater security, emergency preparedness, and business continuity. All courses are certified by the US Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). Eligible agencies may use DHS Transit Security Grant Program funds for this approved training. The program is one in a number of comprehensive measures authorized by congress to directly support transportation infrastructure security activities.
 Representative Projects. Examples of typical Homeland Security Services projects include:

· | San Francisco Bay Area, Urban Areas Security Initiative (“UASI”) Exercise Program. We provided the San Francisco Bay Area UASI with emergency management exercise services, in support of the design, development and delivery of Yellow Command, the Functional Exercise element of the Urban Shield Full-Scale Exercise series, since its inception in 2013. This exercise has the objective to engage all levels of emergency operation centers (“EOC”) in the region, and promote coordination between jurisdictions and agencies in response to a catastrophic incident (or incidents) occurring throughout the region. The exercises in this series consist of both full-scale and functional components, as defined by Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program (“HSEEP”) methodology, and encompass notification, communication and on-scene response operations.

· | Anaheim/Santa Ana UASI, Training & Exercise Program. Since 2008, our staff has supported the Anaheim/Santa Ana UASI Training and Exercise Program, providing more than 100 tabletop, functional and full-scale exercises, as well as strategic and operational planning and city and county EOC and National Incident Management System/Incident Command System training. The primary objective of this program is to prepare the region to respond to a wide-range of natural, human-caused and/or technological disasters and emergencies, and we work on a daily basis with all of the region’s public safety agencies, emergency management and public health officials, as well as regional partners and stakeholders to help meet this objective. For all exercises, we are responsible for planning and leading exercise planning and design, developing all HSEEP compliant exercise documents and facilitating exercise evaluation, including writing the After Action Report/Improvement Plans.

      Competitive Strengths
 We provide a wide range of privatized services to the public sector, private firms and utilities. We have developed the experience base, professional staff and support technology and software necessary to quickly and effectively respond to the needs of our clients. We believe we have developed a reputation within our industry as problem solvers across a broad range of client issues. Some of our competitive strengths include:

 
  12

 

 Quality of service. We pride ourselves on the quality of service that we provide to our clients. The work for which we compete is awarded primarily based on the company’s qualifications, rather than the fees proposed. We believe that our service levels, experience and expertise satisfy even the most rigorous qualification standards. We have developed a strong reputation for quality, based upon our depth of experience, ability to attract quality professionals, customized technology and software that support our services, local knowledge and the expertise we possess across multiple disciplines. We believe we are well‑positioned to serve utilities and public sector clients due to our knowledge of the unique reporting processes and operating procedures of utilities and public agencies, which differ substantially from the private sector. 
 Broad range of services. Our focus on customer service has led us to continually broaden the scope of the services we provide. While we started as an engineering business, at different stages in our history, as the needs of our clients have evolved, we have expanded into new services, such as energy efficiency and homeland security services, and developed complementary service capabilities, including building and safety services, financial and economic services, planning services, geotechnical services, code enforcement services. Further, because we recognize that local public sector projects and issues often cross departmental lines, we have developed the ability to deliver multiple services in a cohesive manner to better serve our client communities as a whole.
 Strategic locations in key markets. Local agencies want professionals who understand their local needs. Therefore, we deliver our services through a network of offices dispersed throughout the United States in: Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Kansas, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington and Washington, D.C. Each of our offices is staffed with quality professionals, including former management level public sector employees, such as planners, engineers, inspectors, and police and fire department personnel. These professionals understand the local and regional markets in which they work.
 Strong, long‑term client relationships. We have developed strong relationships with our public agency clients, some of whom we have worked with for over 42 years. The value of these long‑term relationships is reflected in the recurring award of new projects, ongoing staffing assignments, and long‑term projects that require high‑level supervision. We also seek to maintain close personal relationships with public agency decision‑makers to strengthen our relationships with them and the agencies with which they work. We frequently develop new client relationships as our public agency contacts are promoted or move to other agencies. Our strong culture of community involvement and leadership in key public agency organizations underscores our customer focus and helps us cultivate and expand our client base.
 Experienced, talented and motivated employees. Our staff consists of seasoned professionals with a broad array of specialties, and a strong customer service orientation. Our corporate culture places a high priority on investing in our people, including providing opportunities for stock ownership to attract, motivate and retain top professionals. Our executive officers have an average of more than 38 years of experience in the engineering and consulting industry, and an average of 10 years with our company.
 Clients
 Our clients primarily consist of investor owned utilities, public and governmental agencies including cities, counties, redevelopment agencies, water districts, school districts and universities, state agencies, federal agencies and a variety of other special districts and agencies. We also provide services to private utilities and private industry. In fiscal year 2016, we served over 953 distinct clients. For fiscal year 2016, two clients accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated contract revenue.  Consolidated Edison and DASNY accounted for 21% and 22%, respectively, of our consolidated contract revenue for fiscal year 2016.  Our clients are primarily based in California and New York. In fiscal year 2016, services provided to clients in California accounted for approximately 33% of our contract revenue and services provided to clients in New York accounted for approximately 45% of our contract revenue. Contract Structure
 We generally provide our services under contracts, purchase orders or retainer letters. The agreements we enter into with our clients typically incorporate one of three principal types of pricing provisions:

 
  13

 


· | Time and materials provisions provide for reimbursement of costs and overhead plus a fee for labor based on the time expended on a project multiplied by a negotiated hourly billing rate. The profitability achievable on a time and materials basis is driven by billable headcount and cost control.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Unit based provisions require the delivery of specific units of work, such as arbitrage rebate calculations, dissemination of municipal securities continuing disclosure reports, or building plan checks, at an agreed price per unit, with the total payment under the contract determined by the actual number of units performed.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Fixed price provisions require all work under a contract to be performed for a specified lump sum, which may be subject to adjustment if the scope of the project changes. Contracts with fixed price provisions carry certain inherent risks, including risks of losses from underestimating costs, delays in project completion, problems with new technologies, price increases for materials, and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period. Consequently, the profitability, if any, of fixed price contracts can vary substantially.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the approximate percentage of our contract revenue subject to each type of pricing provision:

 | Fiscal Year | 
 | 2016 | | 2015 | 
Time and materials | 24 | % | 31 | %
Unit based | 30 | % | 34 | %
Fixed price | 46 | % | 35 | %
Total | 100 | % | 100 | %

  In relation to the pricing provisions, our service-related contracts, including operations and maintenance services and a variety of technical assistance services, are accounted for over the period of performance, in proportion to the costs of performance. Award and incentive fees are recorded when they are fixed and determinable and consider customer contract terms.
 For time and materials and fixed price contracts, we bill our clients periodically in accordance with the contract terms based on costs incurred, on either an hourly fee basis or on a percentage of completion basis, as the project progresses. For unit based contracts, we bill our clients upon delivery of the contracted item or service, and in some cases, in advance of delivery.
 Our contracts come up for renewal periodically and at the time of renewal may be subject to renegotiation, which could impact the profitability on that contract. In addition, during the term of a contract, public agencies may request additional or revised services which may impact the economics of the transaction. Most of our contracts permit our clients, with prior notice, to terminate the contracts at any time without cause. While we have a large volume of transactions and generally low customer concentration, the renewal, termination or modification of a contract may have a material effect on our consolidated operations.
 Competition
 The market for our services is highly fragmented. We often compete with many other firms ranging from small local firms to large national firms. Contract awards are based primarily on qualifications, relevant experience, staffing capabilities, geographic presence, stability and price.
 Doing business with utilities and governmental agencies is complex and requires the ability to comply with intricate regulations and satisfy periodic audits. We have been serving cities, counties, special districts and other public agencies for over 50 years. We believe that the ability to understand these requirements and to successfully conduct business with utilities, governmental entities and agencies is a barrier to entry for potential competitors.

 
  14

 

 Our competition varies by type of client, type of service and geography. The range of competitors for any one project can vary depending upon technical specialties, the relative value of the project, geographic location, financial terms, risks associated with the work, and any client imposed restrictions. Unlike most of our competitors, we focus our services on utilities and public sector clients. Utility and public sector clients generally choose among competing firms by weighing the quality, experience, innovation and timeliness of the firm’s services. When selecting consultants for engineering projects, many utilities and government agencies are required to, and others choose to, employ Qualifications Based Selection (“QBS”). QBS requires the selection of the most technically qualified firms for a project, while the financial and legal terms of the engagement are generally secondary. 
 Our competition varies geographically. Although we provide services in several states, we may be stronger in certain service lines in some geographical areas than in other regions. Similarly, some of our larger competitors are stronger in some service lines in certain localities but are not as competitive in others. Our smaller competitors generally are limited both geographically as well as by the services they are able to provide.
 We believe that our Energy Efficiency Services segment competes primarily with Lockheed‑Martin, EnerPath, KEMA (a division of the DNV Group), Clear Result, AM Conservation Group ,Inc., Ameresco, Inc., Lime Energy, ICF International, Inc., and Nexant, Inc. We believe that the primary competitors for our Engineering Services segment include Charles Abbott & Associates, Inc., Harris & Associates, RBF Consulting, Tetra Tech, Inc., Stantec, Inc., Michael Baker Corporation, TRC Companies, Inc., AECOM Technology Corporation, NV5 Holdings, Inc., Ecology & Environment, Inc., Iteris, Inc., Versar, Inc., CH2M Hill and Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc. Our chief competitors in our Public Finance Services segment include David Taussig & Associates, Harris & Associates, BLX Group, Arbitrage Compliance Specialists, Raftelis Financial Consultants, Inc., FCS Group and the NBS Government Finance Group. We believe the Homeland Security Services segment competes primarily with Leidos (formerly Science Applications International Corporation or SAIC) and IEM, Inc.
 Insurance
 We currently maintain the following insurance coverage: commercial general liability with limits of $1.0 million per occurrence and $2.0 million general aggregate; automobile liability insurance with limits of $1.0 million per occurrence; and workers’ compensation and employer’s liability with limits of $1.0 million per occurrence. We also carry professional liability insurance with a deductible of $250,000 and limits of $7.5 million per claim and $15.0 million annual aggregate and an umbrella/excess liability insurance of $25.0 million. We are liable to pay these claims from our assets if and when the aggregate settlement or judgment amount exceeds our policy limits. Employees
 At December 30, 2016, we had approximately 615 full‑time employees and 216 part‑time employees. All Public Agency Resources’ employees are classified as part‑time. Our employees include, among others, licensed electrical, mechanical, structural and civil engineers, land surveyors, certified building officials, licensed geotechnical engineers and engineering geologists, certified inspectors and plans examiners, licensed architects and landscape architects, certified planners, and information technology specialists. We believe that we attract and retain highly skilled personnel with significant industry experience and strong client relationships by offering them challenging assignments in a stable work environment. We believe that our employee relations are good.
