ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 Core Laboratories N.V. is a Netherlands limited liability company. We were established in 1936 and are one of the world's leading providers of proprietary and patented reservoir description and production enhancement services and products to the oil and gas industry. These services and products can enable our clients to improve reservoir performance and increase oil and gas recovery from their producing fields. We have over 70 offices in more than 50 countries and have approximately 3,700 employees.
 References to "Core Lab", "the Company", "we", "our", and similar phrases are used throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Form 10-K") and relate collectively to Core Laboratories N.V. and its consolidated affiliates.
 In a continuing effort to streamline our business and align our business strategy for further integration of services and products, the Company committed to divest the business of our full range of permanent downhole monitoring systems and related services, which had been part of our Production Enhancement segment. We completed the divestment of this business in 2019 and concluded the final adjustment to the purchase agreement in 2020; the disclosure relating to the divestment of this business is included in Note 20 - Discontinued Operations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV of this Form 10-K (“Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements”). All prior period income statements have been adjusted to reclassify amounts related to this business to discontinued operations to conform to current period presentation. All disclosures on operating income and net income within these statements reflect the results from continuing operations for all periods presented. These reclassifications had no impact on the reported net income attributable to Core Laboratories N.V., financial position or cash flows for any of these prior periods.
 Business Strategy
 Our business strategy is to provide advanced technologies that improve reservoir performance by (i) continuing the development of proprietary technologies through client-driven research and development, (ii) expanding the services and products offered throughout our global network of offices and (iii) acquiring complementary technologies that add key technologies or market presence and enhance existing services and products.
Development of New Technologies, Services and Products
 We conduct research and development to meet the needs of our clients who are continually seeking new services and technologies to lower their costs of finding, developing and producing oil and gas. While the aggregate number of wells being drilled per year has fluctuated relative to market conditions, oil and gas producers have, on a proportional basis, increased expenditures on technology services to improve their understanding of the reservoir and increase production of oil and gas from their producing fields. We intend to continue concentrating our efforts on services and technologies that improve reservoir performance and increase oil and gas recovery.
International Expansion of Services and Products
 Another component of our business strategy is to broaden the spectrum of services and products offered to our clients on a global basis. We intend to continue using our worldwide network of offices to offer our services and products that have been developed internally or obtained through acquisitions. This global emphasis allows us to enhance our revenue through efficient utilization of our worldwide network.
Acquisitions
 We continually review potential acquisitions to add key services and technologies, enhance market presence or complement existing businesses.
 More information relating to any significant acquisitions is included in Note 4 - Acquisitions of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Operations
 We derive our revenue from services and product sales to clients primarily in the oil and gas industry.

 We offer our services worldwide through a global network of offices. Services accounted for 77%, 71% and 69% of our revenue from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 We manufacture products primarily in five facilities for distribution on a global basis. Product sales accounted for 23%, 29% and 31% of our revenue from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 Reservoir Description
 Commercial oil and gas fields consist of porous and permeable reservoir rocks that contain crude oil, natural gas and formation water. Due to the density differences of the fluids, natural gas typically caps the field and overlies an oil layer, which overlies the water. We provide services that characterize the porous reservoir rock, all three reservoir fluids and their derived products. Services relating to these fluids include determining the quality and measuring the quantity of the reservoir fluids and their derived products. This includes determining the value of different crude oil and natural gases by analyzing the individual components of complex hydrocarbons. We measure reservoir hydrocarbons at reservoir conditions to determine the changes in their physical properties with changing pressure and temperature. The number of pressure-volume-temperature ("PVT") related projects, has been increasing for the last several years, and reservoir fluid analyses now contribute approximately 60% of Reservoir Description revenue.
 We analyze samples of reservoir rocks for their porosity, which determines reservoir storage capacity, and for their permeability, which defines the ability of the fluids to flow through the rock. These measurements are used to determine how much oil and gas are present in a reservoir and the rates at which the oil and gas can be produced. We also use our proprietary services and technologies to correlate the reservoir description data to wireline logs and other subsurface data.
 The combined use of both the reservoir rock and fluid data are invaluable to oil companies to determine the most efficient method by which to recover, process and refine these hydrocarbons to produce the maximum value added to crude oil and natural gas fields. Early evaluations and key decisions about well performance and viability are important for optimizing a reservoir. This is accomplished by using proprietary and patented laboratory methods, including both traditional physical measurements and more recently introduced new technologies, such as Core Lab’s Non-Invasive Technologies for Reservoir OptimizationSM (“NITROSM”) services. NITROSM services includes Dual Energy Computed Tomography ("DECT"), Micro Computed Tomography, high and low frequency nuclear magnetic resonance, high-resolution gamma logging and continuous high energy x-ray fluorescence, along with other Core Lab proprietary technologies.
 Core Lab's proprietary DECT scanner-based deliverables generate millimeter-scale three dimensional images and accompanying high-resolution petrophysical logs on cored intervals by calibrating DECT information to the vast library of physical measurements in Core Lab's proprietary database. The DECT deliverables from Core Lab are more detailed than down-hole logs and provide better bed resolution as well as accurate information on rock properties such as lithology, porosity, density, rock strength and acoustic velocities.
 DECT, when combined with Continuous Dual Gamma and Scanning X-ray Fluorescence (“CS-XRF”), allows Core Lab to assess continuous high-resolution elemental composition of the cored intervals. A proprietary formation-specific “inversion” technique can be used to convert the detailed elemental composition to a continuous mineral log enabling us to generate detailed lithologic descriptions of the reservoir and to perform a comprehensive reservoir characterization.
 Core Lab conducts a wide variety of physical laboratory measurements to measure and evaluate fluid flow through the rock, often at in-situ reservoir temperatures and pressures. These are most commonly applied to conventional reservoirs. We have also developed unique analytical processes to understand the flow characteristics and saturation profiles of unconventional reservoir systems including (1) High Frequency Nuclear Magnetic Resonance measurements to gain insights into movable vs. 
 2


non-movable fluid saturations of these complex systems; and (2) Enhanced Oil Recovery of shale reservoirs by evaluating the effectiveness of gas cycling in nano-pore structures to significantly increase long-term production rates and volumes.
 Core Lab has been at the forefront of digital transformation technologies for more than two decades.  Core Lab’s extensive, proprietary databases and analog technologies, coupled with artificial intelligence (“AI”) and machine learning, help our clients improve efficiencies and lower operating costs throughout the upstream value chain. The analysis and integration, of these critical datasets is enhanced because of Core Lab’s proprietary RAPIDTM database. Core Lab’s proprietary World Wide Rock CatalogTM provides a database and analog reference set for predicting properties when physical measurements are unavailable.
 Core Lab’s Digital Innovation Group integrates results and interpretations into a comprehensive, web-enabled platform, RAPIDTM, for client access. This allows our clients to gain insight into their core intervals at an accelerated pace, for both non-invasive technologies as well as time-honored physical laboratory measurements. Through this integrated visually interactive platform, key reservoir performance indicators are presented, evaluated and shared within client workgroups.
 During 2020, Core Lab’s Digital Innovation Group worked collaboratively with multiple international and national oil companies on projects that utilize several of Core Lab’s proprietary digital technologies and services. Core Lab’s proprietary Advanced Rock Typing technology combines Core Lab’s vast, comprehensive database of physical measurements, and World Wide Rock CatalogTM with its proprietary image acquisition technology and innovative AI image recognition. These technologies provide clients with analog data sets in situations where acquisition of new conventional core may not be possible. High-resolution images of wellbore cuttings and sidewall cores are quickly and efficiently matched with analogs from Core Lab’s proprietary database of samples from around the world. Physically measured data sets from the matching analogs are delivered to our clients in time to make appraisal and development decisions.
 Core Lab also applies its rock fluid and data analytical capabilities to CO2 and other gas and liquid projects. These projects may be for enhanced oil recovery in mature fields, or for CO2-Carbon Capture and Sequestration projects.
 Core Lab holds various patents, trade secrets, and proprietary designs for laboratory equipment required to analyze reservoir rocks as well as the properties and phase behavior of reservoir fluids and derived products. We manufacture a wide range of ambient and reservoir condition rock and fluid analysis laboratory equipment for our own use throughout our international laboratory network. Among these devices are complex, high-pressure, high temperature, reservoir condition, multi-phase flow systems and full visualization PVT cells, along with the ancillary equipment required to support these laboratory programs. We also sell equipment of this type to universities, government institutes, and client company research labs.
 While recognizing the need to optimize the logistical chain of our clients, from producing well to retail sales of petroleum products, a state-of-the-art IT platform CONNECT: was launched to efficiently acquire our field data, laboratory analysis, optimize workflows and any other observations relevant to our client base. The system is designed for single data entry, and that data can be used for further analysis and, more importantly, be shared with our clients by process flow dashboards with key performance indicators. The system can also share real-time data on mobile devices, enabling our clients to make quick decisions. This methodology of sharing data has been embraced by an increasing number of clients, as it has not only saved them costs, but, more importantly, the data can be used for trend analysis in many ways, such as the ability to forecast bottlenecks, thus eliminating waste and increasing efficiency. Two experience centers have been set up, in the U.S. and Europe, where our clients can get acquainted with optimizing the flow of business as well as our advanced systems for data analysis. All initiatives are meant to increase efficiency and add value to our client base. All data is being made available through dashboard technology, which for internal purposes is being used to measure the efficiency of workflows throughout the organization. 
 Further development continues in 2021, new modules continue to be added to our suite of IT platforms that enhance the distribution chain of our customers, with similar structure of using dashboard technology, enabling the customer to monitor live progress as well as operational data.
 We conduct numerous large-scale, multi-company reservoir management projects, applying proprietary and state-of-the-art techniques from the earliest phases of a field development program until the last economic barrel of oil is recovered. We initiate and deliver a group of international and U.S. based consortium studies to evaluate both conventional and unconventional reservoirs. These projects are of increasing importance to oil companies as the incremental barrel is often the lowest cost and most profitable barrel in the reservoir. Producing incremental barrels increases our clients' cash flows which we believe will result in additional capital expenditures by our clients, and ultimately further opportunities for us.
 These industry consortium projects provide critical reservoir information to a broad spectrum of clients in a cost effective manner. These studies focus on regions of client interest across the globe, and include both conventional and unconventional reservoir targets. Studies often run for several years and new studies are initiated in response of current or upcoming client activity in a region. Core Lab retains rights of ownership to complete joint industry projects studies, which can be resold at a later date. Many of them examine unconventional reservoirs, particularly in the US and Canada. For example, our Permian 
 3


Basin study evaluates the petrophysical, geochemical, completion and production characteristics of this very active play in West Texas. Our clients use this information, not only to improve their drilling and production activities, but also to evaluate potential acquisition and divestiture opportunities.
 Production Enhancement
 We provide products and diagnostic services to help optimize well completions, reservoir operations and field development strategies in order to increase recoverable reserves in the most efficient way. Our product offerings focus on perforating technologies to establish communication between the wellbore and the reservoir. Our diagnostic services are used to access well completions and field floods. Two production enhancement methods commonly used are (i) hydraulic fracturing of the reservoir rock to improve flow and (ii) flooding a reservoir with water, carbon dioxide, nitrogen or hydrocarbon gases to drive more oil and gas to the producing wellbores. Many oilfields today are hydraulically fractured and/or flooded to maximize oil and gas recovery. Although Core Lab is not a hydraulic fracturing company, we do provide services that are used by others to develop and optimize hydraulic fracturing and field flood projects and to evaluate the success of those projects. Our services, products and expertise play a key role in the success of both methods.
 The hydraulic fracturing of a producing formation is achieved by pumping a fluid slurry containing a proppant material into the reservoir zone at extremely high pressures. This fractures the rock and the proppant material "props" or holds the fractures open after the pressure pumping is complete so that reservoir fluids can flow to the production wellbore. Data on rock type and strength generated in our Reservoir Description segment are critical for determining the proper design of the hydraulic fracturing job. In addition, our testing indicates whether the fluid slurry is compatible with the reservoir rock so that damage does not occur that would otherwise restrict production. We also provide testing of various propping agents and software to help pick the best proppant based on net present value calculations of client investments. Our proprietary and patented ZERO WASH® tracer technology is used to determine cluster efficiency and ensure maximum stimulated reservoir volume and increased ultimate recovery.
 SPECTRACHEM®, a chemical frac water tracer, is another proprietary and patented technology developed for optimizing hydraulic fracture performance. SPECTRACHEM® is used to aid operators in determining the efficiency of the fracture fluids used. SPECTRACHEM® tracers allow operators to evaluate the quantity of fracture fluid that returns to the wellbore during the clean-up period after a hydraulic fracturing event. This technology also allows our clients to evaluate load recovery, gas breakthrough, fluid leak-off and breaker efficiency, all of which are important factors for optimizing oil and/or natural gas production after the formation is hydraulically fractured.
 The SPECTRACHEM® service is used for determining the effectiveness and efficiency of the hydraulic fracture stimulation of long, multi-stage horizontal wells in oil- and gas-shale plays in unconventional reservoirs. SPECTRACHEM® data sets are used to determine how each frac stage is flowing. Frac stages with ineffective flows may warrant further stimulation, remedial actions and guide improvements on future frac designs.
 During 2020, our engineers developed and introduced a new application for our proprietary SPECTRACHEM ® to determine whether horizontal wells are unobstructed and flowing through the entire length of a lateral well.  Leveraged by operators in the Permian, Eagle Ford, and Haynesville, this technology can identify wellbore obstructions, often caused by inter-well communication or dissolvable plug remnants.  By applying this technology, our clients can identify and remediate well obstructions that can negatively impact well performance, reserve calculations and reserve-based lending.
 Our unique completion monitoring system, COMPLETION PROFILER™, helps to determine flow rates from reservoir zones after they have been hydraulically fractured. This provides our clients with a baseline of early production information and can be compared to subsequent images later in the life of the well to see how hydrocarbon production from different reservoir layers or different quality rock varies over time.
 Our FLOWPROFILERTM service, a proprietary hydrocarbon-based tracer technology, which is a further development of our patented SPECTRACHEM® technology quantifies the hydrocarbon production from discrete segments in multi-stage horizontal well completions and stimulations in unconventional tight-oil or gas plays. We have tracers used for oil reservoirs which are different from our tracers used for gas reservoirs. FLOWPROFILERTM technology and the analytical methodology for identifying the hydrocarbon-soluble tracers are the protected intellectual property of Core Lab.
 FLOWPROFILERTM technology employs a unique hydrocarbon-soluble tracer and water-soluble tracer introduced into specific and isolated stages via the stimulating proppant stream. The hydrocarbon-soluble tracers are absorbed by the crude oil and gas associated with each stage, while the water-soluble tracer remains in the stimulation fluid. When the well is flowed, oil, gas and water samples are collected and analyzed in the laboratory to identify and quantify oil or gas flows from each stage as well as the cleanup of the stimulation fluid. Stages not at optimum flow rates can be identified, precipitating remedial efforts to increase flow and recovery rates, and providing valuable insight for future wells. This service is being used to monitor offset 
 4


well interference by sampling offset well oil, gas and water production. The amount of tracer detected in offset wells is being used to help our clients optimize both lateral and vertical well spacing and the amount of fracturing fluids for each stage.
 We continue to see broadening acceptance of FLOWPROFILERTMEDS, a proprietary technology, which is an engineered delivery system ("EDS"). The break-through EDS technology delivers time-released diagnostics for evaluating the crude-oil flow from each stage of a hydraulically fractured completion. This technology comprises proprietary 40/70 or 100 mesh particles, chemically engineered to bond specifically with our proprietary oil tracers. This allows for precise placement of tracers in the propped fracture providing accurate identification of oil production by stage. Crude-oil production by stage is determined by using this Core Lab-developed technology that enables the diagnostic tracer to be absorbed and chemically-bonded to durable, proppant-size particles that accompany the frac sand. The tracer will release from the engineered particles once they contact the reservoir's crude oil, enabling Core Lab to assess which stages are contributing to crude-oil production.
 We conduct dynamic flow tests of the reservoir fluids through the reservoir rock, at actual reservoir pressure and temperature, to realistically simulate the actual flooding of a producing zone. We use patented technologies, such as our Saturation Monitoring by the Attenuation of X-rays ("SMAXTM"), to help design the enhanced recovery project. After a field flood is initiated, we are often involved in monitoring the progress of the flood to ensure the maximum amount of incremental production is being achieved through the use of our SPECTRAFLOODTM technology, which we developed to optimize sweep efficiency during field floods.
 Our PACKSCAN® patented technology is used to evaluate gravel pack effectiveness in unconsolidated reservoirs. PACKSCAN® measures the density changes in the gravel pack annulus to verify the completeness of the gravel pack protection of the wellbore without any additional rig time.
 In addition to Core Lab's many patented reservoir diagnostic technologies, Production Enhancement has established itself as a global leader in the manufacturing and distribution of high-performance perforating products. Core Lab's unique understanding of complex reservoirs supports our ability to supply perforating systems engineered to maximize well productivity by reducing, eliminating and overcoming formation damage caused during the drilling and completion of oil and gas wells. This "systems" approach to the perforation of an oil or gas well has resulted in numerous patented products.
 HEROTM ("High Efficiency Reservoir Optimization") and SuperHEROTM are examples of the patented perforating systems which quickly gained market acceptance and became industry leaders in enhancing reservoir performance. The SuperHEROTM charge evolved from the HEROTM charge technology and use a proprietary and patented design of powdered metal liners and explosives technology resulting in a deeper and cleaner perforating tunnel into the oil and gas reservoir. This allows greater flow of hydrocarbons to the wellbore and helps to maximize hydrocarbon recovery from the reservoir. The more recent charge development of the HERO-HRTM (Hard Rock) charges, resulted in Core Lab also having the deepest penetrating perforating charges on the market as certified by API testing.
 HEROTMPerFRAC leverages the HEROTM technology. In addition to the benefits of HEROTM technology, HEROTMPerFRAC charges are designed specifically for optimizing fracture stimulation well completions by providing a uniform hole size which minimizes tortuosity effects. This results in less required surface horsepower and less time which both translate into lower costs needed to complete the fracturing operation. In addition to optimizing stimulation operations with faster, lower cost programs, well production is also enhanced by not only the better well stimulations but the improved near debris free perforation tunnels as the well fluids come back into the casing from the rock. Core Lab's manufacturing operations in the United States and Canada continue to meet the global demand for our perforating systems through facility expansion in addition to gains in efficiency and productivity.
 Consistent with the HEROTMPerFRAC uniform hole size option, the ReFRAC product line was also introduced and has experienced increasing client acceptance. The ReFRAC technology is utilized in mechanically isolated re-stimulation programs where the internal string is used to isolate older, depleted stages in previously under-stimulated wells. The ReFRAC technology creates a uniform hole size through two strings of casing. This re-completion method is gaining popularity because it allows operators to perforate, pump and stimulate new rock between the original stages of the well, increasing hydrocarbon recovery without the expense of drilling and completing a new well. Operators using Core Lab’s ReFRAC technology have reported they can now complete twice as many stages per day compared to conventional perforating systems, reducing their operating costs and improving cash flow.
 The HEROTM line of perforating charges, HEROTMPerFRAC, SuperHEROTM, HERO-HRTM and ReFRAC charges can eliminate the ineffective perforations that would otherwise limit daily oil and natural gas production and hinder the optimal fracture stimulation programs needed for prolific production from the Permian Basin, Bakken, Eagle Ford, Marcellus, Niobrara and similar oil- and gas-shale formations.
 Core Lab acquired Guardian Global Technologies Ltd. ("Guardian") in 2018. Based in Pyle, Wales, Guardian is a technologically sophisticated designer and manufacturer of downhole instrumentation utilized by international oil and gas 
 5


operators for well completions. Guardian’s proprietary downhole energetic solutions are designed to systemize, simplify, automate, and de-risk the deployment of perforating systems. The Ballistics Delivery System (“BDSTM”) provides a unique range of perforating tools and equipment, which have been developed to provide a number of advantages over existing technology. The BDSTM tools facilitate perforation accuracy while addressing wellbore assurance concerns and optimizing safety, thus alleviating some of the challenges encountered when perforating. It also assists with issues incurred with high underbalanced perforating, running heavy/long assemblies, oriented perforating, depth control, reduction in fishing risk, and acquiring wellbore pressure data as guns fire. Core Lab’s BDS TM and the Addressable Fire Switch are key differentiators of Core Lab’s preassembled GoGunTM Adaptive Perforating System. The GoGunTM Adaptive Perforating System provides an open architecture design. This allows for optimal utilization of perforating energetics and, importantly, the onsite flexibility of altering completion designs for greater wellsite efficiency and improved Stimulated Reservoir Volume.
 During 2020, Core Lab introduced its next generation, best-in-class, HERO®PerFRAC energetic technology, which is now available in combination with the new, patent pending Oriented GoGun™. This new offering provides our clients with a technological solution for achieving: 1) extreme limited entry perforating capability, 2) precisely aligned perforations, and 3) minimized connections and completion string length.  Casing erosion around perforations can occur when stimulating unconventional reservoirs.  Larger perforating holes preferentially increase in size and take more frac fluid, robbing stimulation from smaller perforating holes, which results in inconsistent breakdown of the formation. The consistent-sized holes generated by the latest HERO®PerFRAC charges reduce this problem.  Core Lab partnered with major U.S. operators to design custom, consistent-hole-size charges that can be aligned in a specific orientation in order to achieve uniform breakdown across each stage. By eliminating the need for reusable orientation subassemblies, the Oriented GoGunTM minimizes the number of connections and saves time at the wellsite by not having to recapture and redress the orienting subs.  
 Core Lab’s Production Enhancement segment commissioned a cutting-edge, Reservoir Optimized Completions Lab (“ROC LabTM”) in Godley, Texas. The ROC LabTM is designed to determine the best energetic solutions for a specific rock type, to maximize productivity of an operator’s reservoir. The ROC LabTM features an industry-leading, Ultra High Pressure/High Temperature perforation test vessel. The test vessel is paired with a proprietary flow system that uses highly specialized, internally developed and manufactured pumps and flow controllers. Combined, these technologies create a proprietary flow loop capable of dynamically displacing oil, brine and gas through rock samples that have been perforated with preselected energetics. Core Lab leverages its multi-decadel expertise in conducting multi-phase fluid flow tests through porous medium to optimize this technological investment.
 Core Lab's Production Enhancement team has experienced technical services personnel to support clients through our global network of offices for the everyday use of our perforating systems and the rapid introduction of new products. Our personnel are capable of providing client training and on-site services in the completion of oil and gas wells. The patented X-SPAN® and GTX-SPAN® casing patches are supported by our technical services personnel. Market applications in Canada's steam-assisted gravity drainage environment have resulted in an upgrade in temperature ratings to as much as 600°F. These systems are capable of performing in high temperature as well as high pressure oil and gas environments and are used to seal non-productive reservoir zones from the producing wellbore.
 Marketing and Sales
 We market and sell our services and products through a combination of sales representatives, technical seminars, trade shows and print advertising. Direct sales and marketing are carried out by our sales force, technical experts and operating managers, as well as by sales representatives and distributors in various markets where we do not have offices. Our Business Development group manages a Large Account Management Program to better serve our largest and most active clients by meeting with key personnel within their organizations to ensure the quality of our services and products are meeting their expectations and addressing any issues or needs in a timely manner.
Research and Development
 The market for our services and products is characterized by changing technology and frequent product introduction. As a result, our success is dependent upon our ability to develop or acquire new services and products on a cost-effective basis and to introduce them into the marketplace in a timely manner. Many of our acquisitions have allowed us to obtain the benefits of the acquired company's research and development projects without incurring significant costs if we had attempted to develop the services and products ourselves. We incur costs as part of internal research and development, and these costs are charged to expense as incurred and reflected in the operational results of the associated business segment. We intend to continue committing financial resources and effort to the development and acquisition of new services and products. Over the years, we have made a number of technological advances, including the development of key technologies utilized in our operations. Substantially all of our new technologies are the result of requests and guidance from our clients, particularly major oil companies.

Patents and Trademarks
 We believe our patents, trademarks, technology, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are an important factor in maintaining our technological advantage, although no single one of these is considered essential to our success. Typically, we will seek to protect our intellectual property in all jurisdictions where we believe the cost of such protection is warranted. While we have patented some of our key technologies, we do not patent all of our proprietary technology even where regarded as patentable. We protect our intellectual property, including through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements, legal enforcement proceedings and by other means.
International Operations
 We operate facilities in more than 50 countries. Our non-U.S. operations accounted for 67%, 57% and 54% of our revenue from operations during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We attribute service revenue to the country in which the service was performed rather than where the reservoir or project is located, while we attribute product sales revenue to the country where the product was shipped as we feel this gives a clearer view of our operations. We do, however, have significant levels of service revenue performed and recorded in the U.S. that are sourced from projects on non-U.S. oilfields.
 The following graphs and table summarize our reported revenue by geographic region for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:

While we are subject to fluctuations and changes in currency exchange rates relating to our international operations, we attempt to limit our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by limiting the amount in which our foreign contracts are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. However, the ultimate decision as to the proportion of the foreign currency component within a contract usually resides with our clients. Consequently, we are not always able to eliminate our foreign currency exposure. We have not historically engaged in and are not currently engaged in any significant currency hedging or trading transactions designed to compensate for adverse currency fluctuations.
 Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Regulations
 We are subject to stringent governmental laws and regulations, both in the United States and other countries, pertaining to protection of the environment and occupational safety and health. Compliance with environmental legal requirements in the United States at the federal, state or local levels may require acquiring permits to conduct regulated activities, incurring capital expenditures to limit or prevent emissions, discharges and any unauthorized releases, and complying with stringent practices to handle, recycle and dispose of certain wastes.  Additionally, our operations in the United Sates are subject to stringent occupational safety and health laws and regulations, which are intended to protect worker health and safety.  Foreign countries in which we conduct operations may also have analogous controls that regulate our environmental and worker safety-related activities, which controls may impose additional, or more stringent requirements.  Consistent with our quality assurance and 
 7


control principles, we have established proactive environmental and worker safety policies in the United States and foreign countries for the management, handling, recycling or disposal of chemicals and gases and other materials and wastes resulting from our operations.  Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial or corrective obligations, the occurrence of delays or cancellations in the permitting or performance of projects and the issuance of injunctive relief in affected areas.  Historically, our environmental and worker safety compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.
 New, modified or stricter enforcement of environmental laws and regulations could be adopted or implemented that significantly increase our compliance costs, pollution mitigation costs, or the cost of any remediation of environmental contamination that may become necessary, and these costs could be material.  Our clients are also subject to most, if not all, of the same laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and occupational safety and health in the United States and in foreign countries where we operate. Consequently, to the extent these environmental compliance costs, pollution mitigation costs or remedial costs are incurred by our clients, those clients could elect to delay, restrict or cancel drilling, exploration or production programs, which could reduce demand for our products and services and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
 Our and our clients’ compliance with such existing, or any new or amended legal requirements that are placed into effect and applicable in areas where we or our clients conduct operations, could result in our or our clients’ incurring significant additional expense and operating restrictions.  Our costs may not be fully recoverable from our clients and, thus, could reduce net income. To the extent any such existing or future legal requirements result in increased costs or restrictions or cancellation in the operation of our clients, to whom we provide our services, such developments could reduce demand for our products and services and have an indirect material adverse effect on our business.
 Additionally, our analytical and manufacturing processes involve the handling and use of numerous chemicals and gases as well as the generation of wastes. Spills or other unauthorized releases of these chemicals, gases, and wastes at our facilities, whether by us or prior owners or operators, or at offsite locations where we transport them for recycling or disposal, could subject us to environmental liability, either from the applicable government agency or private landowners or other third parties. Such liabilities could be strict, joint and several, as is applicable in the United States under such laws as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. This could also include costs of cleaning up chemicals and wastes released into the environment and for damages to persons, properties or natural resources. As a result of such actions, we could be required to remove previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), remediate environmental contamination (including contaminated groundwater), and undertake measures to prevent future contamination.

 The businesses in which we engage are competitive. Some of our competitors are divisions or subsidiaries of companies that are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we have. While no one company competes with us in all of our product and service lines, we face competition in these lines, primarily from independent regional companies and internal divisions of major integrated oil and gas companies. We compete in different product and service lines to various degrees on the basis of price, technical performance, availability, quality and technical support. Our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control, including successful and timely development of new services and products, performance and quality, client service, pricing, industry trends and general economic trends.
 Reliance on the Oil and Gas Industry
 Our business and operations are substantially dependent upon the condition of the global oil and gas industry. Future downturns in the oil and gas industry, or in the oilfield services business as well as the adoption and implementation of legislation, executive orders, and other regulatory initiatives that seek to combat climate change by restricting fossil fuel activities or the locations in which such activities may be conducted, may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. This risk factor is perhaps amplified given recent pronouncements and actions taken by the executive and/or legislative branches of the U.S. government in an uncertain and shifting political environment.
 The oil and gas industry is highly cyclical and has been subject to significant economic downturns at various times as a result of numerous factors affecting the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, including the level of capital expenditures of the oil and gas industry, the level of drilling activity, the level of production activity, market prices of oil and gas, economic conditions existing in the world, interest rates and the cost of capital, environmental regulations, tax policies, political requirements of national governments, coordination by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ("OPEC"), cost of producing oil and natural gas, and technological advances.

Human Capital
 We are primarily a service provider in the oilfield services industry, so our workforce includes employees who are highly skilled professionals, including engineers and geologists, and other technical personnel, in addition to our administrative employees. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 3,700 employees. We do not have any material collective bargaining agreements and consider relations with our employees to be good.
 Core Lab values its employees and is committed to providing resources that engage employees, enhance their work experience, and develop them for the future. Our Core Values are the framework that unite us on the path toward achieving our goals and propelling Core Lab forward. These values represent and establish the foundation by which we treat each other, conduct our business and simply define “how we do things around here”. By embedding our Core Values into our operating strategies, we ensure that our company culture and mission also drive our ESG sustainability efforts. We engage our employees on our progress and core values that define us as a company. We keep our employees informed of major business developments through CoreConnect, a communication initiative to drive connection and engagement between employees and executive leadership cascaded via extended leadership teams, periodic emails, quarterly newsletters, quarterly reports, and annual events.
 To assist in this pledge, Core Lab has created its talent management strategy based on the employee life cycle. To ensure we have a diverse employee population reflective of our communities and client base, we’ve implemented recruiting practices that support and encourage the hiring and retention of diverse talent. Our total rewards approach is aligned to our business strategy and country-specific market influences. We offer competitive compensation and benefit programs in each country where we operate. Our approach not only encompasses competitive compensation and benefits, but also personal and professional growth opportunities within a global performance culture. 
 We develop our employees through performance management processes, competency-based development plans and training both in leadership and functional areas while also offering educational assistance programs. Our annual performance management cycle is an ongoing process that enables managers and employees to collaborate throughout the year to set performance goals and development objectives that align to business objectives. This process is designed to help employees understand where they add value to the organization, provide focus on and discussion around career aspirations, and reward employees for high performance.  
 We promote a culture-centric focus on the health and safety of our employees and the environment with a pro-active approach towards identifying and managing risks through recognition, evaluation, and education. We empower our employees by fostering a sense of responsibility for managing their own work environment through open communication, and a management-supported “zero accident” culture.
