ITEM 1. Business
The Company
Crocs, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively the "Company," "we," "our," or "us") are engaged in the design, development, manufacturing, worldwide marketing, distribution and sale of casual lifestyle footwear and accessories for men, women, and children. We strive to be the global leader in the sale of molded footwear featuring comfort, color, and functionality. The Company, a Delaware corporation, is the successor to a Colorado corporation of the same name, and was originally organized in 1999 as a limited liability company. Our products include footwear and accessories that utilize our proprietary closed-cell resin, called Croslite, as well as casual lifestyle footwear that use a range of materials. Our CrosliteTM material enables us to produce innovative, lightweight, non-marking, and odor-resistant footwear. We currently sell our products in more than 90 countries through domestic and international retailers and distributors, and directly to consumers through our company-operated retail stores, outlets, e-commerce store sites, and kiosks.
Since the initial introduction of our original Classic clog designs in 2002, we have expanded our product ranges to include a variety of styles and products. Going forward, we are focusing on our core molded styles, clogs, sandals, flips and slides as well as developing select casual styles. The broad appeal of our footwear has allowed us to market our products through a wide range of distribution channels, our own Crocs single-branded stores including both full price and outlet stores, our own e-commerce sites, traditional multi-branded stores including family footwear stores, sporting goods stores and a variety of specialty and independent retail channels, and third-party e-commerce sites. In select markets we also sell to distributors that are typically granted the rights to distribute our products in a given geographical area.
Products
Our product offerings have grown significantly since we first introduced the single-style clog in six colors in 2002. Recognized across the world for our iconic clog silhouette, we have taken the successful formula of a simple design aesthetic paired with modern comfort and expanded into a wide variety of casual footwear products including sandals, flips and slides, shoes, and boots that meet the needs of the whole family.
At the heart of our brand reside the Classic and Crocband clogs, our most iconic styles for adults and kids - product that embodies our innovation in molding, simplicity of design and all-day comfort. A key differentiating feature of our footwear products is our proprietary closed-cell resin Croslite material, which is uniquely suited for comfort and functionality. For further information on Croslite, see Raw Materials below.
We strive to provide our global consumer with a year-round product assortment featuring fun, comfortable, casual, colorful, and innovative styles. Our collections are designed to meet the needs of the family by focusing on key wearing occasions. Our goal is to deliver product assortments for the family with all of the comfort, features and benefits Crocs is known for.
The unique look and feel of the Classic clog can be experienced throughout our entire product line due to the use and design of Croslite. We have expanded our core molded product line, with the addition of dual density technology, warm lined styles, sandals, flips and slides, shoes and boots. We enjoy highly successful licensing partnerships with Disney, Marvel, Nickelodeon, and Warner Bros., among others, which allows us to bring popular global franchises and characters to life on our product in a fun, exciting way.
We continue to leverage our expertise and innovation in injection molding to create a fresh, distinctive point of view in the casual footwear market and to deliver a winning combination of comfort, style and versatility to our consumer year round.
Sales and Marketing
Each season we focus on presenting a compelling brand story and experience for our new product introductions as well as our on-going core products. Our marketing efforts center on story-telling across diverse wearing occasions and product silhouettes. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, total advertising costs were approximately $56.0 million, $58.2 million, and $44.7 million, respectively.
We run our business across three major geographic regions: the Americas, Asia Pacific, and Europe, which are discussed in more detail in Business Segments and Geographic Information below. In developing our market growth and expansion strategies, we prioritize five core markets including: (i) the United States, (ii) Japan, (iii) China, (iv) South Korea and (v) Germany. These countries have been identified as large-scale geographies where we believe the greatest opportunities for growth exist. We are also focusing our marketing efforts on these countries in an effort to increase customer awareness of both our brand and our full product range.

We have three primary sales channels: wholesale, which includes distributors, Crocs owned retail, and Crocs e-commerce (discussed in more detail below). Our marketing efforts are aimed at driving business to both our wholesale partners and our company-operated Crocs retail stores and e-commerce sites. Our marketing efforts in the wholesale and retail channels are focused on social and digital outreach to consumers to shop and visual merchandising. Company operated retail stores provide a unique opportunity to engage with consumers at a deeper level by showcasing our full assortment of molded and casual footwear. No single wholesale customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenues for any of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.
Wholesale Channel
During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, approximately 52.7%, 54.2% and 55.7% of revenues, respectively, were derived through the wholesale channel which consists of distributors and third-party retailers. Wholesale customers include family footwear retailers, national and regional retail chains, sporting goods stores, independent footwear retailers as well as e-tailers.
Many of our agreements allow us to accept returns from wholesale customers for defective products, on an exception basis, and to extend pricing discounts in lieu of such returns. We also may accept returns from our wholesale customers, on an exception basis, for the purpose of stock re-balancing, to ensure that our products are merchandised in the proper assortments.
Outside the United States, in addition to wholesale customers, we use third-party distributors in select markets where we believe such arrangements are preferable to direct sales. These third-party distributors purchase products pursuant to a price list and are granted the right to resell the products in a defined territory, usually a country or group of countries. Our typical distribution agreements have terms of one to five years, are generally terminable upon 30 days prior notice, and have minimum sales requirements that allow us to terminate or renegotiate the contract if minimum requirements are not met.
Retail Channel
During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, approximately 34.7%, 34.7%, and 35.5%, respectively, of our revenues were derived from sales through our retail channel. We operate our retail channel through three integrated platforms: full-price retail locations, outlet locations, kiosk and store-in-store locations. Our three types of store platforms enable us to promote the breadth of our product offering in high-traffic, highly visible locations. With the worldwide consumer shift in shopping patterns out of traditional retail to e-commerce, we are focused on carefully managing and reducing our physical retail portfolio. We intend to continue to moderate the pace of our retail expansion in 2017 with a focus on outlet locations as well as enhancing the profitability of existing locations. We opened 83 company-operated stores during the year ended December 31, 2016 and closed 84 company-operated stores. As retail store performance will vary in new and existing markets due to many factors, including maturity of the market and brand recognition, we periodically evaluate the fixed assets and leasehold improvements related to our retail locations for impairment.
Full-Price Retail Locations
Our company-operated full-price retail locations allow us to effectively showcase the full extent of our product ranges to consumers. In addition, our full-price retail locations provide us with the opportunity to interact with our consumers directly. The optimal space for our retail locations is between approximately 1,500 and 1,800 square feet, and is located in high-traffic shopping malls or districts. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we closed 66 stores and opened 19 new full-price retail stores. As of December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we operated 228, 275, and 311 full-price retail stores, respectively.
Outlet Locations
Our company-operated outlet locations allow us to sell discontinued and overstock merchandise directly to consumers at discounted prices. We also sell full-priced products in certain of our outlet stores as well as built for outlet products in certain locations. Outlet locations are similar in size to our full-price retail stores; however, they are generally located within outlet shopping centers. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we closed four outlet locations and opened 50 outlet locations. As of December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we operated 232, 186, and 174 outlet stores, respectively.
Kiosk / Store-in-Store Locations
Our company-operated kiosks and store-in-store locations allow us to market specific product lines with the further flexibility to tailor products to consumer preferences in shopping malls and other high foot traffic areas. With efficient use of retail space, and limited capital investment, we believe that kiosks and store-in-store locations can be an effective vehicle for marketing our products where this business model is applicable. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we closed 14 kiosk and store-in-store locations and opened 14 new kiosk and store-in-store locations. As of December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we operated 98, 98, and 100 kiosks and store-in-stores, respectively.

E-commerce Channel
As of December 31, 2016, we offered our products through 12 company-operated e-commerce sites worldwide. We also offer our products through third-party e-commerce sites. Revenues from third-party e-commerce sites are reported in our wholesale channel. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, approximately 12.6%, 11.1% and 8.8%, respectively, of our revenues were derived from sales through our e-commerce channel. Our e-commerce presence enables us to have increased access to our consumers and provides us with an opportunity to educate them about our products and brand. Improving our e-commerce capabilities is one of our key growth strategies. We will continue to improve our consumer's online experience, and our in stock reliability and will look for new ways to leverage digital technologies to connect with consumers, including mobile optimization of our sites.
Business Segments and Geographic Information
We have three reportable operating segments based on the geographic nature of our operations: Americas, Asia Pacific, and Europe. We also have an "Other businesses" category which aggregates insignificant operating segments that do not meet the reportable operating segment threshold, including manufacturing operations located in Mexico and Italy, and corporate operations. See additional discussion of our segments and geographic information, including results of operations and assets by segment and geography in Note 16 — Operating Segments and Geographic Information in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II — Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report.

Americas
The Americas segment consists of revenues and expenses related primarily to product sales in North and South America. Regional wholesale channel customers consist of a broad range of family footwear, sporting goods and e-tailers as well as independent retailers and distributors. The Americas retail channel sells directly to consumers through 190 company-operated retail store locations in the Americas as well as through e-commerce sites. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, revenues from the Americas segment were approximately 45.1%, 43.7%, and 40.9% of our consolidated revenues, respectively. Specifically, revenues from the United States were approximately 37.1%, 35.8%, and 36.3% of our consolidated revenues, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.
Asia Pacific
The Asia Pacific segment consists of revenues and expenses related primarily to product sales throughout Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Africa and the Middle East. The Asia Pacific wholesale channel consists of sales to a broad range of retailers similar to the wholesale channel we have established in the Americas segment, plus distributors in select markets. We also sell products directly to consumers through 270 company-operated retail stores located in Asia as well as through our e-commerce sites. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, revenues from our Asia Pacific segment were 38.1%, 39.0%, and 39.6%, of our consolidated revenues, respectively.
Europe
The Europe segment consists of revenues and expenses related primarily to product sales throughout Western Europe, Eastern Europe and Russia. The Europe segment wholesale channel customers consist of a broad range of retailers, similar to the wholesale channel we have established in the Americas segment, plus distributors in select markets. We also sell our products directly to consumers through 98 company-operated retail stores located in Europe as well as through our e-commerce sites. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, revenues from the Europe segment were 16.7 %, 17.3%, and 19.5% of our consolidated revenues, respectively.
Distribution and Logistics
On an ongoing basis, we look to enhance our distribution and logistics network to further streamline our supply chain, increase our speed to market, and lower operating costs. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we stored our raw material and finished goods inventories in company-operated warehouse and distribution facilities located in the United States, Mexico, the Netherlands, Japan, Russia, and Italy. We also utilize third-party operated distribution centers located in China, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, Korea, Singapore, India, Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates, Russia, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Puerto Rico, and Italy. As of December 31, 2016, our company-operated warehouse and distribution facilities provided us with approximately 0.9 million square feet and our third-party operated distribution facilities provided us with approximately 0.5 million square feet. We also ship a portion of our products directly to our wholesale customers from our internal and third-party manufacturers.
Raw Materials
Croslite, our branded proprietary closed-cell resin, is the primary raw material used in the majority of our footwear and some of our accessories. Croslite is soft, durable, and allows our products to be non-marking and extremely lightweight. Croslite is carefully formulated to create extremely lightweight, odor-resistant, water-resistant and non-marking footwear that conforms to the shape of the foot and increases comfort.
We continue to invest in research and development in order to refine our materials to enhance these properties and to develop new properties for specific applications. 
Croslite material is produced by compounding elastomer resins that we or one of our third-party processors purchase from major chemical manufacturers, together with certain other production inputs such as color dyes. We have identified multiple suppliers that produce the elastomer resins used in the Croslite material. We may also in the future identify and utilize materials produced by other suppliers as an alternative to, or in addition to, the elastomer resins we currently use in the production of our proprietary material. All of the other raw materials that we use to produce the Croslite products are readily available for purchase from multiple suppliers.
Since our inception in 2002, we have substantially increased the number of footwear products we offer. Many of these new products are constructed using leather, textile fabrics, or other non-Croslite materials. We, or our third-party manufacturers, obtain these materials from a number of third-party sources and we believe these materials are broadly available. We also outsource the compounding of the Croslite material and continue to purchase a portion of our compounded raw materials from a third-party in Europe.

Research, Design and Development
We continue to dedicate significant resources to product design and development as we expand the footwear styles we offer based on opportunities we identify in the marketplace. Our design and development process is highly collaborative and we continually strive to improve our development function so we can bring products to market quickly and at reduced costs, while maintaining product quality. We spent $11.9 million, $14.0 million, and $16.7 million in research, design, and development activities for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
Manufacturing and Sourcing
Our strategy is to maintain a flexible, globally diversified, low-cost manufacturing base. We currently have company-operated production facilities in Mexico and Italy. We also contract with third-party manufacturers to produce certain of our footwear styles or to provide support to our internal production processes.
In the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we manufactured approximately 14.6%, 11.3%, and 13.9%, respectively, of our footwear products internally. We sourced the remaining footwear production from multiple third-party manufacturers primarily in China, Vietnam, Eastern Europe and South America. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, our largest third-party manufacturer in China produced approximately 23.4%, 26.6%, and 27.5%, respectively, of our third-party footwear unit volume. We do not have written supply agreements with our primary third-party manufacturers in Asia.
Intellectual Property and Trademarks
We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, trade dress and patent protections to establish, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights in our product designs, brands, materials, and research and development efforts, although no such methods can afford complete protection. We own or license the material trademarks used in connection with the marketing, distribution, and sale of all of our products, both domestically and internationally, in most countries where our products are currently either sold or manufactured. Our major trademarks include the Crocs logo and the Crocs word mark, both of which are registered or pending registration in the U.S., the European Union, Japan, Taiwan, China, and Canada among other countries. We also have registrations or pending trademark applications for other marks and logos in various countries around the world.
In the U.S., our patents are generally in effect for up to 20 years from the date of filing the patent application. Our trademarks registered within and outside of the U.S. are generally valid as long as they are in use and their registrations are properly maintained and have not been found to become generic. We believe our trademarks and copyrights are crucial to the successful marketing and sale of our products. We will continue to strategically register, both domestically and internationally, the trademarks and copyrights we utilize today and those we develop in the future. We also intend to continue to aggressively police our patents, trademarks and copyrights and pursue those who infringe upon them, both domestically and internationally, as we deem necessary.
We consider the formulations of the materials covered by our trademark Croslite and used to produce our shoes to be a valuable trade secret. Croslite material is manufactured through a process that combines a number of components in various proportions to achieve the properties for which our products are known. We use multiple suppliers to source these components but protect the formula by using exclusive supply agreements for key components, confidentiality agreements with our third-party processors, and by requiring our employees to execute confidentiality agreements concerning the protection of our confidential information. Other than our third-party processors, we are unaware of any third party using our formula in the production of shoes. We believe the comfort and utility of our products depend on the properties achieved from the compounding of Croslite material and constitute a key competitive advantage for us, and we intend to continue to vigorously protect this trade secret.
We also actively combat counterfeiting through monitoring of the global marketplace. We use our employees, sales representatives, distributors, and retailers, as well as outside investigators and attorneys, to police against infringing products by encouraging them to notify us of any suspect products and to assist law enforcement agencies. Our sales representatives and distributors are also educated on our patents, pending patents, trademarks and trade dress to assist in preventing potentially infringing products from obtaining retail shelf space. The laws of certain countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent or in the same manner as do the laws of the U.S., and, therefore, we may have difficulty obtaining legal protection for our intellectual property in certain foreign jurisdictions.
Seasonality
Due to the seasonal nature of our footwear, which is more heavily focused on styles suitable for warm weather, revenues generated during our fourth quarter are typically less than revenues generated during our first three quarters, when the northern hemisphere is experiencing warmer weather. We continue to expand our product line to include more winter oriented styles to reduce the seasonality of our revenues. Our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including the timing of new model introductions, or general economic conditions, or consumer confidence. Accordingly, 
6

results of operations and cash flows for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of expected results for any other quarter or for any other year.
Backlog
We receive a significant portion of orders from our wholesale customers and distributors that remain unfilled as of any date and, at that point, represent orders scheduled to be shipped at a future date. We refer to these unfilled orders as backlog, which can be canceled by our customers at any time prior to shipment. Backlog only relates to wholesale and distributor orders for the next season and current season fill-in orders, and excludes potential sales in our retail and e-commerce channels. Backlog as of a particular date is affected by a number of factors, including seasonality, manufacturing schedules and the timing of product shipments. Backlog also is affected by the timing of customers' orders and product availability. Due to these factors and business model differences around the globe, we believe backlog is an imprecise indicator of future revenues that may be achieved in a fiscal period and cannot be relied upon.
Competition
The global casual, athletic and fashion footwear markets are highly competitive. Although we believe that we do not compete directly with any single company with respect to the entire spectrum of our products, we believe portions of our wholesale, retail, and e-commerce businesses compete with companies including, but not limited to, Nike Inc., adidas AG, Under Armour, Inc., Deckers Outdoor Corporation, Skechers USA, Inc., Steve Madden, Ltd., Wolverine World Wide, Inc. and VF Corporation. Our company-operated retail locations also compete with footwear retailers such as Genesco, Inc., Macy's Inc., Dillard's, Inc., Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc., The Finish Line Inc., and Foot Locker, Inc.
The principal elements of competition in these markets include brand awareness, product functionality, design, comfort, quality, pricing, customer service, and marketing and distribution. We believe that our unique footwear designs, our Croslite material, our prices, our expanded product line, and our distribution network continue to position us well in the marketplace. However, a number of companies in the casual footwear industry have greater financial resources, more comprehensive product lines, broader market presence, longer standing relationships with wholesalers, longer operating histories, greater distribution capabilities, stronger brand recognition and greater marketing resources than we have. Furthermore, we face competition from new companies who have been attracted to the market with products similar to ours as the result of the unique design and success of our footwear products.
Foreign Currency Fluctuations on Revenues and Net Income (Loss)
As a global company, we have significant revenues and costs denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. We are exposed to the risk of gains and losses resulting from changes in exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities within our international subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than the subsidiary’s functional currency. Likewise, our U.S. companies are also exposed to the risk of gains and losses resulting from changes in exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar.
We have experienced, and will continue to experience, changes in international currency rates, impacting both results of operations and the value of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. We enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to buy or sell various foreign currencies to selectively protect against volatility in the value of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these forward contracts are recognized in earnings.
Changes in exchange rates have a direct effect on our reported U.S. Dollar consolidated financial statements because we translate the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries to U.S. Dollars using current period exchange rates. Specifically, we translate the statements of operations of our foreign subsidiaries into the U.S. Dollar reporting currency using average exchange rates each reporting period. As a result, comparisons of reported results between reporting periods may be impacted significantly by differences in the exchange rates used to translate the operating results of our international subsidiaries.
For example, in our European segment, when the U.S. Dollar strengthens relative to the Euro, our reported U.S. Dollar results are less than if there had been no change in the exchange rate, because more Euros are required to generate the same U.S. Dollar translated amount. Conversely, when the U.S. Dollar weakens relative to the Euro, the reported U.S. Dollar results of our Europe segment are higher compared to a period with a stronger U.S. Dollar relative to the Euro. Similarly, the reported U.S. Dollar results of our Asia Pacific segment, where the functional currencies are primarily the Japanese Yen, Chinese Yuan, Korean Won and the Singapore Dollar, are comparatively lower or higher when the U.S. Dollar strengthens or weakens, respectively, relative to these currencies. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the impact of the change in foreign exchange rates on our U.S. Dollar consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
