Item 1. Business
Unless expressly indicated or the context requires otherwise, the terms “Elevate,” “company,” “we,” “us” and “our” used below refer to Elevate Credit, Inc. and, where appropriate, our wholly owned subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities, as well as the direct lending and branded product business of our predecessor, Think Finance, Inc. ("TFI"), for periods prior to our 2014 spin-off from TFI. We generally refer to loans, customers and other information and data associated with each of Rise, Elastic and Today Card as Elevate’s loans, customers, information and data, irrespective of whether Elevate originates the credit to the customer or whether such credit is originated by a third party, or originated loans by FinWise Bank, Republic Bank and Capital Community Bank, where Elevate serves as a service provider. Effective June 29, 2020, we exited the United Kingdom (“UK”) and no longer offered installment loans under our “Sunny” brand name.
OUR COMPANY
This past year was one of the most challenging years ever, especially for non-prime consumers—approximately 132 million people in the US, typically defined as those with credit scores of less than 680. The volatility in monthly income sources for this large segment of America, what we now refer to as the New Middle Class, was even more pronounced with the shutdowns of vast portions of certain industries brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. This has always been a difficult market to underwrite and serve with traditional credit approaches. We’re succeeding at it—and doing it responsibly—with best-in-class advanced technology and proprietary risk analytics honed by serving more than 2.5 million customers with $8.8 billion in credit that have not been well served by traditional bank products and want better options than payday loans, title loans, pawn and storefront installment loans. Our current online credit brands, Rise (installment loan), Elastic (line of credit) and Today Card (credit card), reflect our mission to provide consumers with access to competitively priced credit and services while helping them build a brighter financial future with credit building and financial wellness features. These credit solutions help provide non-prime Americans with lower priced, safe, convenient and flexible financial solutions. 
We call this mission "Good Today, Better Tomorrow."
In 2020, we had net income from continuing operations of $36.2 million and record adjusted earnings of $54.7 million, with a return on average equity (ROE) from continuing operations of 22.4% (refer to "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures—Adjusted Earnings" below for our adjusted earnings calculation). COVID-19 had a negative impact on customer loan demand and resulting revenue, as government stimulus payments received by our brand customers were either used to pay down loans or to supplement their monthly income. This resulted in historically low loan losses, combined with lower direct marketing and operating costs, leading to higher operating income from continuing operations despite the drop in revenue. However, we’re most proud that we were able to serve non-prime Americans better than ever through the pandemic while also delivering exceptional shareholder returns. 
We, along with the banks we support, have steadily reduced the effective APR of our products for our non-prime consumers, with overall pricing on the entire loan portfolio now down 59% from 2013. We estimate that, since 2013, our products have saved our customers more than $7.9 billion over what they would have paid for payday loans, based on a comparison of revenues from our combined loan portfolio and the same portfolio with an APR of 400%, which is the approximate average APR for a payday loan according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"). As of December 31, 2020, more than 65% of Rise customers in good standing have received a rate reduction on their installment loan. Additionally, in 2020 we, along with the banks we support, offered payment assistance tools to more than 80,000 of our customers, helping them navigate through the pandemic. We believe all this differentiates our products in the market. Moreover, we believe doing business this way is the right thing to do.
We differentiate ourselves in the following ways:
Ø    Online and mobile products that are “Good Today, Better Tomorrow.”    Our products, and those originated by banks that rely on our marketing expertise and license our technology services, are “Good Today” because they help solve our customers’ immediate financial needs with competitively priced credit and a simple online application process that provides credit decisions in seconds and funds as soon as the next business day. We are committed to transparent pricing with no prepayment penalties or punitive fees as well as amortizing loan balances and flexible repayment schedules that let customers design the loan repayment terms that they can afford (Rise and Elastic products). Our five-day risk-free guarantee provides confidence to customers that if they can find a better financial solution within that time span, they simply repay the principal with no other fees. In addition, our products are “Better Tomorrow” because they reward successful payment history with rates on subsequent loans that can decrease over time (Rise installment loans) and can help customers improve their long-term financial well-being with features like credit bureau reporting, free credit monitoring, and online financial literacy videos and tools.
Ø    Industry-leading technology and proprietary risk analytics optimized for the non-prime credit market.    We have made substantial investments in our proven technology and analytics platforms to support rapid scaling and innovation, robust regulatory compliance, and ongoing improvements in underwriting. Our proven technology platform provides for nimble testing and optimization of our user interface and underwriting strategies, highly automated loan originations, cost-effective servicing, and robust compliance oversight. Our proprietary risk analytics infrastructure utilizes a massive (approximately 80+ terabyte) Hadoop database composed of more than ten thousand potential data variables related to each of the customers we have served. We are in the process of migrating our data stack to Snowflake, a next generation cloud-based platform, which will provide us with improved scalability, reliability and performance benefits to support our future growth. Our team of data scientists uses our proprietary technology to build and test scores and strategies across the entire underwriting process, including segmented credit scores, fraud scores, affordability scores and former customer scores. We also use a variety of analytical techniques from traditional multivariate regression to machine learning and artificial intelligence to continue to enhance our underwriting accuracy while complying with applicable lending laws and regulations. As a result of our proprietary technology and risk analytics, more than 95% of loan applications are automatically decisioned in seconds with no manual review required.
Ø    Integrated multi-channel marketing strategy.    We use a multi-channel marketing strategy to directly reach potential customers through our paid, earned and owned channels. Our marketing strategy includes coordinated direct mail programs, strategic partnerships and digital marketing. Our direct-to-consumer approach allows us to focus on higher quality, lower cost customer acquisitions and to control overall marketing costs. Our customer acquisition costs (“CAC”) have remained within the range of $200 to $300 over the past five years. We invest in improved customer targeting analytics and increasingly sophisticated response models to allow us to expand our marketing reach while maintaining target CAC. We continue to invest in new marketing capabilities that we believe will provide us with competitive advantages and support ongoing growth. 
Ø    Payment assistance tools.    We integrate payment assistance tools into all three products currently in market. These tools include payment grace periods, payment deferments, interest rate reductions, and/or principal and interest forgiveness. We developed these best-in-class features to assist non-prime consumers as they face unexpected financial hardships, such as a loss of income. We know from our experience that non-prime consumers will often experience financial challenges throughout the course of a loan – adding this layer of assistance at no additional costs helps the customer through a period of financial difficulty resulting in a positive outcome for both the customer and for us. During the pandemic, these tools became a lifeline for some 80,000 customers. Many of these tools are available self-service to customers through our platform. We continue to invest in payment assistance tools and anticipate they will continue to result in successful outcomes for the customer and for us beyond the pandemic. 
OUR PRODUCTS
Our innovative online credit solutions provide immediate relief to customers today and can help them build a brighter financial future. Rise and Elastic are available through online and mobile devices. The Today Card is a credit card product, and its user interfaces all happen online or through a mobile device as well. These products reflect the deep experience of our management team in the online non-prime lending industry and utilize leading technology and proprietary risk analytics to effectively manage profitability and optimize the customer experience.
Each of these products reflects our “Good Today, Better Tomorrow” mission and offers competitive rates and responsible lending features along with credit building and financial wellness tools. Our products have rates on subsequent loans that can decrease over time (Rise installment loans), no punitive fees (Rise and Elastic products), an industry-leading five day "Risk Free Guarantee," credit bureau reporting, free credit monitoring, and online financial literacy videos and tools. The five day "Risk Free Guarantee" allows the borrower five business days to change their mind about the loan and return the principal with no fees. In addition, to help our customers facing financial hardships, we have eliminated punitive fees, including returned payment fees and late charges, among others, on all products excluding our Today Card credit card, which does include some modest industry-standard fees. Our products offer rates that we believe are typically more than 50% lower than many generally available alternatives from legacy non-prime lenders, and since 2013 have saved our customers more than $7.9 billion over what they would have paid for payday loans. 
We provide convenient, easy-to-use products via online and mobile platforms. Consumers are able to apply using a mobile-optimized online application, which takes only minutes to complete from a mobile or desktop device. Credit determinations are typically made in seconds and more than 95% of loan application decisions are fully automated with no manual review required. Funds are typically available the next-day. Consumers can elect to make payments via preapproved automated clearinghouse (“ACH”) authorization or other methods such as check or debit card transfer.
Our customers can select a payment schedule that fits their needs with no prepayment penalties. We do not offer any “single payment” or “balloon-payment” credit products that can lead to a cycle of debt and have been criticized by many consumer groups as well as the CFPB. To ensure that consumers fully understand the product and their alternatives, we provide extensive “Know Before You Borrow” disclosures. Consistent with our goal of being sensitive to the unique needs of non-prime consumers, we also offer flexible solutions to help customers facing issues impacting their ability to make scheduled payments. Our solutions include notifications before payment processing, extended due dates, grace periods, payment plans and special payment programs.
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, all of our brands offered flexibility in payment schedules and deferrals. In 2020, we rolled out additional self-serve features that allowed more than 80,000 customers to modify their payment plans at no incremental costs. We expect these programs to continue into the future as these programs enhance consumer repayment likelihood and consumer flexibility.
This combination of features has resulted in extremely high customer satisfaction for our products. Our customer satisfaction ratings were generally over 90% for our products during 2020.
Rise, Elastic, and Today Card each follow distinct regulatory models, providing diversification across different regulatory frameworks. The Rise brand operates under licenses from each state it serves and is regulated by the CFPB; it also operates as a bank-originated credit product that is regulated by the FDIC. Elastic and the Today Card brands are both bank-originated and are regulated by the FDIC and other bank regulators.
Rise—installment loans
The structure of the Rise brand varies as a result of differing state laws and federal law governing the portfolio. We utilize risk-based pricing across the portfolio to optimally serve a large percentage of non-prime customers with rates ranging from 36% to 299%. There are no origination fees, monthly fees, late fees, over-limit fees, or fees for returned payments on the product. Eligible customers may receive a rate reduction on their next loan if certain eligibility criteria are met. As of December 31, 2020, more than 65% of Rise installment customers in good standing had received a rate reduction mid-loan or after a refinance or on a subsequent loan. Retention is also strong, with approximately 70% of Rise installment customers in good standing having refinanced or taken out a subsequent loan as of December 31, 2020. We believe the Rise effective APR of 110% for the year ended December 31, 2020, is nearly 75% lower than the average effective rate of a typical payday loan, based on the CFPB’s findings that the average APR for a payday loan is approximately 400%. 
FinWise Bank and Capital Community Bank also license the Rise brand and originate installment loans in certain states not otherwise covered by the Elevate-originated Rise brand. As the originator of the Rise loans in those states, the banks review and approve all marketing materials and campaigns and determine the underwriting strategies and score cutoffs used in processing applications. In addition, FinWise Bank and Capital Community Bank define all program parameters and provide full compliance oversight over all aspects of the programs. Under the terms of our agreement with the banks, we provide the marketing services related to the Rise brand and license our technology platform and proprietary credit and fraud scoring models in order to help them originate and service the Rise customers. Our platform supports the banks' operational and compliance activities related to the Rise program. See “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Overview” regarding the structure of EF SPV, Ltd. and EC SPV, Ltd. and how we recognize revenue associated with Rise loans originated by FinWise Bank and Capital Community Bank.
Elastic—bank-originated lines of credit
Elastic is an online line of credit designed to be a financial safety net for non-prime consumers, originated by a third-party lender, Republic Bank. We believe that Elastic's effective APR of 94% for the year ended December 31, 2020 is more than 75% lower than the average effective rate of a typical payday loan, based on the above-mentioned findings by the CFPB. There are no origination fees, monthly fees, late fees, over-limit fees or fees for returned payments on the product. Additionally, consumers must make a 10% mandatory principal reduction each month designed to encourage the full repayment of the original loan amount in approximately 10 months or less.
Under the terms of our agreement with Republic Bank, we provide them with marketing services related to the Elastic program and license them our technology platform and proprietary credit and fraud scoring models to originate and service Elastic customers. However, as the originator of the Elastic lines of credit, Republic Bank reviews and approves all marketing materials and campaigns and determines the underwriting strategies and score cutoffs used in processing applications. In addition, Republic Bank defines all program parameters and provides full compliance oversight over all aspects of the program. Our platform supports Republic Bank’s operational and compliance activities related to the Elastic program. See “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Overview” regarding the structure of ESPV and how we recognize revenue associated with Elastic loans.
Today Card—credit card
Today Card is a credit card product designed to meet the spending needs of non-prime consumers by offering a prime customer experience. Today Card is originated by Capital Community Bank of Utah under the licensed Mastercard brand.
As our lowest APR product (29.99-34.99%), Today Card allows us to serve a broader spectrum of non-prime Americans. During 2020, Today Card experienced significant growth, with 237% year-over-year growth in the number of active customers. We followed a specific limited growth plan in 2020 to continue testing customer response rates and credit quality. Based on our initial rollout, customer response to the Today Card has been very strong, and we continue to see extremely high response rates, high customer engagement, and positive customer satisfaction scores. We will look to continue to scale this product in 2021.
Sunny—UK installment loans
We ceased offering installment loans in the UK under our “Sunny” brand effective June 29, 2020 due to a continued lack of clarity within the UK regulatory environment coupled with the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. See “Regulatory Environment” for additional information related to our exit from the UK market.
INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
Non-prime consumers represent the largest segment of the US credit market
We provide credit to non-prime consumers, many of whom face reduced credit options and increased financial pressure due to macro-economic changes over the past few decades. We believe that this segment of the population represents a massive and underserved market of approximately 132 million consumers in the US:
Ø    According to an analysis of FICO credit score data as of 2018, more than 33% of the US population had non-prime credit scores of less than 680.
Ø    In 2020, a CFPB report indicated that one in ten US adults, or approximately 26 million individuals, lack a credit record and are "credit invisible." Another 19 million Americans have a credit record but no score due to either a lack of sufficient history or current data.
Typical customers are middle-income and have a mainstream demographic profile as illustrated below, according to a 2019 and 2020 Elevate analysis of income and homeownership of customers, including self-reported customer information. This is in line with the average of the population of the US in terms of income, educational background and rate of homeownership. We refer to them as the “New Middle Class.”
 
 | Rise and Elastic Customer Profile 
Average income | $44,532 for Rise ($38,038 Median) $53,018 for Elastic ($45,942 Median)
% Attended college | 82% 
% Own their homes (2019 survey) | 17% 
Typical range of FICO score(1) | 577-608 

 (1) Range of middle quintile of Elevate US customers - 2020 Elevate data.
We have also established a research organization focused on non-prime consumers called the “Center for the New Middle Class” to raise the awareness of their unique needs. As a result, we believe we are leading a new breed of more responsible online credit providers for the New Middle Class.
Our customers have varying credit profiles and are more likely to be turned down for credit by many traditional bank lenders. They are risky and can be difficult to underwrite—often due to factors outside of their control. To provide insight into the different types of credit histories and financial needs facing our non-prime customers and the challenges of serving them, the following categories are illustrative:
Ø    “Prime-ish.”    Consumers with significant credit history and access to traditional credit sources who are now looking for non-bank credit. They may be over-extended on their existing credit sources and their creditworthiness may be eroding.
Ø    “Challenged.”    Consumers who have had traditional credit in the past but experienced defaults or had a history of late payments and as a result may now use alternative non-prime products such as payday, pawn and title loans.
Ø    “Invisibles.”    Consumers with no credit history or such minimal credit experience that they cannot be sufficiently scored by traditional means and as a result are often kept outside the traditional credit markets. These consumers often have limited or no credit profile and may have a high chance of potential fraud.
These categories do not correspond to specific credit score bands or precise scores or definitions for the customers included in such categories. We continue to identify additional customer categories and evolve our customer category definitions over time.
The New Middle Class has an unmet need for credit
Due to wage stagnation over the past several decades and the continued impact of the previous financial crisis, the New Middle Class is characterized by a lack of savings and significant income volatility. According to a Federal Reserve survey in 2019, 37% of American adults said they could not cover an emergency expense of $400 or would cover it by selling an asset or borrowing money. Further, the JPMorgan Chase Institute reported in a 2015 study of 100,000 US customers that 41% saw their incomes vary by more than 30% from month-to-month and noted that the bottom 80% of households by income lacked sufficient savings to cover the volatility observed in income and spending. Compounding these financial realities is the fact that average household income has generally remained flat for over a decade. As a result, our customer base often must rely on credit to fund unexpected expenses, like car and home repairs or medical emergencies.
Non-prime consumers have different needs for credit
Non-prime consumers generally have unique and immediate credit needs, which differ greatly from the typical prime consumer. Whereas prime consumers consider price most often in selecting their credit products, we believe that non-prime consumers will often consider a variety of features, including the simplicity of the application process, speed of decisioning and funding, how they will be treated if they cannot pay their loan back on time, and flexible repayment terms.
Banks do not adequately serve the New Middle Class
Most banks have tightened their underwriting standards and increased their minimum FICO score requirements for borrowers, leaving non-prime borrowers with severely reduced access to traditional credit. Despite the improving economy before the pandemic, banks continue to underserve the New Middle Class. According to our analysis of master pool trust data of securitizations for the five major credit card issuers, we estimate that from 2008 to 2016 revolving credit available to US borrowers with a FICO score of less than a 660 was reduced by approximately $142 billion. This reduction has had a profound impact on non-prime consumers who typically have little to no savings. Often, the only credit-like product offered by banks that is available to non-prime borrowers is overdraft protection, which in essence provides credit at extremely high rates. A 2017 report by the CFPB estimates that consumer overdraft and non-sufficient funds fees revenues total as much as $17 billion annually.
Legacy non-prime lenders are not innovative
As a result of limited access to credit products offered by banks, the New Middle Class has historically had to rely on a variety of legacy non-prime lenders, such as storefront installment lenders, payday lenders, title lenders, pawn and rent-to-own providers that typically do not offer customers the convenience of online and mobile access. While legacy non-prime credit products may fulfill a borrower’s immediate funding needs, many of these products have significant drawbacks for consumers, including a potential cycle of debt, higher interest rates, punitive fees and aggressive collection tactics. Additionally, legacy non-prime lenders do not typically report to major credit bureaus, so non-prime consumers often remain in a cycle of non-prime and rarely improve their financial options.
Fintech startups have largely ignored the non-prime credit market 
Where new online marketplace lenders and small business lenders have emerged to serve prime consumers, few innovative solutions tailored for non-prime consumers have come to market and achieved any meaningful scale. We believe this is because underwriting non-prime consumers presents significantly greater analytical challenges than underwriting prime consumers. Unlike prime consumers, the credit profiles of non-prime consumers vary greatly and may contain significant derogatory credit information, yet non-prime consumers often need instant decisions with a minimum of paperwork and inconvenience. While new data and techniques can assist in improving underwriting capabilities, we believe lenders still require deep insight and extensive experience to successfully serve non-prime consumers while maintaining target loss rates. Additionally, we believe the compliance and other systems necessary to serve non-prime consumers in a manner consistent with regulatory requirements can be a barrier to entry. We believe we have a significant lead over new entrants with our competitive advantages, experience and technology. Additionally, we have seen the competitive landscape shift as larger competitors have shifted and diversified their operating models into other areas such as small business loans or into smaller international markets.
Consumers are embracing the internet for their personal finances
One of the anticipated long-term impacts from the pandemic will be the heightened shift to e-commerce. Across all industries, consumers have indicated their desire for convenient online interactions. We believe the pandemic accelerated this trend as retail storefronts across the nation were inaccessible. Financial products will be no exception, and we anticipate consumers of brick-and-mortar lenders to continue to shift to online offerings such as ours. 
OUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES
Using our proven technology platform and proprietary risk analytics infrastructure, we are able to offer our customers innovative credit solutions that place us as a leader among a new breed of more responsible, online non-prime lenders. We believe the following are our key competitive advantages:
Ø    Differentiated online and mobile products for non-prime consumers.    Our product development is driven by a deep commitment to solving customers’ immediate financial need for credit and helping them improve their long-term financial future with our products' convenience, cost, transparency and flexibility. Our average customer receives an interest rate that we believe is more than 50% less than that offered by many legacy non-prime lenders. Furthermore, the convenience of online and mobile access and flexible repayment options distinguish our products from many legacy non-prime credit options. However, we go even further in creating credit products that can help enable customers to have a “better tomorrow" with rates that can decrease over time (Rise installment loans) and presenting a path to prime credit for struggling consumers with credit bureaus reporting, free credit monitoring, and online financial literacy videos and tools to help build better financial management skills. 
Ø    Industry-leading risk analytics infrastructure and underwriting scores.    Traditional approaches for underwriting credit such as FICO scores are not adequate for non-prime consumers who may have significant derogatory credit history or no credit history at all. Because continued leadership in non-prime underwriting is essential to drive growth, support continued rate reductions to customers, and manage losses, we built our proprietary risk analytics infrastructure to support the development and enhancement of our underwriting scores and strategies. As discussed above, our risk analytics infrastructure utilizes a massive (approximately 80+ terabyte) Hadoop database composed of greater than ten thousand potential data variables related to each of the 2.5 million customers we have served. This data is composed of variables from consumer applications and website behavior, credit bureaus, bank account transaction data, numerous other alternative third-party data providers as well as performance history for funded customers. Furthermore, our proprietary credit and fraud scoring models allow not only for the scoring of a broad range of non-prime consumers, but also across a variety of products, channels, geographies and regulatory requirements.
Ø    Innovative and flexible proven technology platform.    Investment in our flexible and scalable technology platform has enabled us to rapidly grow and innovate new products. Our proven technology platform provides for nimble testing and optimization of our user interface and underwriting strategies, highly automated loan originations, cost-effective servicing, and robust compliance oversight. In addition, our platform is adaptable to allow us to enhance current products or launch future online products to meet evolving consumer preferences and respond to a dynamic regulatory environment. Further, our open architecture allows us to easily integrate with best-in-class third-party providers, including strategic partners, data sources and outsourced vendors.
Ø    Seasoned management team with strong industry track record.    We have a seasoned team of senior executives with an average of over 15 years of experience in online technology and financial services. This team is led by Jason Harvison, a financial services industry veteran with over two decades of experience. Furthermore, under their management, Elevate was certified as a “Great Place To Work” in 2020 for the fifth consecutive year, with 92% of employees affirming that they believe Elevate is a great place to work. This is a testament to our strong customer-focused workplace culture, which has continued to thrive despite unprecedented challenges in 2020.
OUR STRATEGY
To achieve our goal of being the most trusted provider of financial services to the New Middle Class, we intend to execute the following strategies:
Ø    Continue to grow our brands.    Rise and Elastic were launched in 2013, and the Today Card was launched in 2018. Given strong consumer demand and organic growth potential, we believe that significant opportunities exist to expand these three brands within their current markets via existing marketing channels. As non-prime consumers become increasingly familiar and comfortable with online and mobile financial services, we also plan to capture the new business generated as they migrate away from less convenient legacy brick-and-mortar lenders. 
Ø    Widen the credit spectrum of borrowers served with new products.    We continue to evaluate new product and market opportunities that fit into our overall strategic objective of delivering next-generation online and mobile credit products that span the non-prime credit spectrum. Our newest product, the Today Card offers much lower rates than our other products and is a credit card and that has helped us expand our market. In addition, we are continually focused on improving our analytics to effectively underwrite and serve consumers within those segments of the non-prime credit spectrum that we do not currently reach.
Ø    Pursue additional strategic partnerships and digital marketing channels.    Our progressive non-prime credit solutions have attracted top-tier affiliate partners including Credit Karma and Lending Tree as a way to serve customers they have acquired. We intend to continue growing our existing affiliate partnerships and will evaluate opportunities to enter into new partnerships. We expect these partnerships to provide us with access to a broad range of potential new customers with low customer acquisition costs. In addition, we continue to expand our digital marketing efforts across our products. In 2021, we look to grow these channels by further optimizing our multi-channel marketing mix.
Ø    Expand our relationship with existing customers.    Customer acquisition costs represent one of the most significant expenses for online lenders. We will seek to expand our strong relationships with existing customers by providing qualified customers with new loans on improved terms or offering other products and services. We believe we can better serve our customers with improved products and services while, at the same time, achieving better operating leverage.
Ø    Enter new markets.    We will explore pursuing strategic opportunities to expand into additional domestic markets. However, we plan to take a disciplined approach to expansion, utilizing customized products and in-market expertise. We currently do not expect to undertake any international expansion in the near term. 
ADVANCED ANALYTICS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The non-prime lending challenge
Traditional underwriting requires manual review of physical documents and human credit decisions. This is inconvenient for customers and for lenders it is resource-intensive, time-consuming and can lead to inconsistent results. "Fintech" lenders have recently used Big Data techniques to revolutionize the offering of credit. Instant credit decisions and automated processes are increasingly the norm for innovative online lenders.
In non-prime consumer lending, however, the analytical challenges are significantly greater. Traditional credit scores like FICO are poorly correlated with risk for non-prime consumers. Whereas prime consumers have established positive credit histories with traditional credit products and very little derogatory credit information, non-prime consumers are more varied and difficult to underwrite since they may have significant derogatory credit history or no credit history at all. Because of the wider variety of credit backgrounds and higher credit risk, automated analytical techniques for underwriting non-prime consumers must be much more sophisticated.
We use our deep insights into non-prime consumers and extensive experience to develop differentiated analytical techniques and scores to better underwrite and price credit for the New Middle Class. This approach provides for extremely high levels of automation in the underwriting process and has been proven to be effective, resulting in improving credit performance since launching the current generation of products in 2013.
(1) The 2019 and 2020 vintages are not yet fully mature from a loss perspective.
(2) UK included in the 2013 to 2017 vintages only.
(3) Does not include Today Card data as it is not material since its launch in 2018.
Furthermore, we invest significant resources into the research and development of new data sources and new analytical techniques to continue to improve our capabilities.
Proprietary risk analytics infrastructure
Unlike prime lenders who can use off-the-shelf credit scores such as FICO or build custom scores with limited data fields, we believe that successfully underwriting non-prime consumers in an online environment requires access to a much wider variety of data including not only traditional credit attributes and application information, but also website behavior, internal information, bank account information, social media information, email and phone number information, among others. Because continued leadership in non-prime underwriting is essential to drive growth, support further rate reductions to customers, and manage losses, we have made substantial investments in our risk analytics infrastructure and in the development of the latest generation of our underwriting scores and strategies. We believe this Big Data approach and investment is foundational to our ongoing initiatives to improve underwriting and lower rates to our customers. 
Segmentation strategies across the entire underwriting process
Based on our extensive experience and track record in the industry, we have found that FICO and other monolithic credit scores are inadequate for the non-prime market. Instead, we have used our exclusive risk analytics infrastructure to develop an array of proprietary scores and strategies using highly predictive data sources and advanced analytical techniques targeting unique customer segments and marketing channels as well as different fraud types. This analytical approach, while more complex than most prime underwriting approaches, allows us to serve an expanding set of non-prime consumer segments and marketing channels while improving credit quality at acceptable customer acquisition costs. We use this approach across the entire underwriting process for both new and former customers, as described in the following chart:
Segment specific credit scores
Based on our segmentation model, we utilize highly predictive data (including nationwide credit reporting agencies (“NCRA”), non-prime bureau data, and wide-ranging alternative data sources, as well as internally collected proprietary customer credit performance history) and analytical techniques (including multivariate regression, machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques) to achieve a high level of accuracy building targeted credit scores for key customer segments and channels. For instance, for “prime-ish” consumers who have access to traditional credit sources but supplement them with non-prime credit, we use NCRA data extensively in our proprietary credit and fraud scoring models. For “challenged” consumers who have derogatory NCRA credit information and, as a result, non-prime credit data is more relevant, our proprietary credit and fraud scoring models leverage data provided by non-prime credit bureau sources like Experian's Clarity and Teletrack. For “credit invisibles” with limited or no credit history, we may utilize a host of alternative data sources, such as detailed bank account data as well as the duration for which an applicant has used the same mobile phone number or used an email address. Our definitions of our customer segments and the ways they affect our credit scoring models evolve over time. 
Targeted fraud scores
In addition to our segment-specific credit scores, we have developed targeted fraud scores for different types of fraud. For instance, we have found that first-party fraud (when the loan applicant provides correct identity information but has no intent of repaying the loan), third-party fraud (when the applicant has stolen someone else’s identity information) and bank account fraud (when the borrower intends to shut down his or her account shortly after receiving the proceeds from the loan) are fundamentally different and require unique analysis and risk management tools.
Examples of data sources that we have found to be predictive in our fraud scores include IP address information, how applicants use our website (including pages viewed), and email and bank account information as well as identity information provided by third parties.
Affordability analysis and line offers
Although not currently required by US federal law, we proactively assess the affordability of our products for our customers. We use multiple approaches including debt to income, payment to income and full budgeting based on third-party and self-reported information and continue to evaluate the effectiveness of each approach. Where applicable, we integrate real-time bank account information into our affordability scores. Our affordability assessment impacts both the decision of whether to provide the loan, as well as the maximum amount to offer. We use an enhanced affordability analysis that integrates previous payment history to underwrite current customers seeking to refinance their loan and for former customers requesting additional credit.
Customer management
In addition to underwriting new customers, we have built scores and strategies for underwriting customers who have paid off their initial loan and are looking for a new loan, or for customers who may want to refinance their current loan, typically for a larger amount and a lower rate. These scores and strategies reassess the customer’s creditworthiness integrating their payment history on previous loans. Based on this information and revised affordability analysis, the customer is either offered a new maximum loan amount and APR or declined for additional credit.
Fully automated, near-instant credit decisions
Credit and fraud determinations are made in seconds and over 95% of loan applications for all products are fully automated with no manual review required, based on our proprietary credit and fraud scoring models and affordability assessments. Once approved, the customer is provided the loan amount and relevant terms of the credit being offered. Of the less than 5% of loan applications requiring manual review, the majority require further documentation, which can be provided via scanning, fax, email or mail. Others may have failed a fraud rule in the applicable underwriting methodology and are managed based on the rule failed, and others are reviewed to address “know your customer” and/or OFAC requirements. We provide declined customers with the reasons for the decision as per regulatory requirements.
Elevate fraud detection agents manually review a limited number of applicants based on the results of the fraud scores and any discrepancies in the application data they provide (such as identity information prior to the funding of the loan). Fraud detection specialists generate and review intraday reports to identify cross-application fraud risk and use such reports to flag additional loan applications requiring review. They also use sophisticated link analysis of application information to identify potentially fraudulent activity and pursue additional investigation if fraud is suspected.
Commitment to research and development
Our Risk Management and Technology department represents over half of our workforce, with a focus on analysis of new (typically non-traditional) data sources and analytical techniques. We believe our commitment to research and development in risk analytics results in consistently improving capabilities, which give us an on-going competitive advantage in the market by allowing us to scale our business while providing savings back to our customers in the form of lower rates.
OUR SALES AND MARKETING CAPABILITIES
Multi-channel approach to customer acquisition
Online providers of non-prime credit often rely on third-party lead generators for customer acquisition, which we believe limits growth and provides challenges to achieving cost and quality targets. In contrast, we rely on a multi-channel marketing mix, which supports improved CAC, faster growth and heightened brand awareness. 
This approach allows us to gradually expand investments to grow prospects, while thoughtfully balancing the investment split within channels. We monitor each channel, and how each contributes to a user's path to conversion. In addition to optimizing the performance of each channel, we are increasingly optimizing our marketing mix to improve marketing impact and enhance brand-building. We have found that coordinating the timing of individual channel campaigns and leveraging creative across channels can accelerate growth at lower costs. 
Our multi-channel approach is composed of the following:
Ø    Direct mail: More than 22 million pre-selected credit offers mailed during the year ended December 31, 2020;
Ø    Strategic partnerships: Multiple partnerships with large customer aggregators to drive traffic; and
Ø    Digital marketing campaigns: Search engine optimization, content marketing, social media, paid search, digital advertising and email marketing.
Analytically-driven channel optimization
Each new marketing channel we introduce requires extensive testing and optimization before it can be scaled cost-effectively and requires significant on-going analytical support. For instance, we spent several years developing, testing, and optimizing our response and credit models for pre-approved direct mail campaigns to achieve an acceptable CAC for this channel. As a result, direct mail is now our largest and most profitable marketing capability, and we continue to identify new analytical approaches that help expand the addressable market through the direct mail channel.
Over the last few years, we've built a successful digital acquisition strategy and found the right baseline tactics to drive strong conversions. We continuously test within our digital channels and have a pipeline of new testing opportunities to help identify strong performers. In order to scale up support, we are focusing on testing tactics which help drive consumer awareness and engagement through search, digital advertising and social media. We anticipate expanding growth in all of our digital marketing channels based on improved customer targeting analytics and increasingly sophisticated response models that allow us to enhance our marketing reach while maintaining our target CAC. Our dedicated channel management teams continually monitor and manage campaign effectiveness. We believe our investment in developing multiple customer acquisition channels provides a significant competitive advantage over other online non-prime lenders who rely primarily on lead generators.
Strategic partner development
Rather than utilizing lead generators who are often accused of deceptive practices, we have focused on developing relationships through large strategic partnerships with trusted brands. Our strategic partners refer prospects from their site to our product website. Because the customer completes the loan application on our website, rather than on a lead generator’s site, we control the messaging received by the customer about our products. This method allows us to better control application quality, customer experience and CAC. We also have the ability to make targeted offers with discounted rates to strategic partners who have been shown to deliver higher quality applicants. Aligning with strategic partners that share our values and commitment to the customer helps us fulfill our mission of providing better products to the New Middle Class. 
We expect our relationships with strategic partners to continue to expand over time, and we will evaluate opportunities to enter into additional new partnerships. 
Customer relationship optimization
Our sales and marketing efforts are not only focused on acquiring new customers. We focus on strong customer engagement, providing added value and developing a mutually beneficial relationship with current and former customers. If customers or former customers need additional liquidity, we strive to be the top of their consideration set. Based on rigorous creditworthiness and affordability analysis, we typically offer increased credit lines to former customers—often at lower rates. Also, subject to our usage caps, we may offer current customers the ability to refinance loans to receive additional funds. We use both email and text messaging campaigns to reach customers with additional credit offers. Because there is no additional CAC for originating these additional loans, these transactions are highly profitable and can support offering a lower APR for consumers.
OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM AND INFORMATION SECURITY
Underlying our innovative customer centric product offerings, loan processing and multitude of servicing features is our flexible proven technology platform. Loan originations, advanced proprietary underwriting and decisioning, loan management and loan servicing are all supported by our scalable and flexible technology platform built with modern cloud-based architecture principles. Our continuous technological innovations to our platform position us to respond quickly to new market opportunities, customer feedback, market trends and regulatory changes. Inherent to our technology platform is support and monitoring for compliant applications, loan processing and business controls. In addition, because we collect and store extensive amounts of consumer information, we have invested in and are committed to best practice levels of information security.
Flexible and scalable proven technology platform
Our proven technology platform integrates the best available third-party products and capabilities under our proprietary architecture. This has allowed us to rapidly launch new products, modify product functionality and ensure regulatory compliance. Our platform includes proprietary modular architecture that facilitates high-availability, scalability and flexibility for changing product features. It supports open-end (lines of credit) products, closed-end (installment loans) and credit cards, and is easily configurable for new pricing and term structures, whether in response to regulatory changes or competitive opportunities. Currently, our technology platform supports our Rise and Elastic brands. The Today Card utilizes Total Systems Services, a global payment solution provider ("TSYS"), to store data and provide servicing functionality. 
The core functionality of Elevate's technology platform is illustrated below.
Mobile-first approach to user interface development
Currently, approximately two-thirds of our customer interactions come from mobile rather than desktop devices. The customer-facing portions of our products for both desktop and mobile interfaces are designed with a focus on user-friendly design and cross-platform mobility.
Cloud-hosted applications
Leveraging cloud technology for our customer-facing web applications, we are able to support rapid enhancements and optimizations to improve user experiences. Our front-end technology approach enables different user application flows for different customers depending on what channel they came to our site and will dynamically change the user interface data capture based on credit assessment. Our marketing and user experience teams can rapidly test new application flows on small percentages of inbound traffic to determine the impact of such changes on loan conversion, underwriting accuracy, and customer satisfaction prior to full deployment.
Sophisticated decision engine
Our sophisticated analytics approach requires us to manage numerous credit and fraud scores and strategies for each of our products, customer segments and marketing channels. In addition, because of our commitment to innovation and research and development, we regularly conduct testing of new scores, data providers and analytical techniques. This requires an extremely flexible yet compliant decision engine. Our decision engine is a key component of our technology platform and allows our Risk Management team to rapidly implement tests that control and measure the performance of new scores, data providers and analytical techniques against the existing best versions of each. In particular, the decision engine can rapidly integrate with new data providers and test a randomly selected percentage of application traffic with new scores and track their performance against existing scores.
All aspects of our underwriting process are controlled through components of our technology platform, from the credit and fraud scores to the various product affordability assessments, to the instant decisioning and credit assignment process and even including the fraud and verifications activities performed by fraud agents. In this manner, we have enhanced automation and have instituted tight controls over the entire decisioning process.
Best practice approach to information security and system reliability
Because we store extensive amounts of public and non-public customer personally identifiable information (“PII”), we take our obligations to protect that information and avoid data breaches very seriously. PII in Elevate's technology platform is encrypted, and we conduct regular audits of our security protocols via third-party intrusion detection, vulnerability scans and penetration testing. These activities are supplemented with real-time monitoring and alerting for potential intrusions.
We have fully redundant capabilities in place to support all critical business functions through geographically separated data centers and utilization of the latest in cloud-based site recovery. Disaster recovery and business continuity plans and tests have been completed, which help to ensure our ability to recover in the event of a disaster or other unforeseen event. 
COMPETITIVE OVERVIEW
The competition in our market is composed of both legacy brick-and-mortar and online credit providers. We compete with providers that offer products in the following categories:
Ø    Non-prime installment loans
Ø    Non-prime credit cards
Ø    Pawn loans
Ø    Payday loans
Ø    Title loans
Ø    Rent to own
In addition, bank overdrafts often function as an expensive form of emergency credit. According to a 2008 study by the FDIC, bank overdraft fees can have an effective APR greater than 3,500%, depending upon the amount of the overdraft transaction and length of time to bring the account positive.
Most legacy non-prime lenders still operate primarily out of brick-and-mortar locations and require extensive documentation and face-to-face interactions. With online and mobile-only products, Elevate eliminates the potential need for our customers to drive across town and stand in line to apply for credit. In fact, with our products, we typically deliver credit determination in seconds.
There are few providers attempting to deliver lower-cost, online non-prime credit products similar to ours. Although there are a number of technology-enabled financial services companies that target prime and near-prime customers, including LendingClub, Prosper and Avant, there are only a limited number of comparable online competitors in the non-prime lending space, such as OppLoans and NetCredit. We expect more entrants in this space as this market continues to develop. We also believe that it would require significant time and expense for other companies to build technological and analytical platforms similar to ours, which is geared towards serving non-prime consumers. While other lenders may use proprietary or off-the-shelf lending platforms to support their online lending operations, these typically are focused on specific product types, and this makes such platforms inflexible for the kind of product innovation that we have pursued. We are not aware of any off-the-shelf products that support the variety of non-prime products such as those supported by our proven technology platform and proprietary risk analytics infrastructure. Although technology generally can be reverse-engineered over time, we believe our proven and proprietary technology and analytics platforms provide a competitive advantage due to our lead time based on our long history of serving non-prime consumers with multiple credit products.
The online non-prime credit market in the US is extremely fragmented and most lenders source customers from lead generation companies, resulting in low brand recognition. Unlike these competitors, we have made a significant investment in establishing a direct-to-consumer, integrated multi-channel marketing capability using direct mail, search engine marketing, search engine optimization, and digital campaigns, which we believe creates a unique opportunity for Rise, Elastic and the Today Card to become dominant and trusted brands in this space.
REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
The online consumer loan products we currently originate or support are subject to a range of laws, regulations and standards that address consumer lending, banking, credit services, consumer protections and reporting, information sharing, marketing, debt collection, data protection, state licensing and interest rate and term limitations, among other things.
All products are subject to supervision, regulation and / or enforcement by numerous regulatory bodies—from state regulators and attorneys general, federal regulators, like the CFPB, the FTC and in some cases the FDIC. Consistent with regulatory expectations, we have an extensive compliance program and internal controls. 
For a discussion of the risks related to our regulatory environment, see “Risk factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—The consumer lending industry continues to be subject to new laws and regulations in many jurisdictions that could restrict the consumer lending products and services we offer, impose additional compliance costs on us, render our current operations unprofitable or even prohibit our current operations” and “Risk factors—Other Risks Related to Compliance and Regulation.”
State and local regulation and licensing applicable to products originated by Elevate
The Rise loans we originate directly to customers are regulated under a variety of enabling state statutes. The scope of state regulation, including permissible interest rates, fees and terms, varies from state to state. Some states require specific disclosures, mandate or prohibit certain terms and limit the maximum interest rate and fees that may be charged. Where licensing or registration is required, we are subject to extensive state rules, licensing and examination. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in, among other things, refunds of excess charges, monetary penalties, revocation of required licenses, voiding of loans and other administrative enforcement actions. These Rise loans are available in the following 12 states: Alabama, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin. In these states, Rise may also be subject to additional municipal regulations and ordinances related to, for example, certain non-bank loan products and debt collection. The scope of municipal regulations and ordinances vary. Several state regulators have publicly expressed their intent to increase supervision and enforcement of consumer protection laws against supervised entities. State consumer protection laws also apply to Rise installment loans. In many states, legislators and attorneys general could increase their focus or enforcement of these consumer protection statutes. If this were to occur, it could result in additional regulatory oversight and enforcement on our business.
US state and federal regulation
All of our products are subject to a variety of state and federal laws, including but not limited to the following:
Truth in Lending Act.    The federal Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”) and its underlying regulations known as Regulation Z require creditors to deliver disclosures to borrowers during the life cycle of a loan—certain advertisements, at application, at account opening or at consummation and for open-end credit products, such as Elastic and Today Card, periodically, and for certain post-consummation events (e.g., refinancings, change in terms for open-end credit).
Under the appropriate disclosure rules, the originating creditor is required to provide borrowers with key information about the loan, including, for open-end credit, the annual percentage rate (if applicable), applicable finance charges, transaction and penalty fees, and, for closed-end loans, the annual percentage rate, the finance charge, the amount financed, the total of payments, the number and amount of payments and payment due dates. Consumers are provided substantive protections regarding loan products under Regulation Z and TILA with special rules for calculating annual percentage rates, advertising, and rules for resolving billing errors for open-ended credit.
Fair Credit Reporting Act.    We are also subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (the “FCRA”) and similar state laws, as both a user of consumer reports and a furnisher of consumer credit information to credit reporting agencies. The FCRA and similar state laws regulate the use of consumer reports and reporting of information to credit reporting agencies. Specifically, the FCRA establishes requirements that apply to the use of “consumer reports” and similar data, including certain notifications to consumers, including when an adverse action, such as a loan declination, is based on information contained in a consumer report. We only obtain and use consumer reports subject to the permissible purpose requirements under the FCRA, which also permits us to share our experience information, information obtained from credit reporting agencies, and other customer information with affiliates. We comply with notice and opt out requirements for prescreen solicitations and for certain information sharing under the FCRA. We also have implemented an identity theft prevention program to fulfill the requirements of the Red Flags Regulations and Guidelines issued under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (the “FACT Act”).
In meeting our duties to furnish consumer credit information to consumer reporting agencies, we:
Ø    furnish consumer credit information pursuant to the METRO 2 guidelines;
Ø    establish and maintain procedures regarding the accuracy and integrity of the consumer credit information we report; and
Ø    establish and maintain procedures to conduct timely investigations of customer disputes (received directly from customers or through credit reporting agencies) regarding the consumer credit information we report to the consumer reporting agencies.
Equal Credit Opportunity Act.    The federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act (the “ECOA”) generally prohibits creditors from discriminating against applicants on the basis of race, color, sex, age (provided the individual is of legal age to enter into a contract), religion, national origin, marital status, the fact that all or part of the applicant’s income derives from any public assistance program or the fact that the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the federal Consumer Credit Protection Act. Regulation B, which implements ECOA, restricts creditors from requesting certain types of information from loan applicants and from using advertising or making statements that would discourage, on a prohibited basis, a reasonable person from making or pursuing an application.
In the underwriting of loans offered through our online platform, and with respect to all aspects of the credit transaction, including any servicing of loans and other credit, we, our lending partners and marketing affiliates must comply with applicable provisions prohibiting discouragement and discrimination.
ECOA also requires creditors to provide consumers with timely notices of adverse action taken on credit applications or counteroffers. A prospective borrower applying for a loan but denied credit or offered a counteroffer is provided with an adverse action notice.
FTC Act and Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.    Both the FTC and CFPB regulate advertising, marketing of and practices related to financial products and services. The FTC is charged with preventing unfair or deceptive acts or practices and false or misleading advertisements, and the CFPB is charged with preventing unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices. 
Unfair, Deceptive, Abusive Acts and Practices.    The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts or practices (“UDAAPs”). Through enforcement actions, the CFPB has found UDAAP conduct in most phases in the life cycle of a loan, including the marketing, collecting and reporting of loans. UDAAPs could involve omissions or misrepresentations of important information to consumers or practices that take advantages of vulnerable consumers, such as elderly or low-income consumers. All products and services provided by Elevate and its vendors are subject to the UDAAP prohibition. There are also various state laws that govern unfair and deceptive acts and practices with which we must comply.
Military Lending Act.    The Military Lending Act (“MLA”) restricts, among other things, the interest rate and other terms that can be offered to active military personnel and their dependents on most types of consumer credit. The MLA caps the interest rate that may be offered to a covered borrower to a 36% military annual percentage rate (“MAPR”), which includes certain fees such as application fees, participation fees and fees for add-on products. The MLA also requires certain disclosures and prohibits certain terms, such as mandatory arbitration if a dispute arises concerning the consumer credit product. The MLA covers Elastic, Rise and the Today Card and restricts our, or our bank partners', ability to offer our products to military personnel and their dependents. Failure to comply with the MLA may limit our ability to collect principal, interest, and fees from borrowers and may result in civil and criminal liability that could harm our business.
The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.    The federal Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (“SCRA”) and similar state laws apply to certain loans made to certain members of the US military, reservists and members of the National Guard and certain dependents. The SCRA limits the interest rate a creditor may charge or certain collection actions a creditor may take on certain loans while a servicemember is on military duty. We maintain policies and procedures to comply with SCRA.
The Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act.    The federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (“E-SIGN”) and similar state laws, particularly the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (“UETA”) authorize the creation of legally binding and enforceable agreements utilizing electronic records and signatures. E-SIGN and UETA require businesses that use electronic records or signatures in consumer transactions and provide required disclosures to consumers electronically, to obtain the consumer’s consent to receive information electronically. When a borrower is provided electronic disclosures, we obtain his or her consent to transact business electronically, to receive electronic disclosures and maintain electronic records in compliance with E-SIGN and UETA requirements. We also follow similar state e-signature rules mandating that certain disclosures be made, and certain steps be followed, in order to obtain and authenticate e-signatures.
Electronic Fund Transfer Act.    The Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978 (“EFTA”) protects consumers engaging in electronic fund transfers, including preauthorized transactions and recurring transactions. The EFTA is implemented through Regulation E. Borrowers of our products often choose to repay by electronic fund transfers (“EFTs”) and, accordingly, a written authorization, signed or similarly authenticated, may be required in connection with auto-pay features. To the extent a borrower repays his or her payment obligation through EFTs, the EFTA and Regulation E apply, and contain restrictions and disclosure requirements while providing consumers certain rights relating to EFTs. Restrictions on how consumers choose to pay or how lenders comply with EFTs could impact our current business processes.
Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.    The federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (the “FDCPA”) provides guidelines and limitations on the conduct of third-party debt collectors and debt buyers when collecting consumer debt. While the FDCPA generally does not apply to first-party creditors collecting their own debts or to servicers when collecting debts that were current when servicing began, we use the FDCPA as a guideline for all collections. We require all vendors and third parties that provide collection services on our behalf to comply with the FDCPA to the extent applicable. We also comply with state and local laws that apply to creditors and provide guidance and limitations similar to the FDCPA.
Fair Credit Billing Act - The Fair Credit Billing Act ("FCBA") protects consumers from prejudicial or unfair billing practices in open-ended lines of credit and credit cards. It lays out consumers' rights to dispute credit card issuers' charges and addresses consumer redress for common billing errors.
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.    We are also subject to various federal and state laws and regulations relating to privacy and security of consumers’ nonpublic personal information. Under these laws, including the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) and Regulation P promulgated thereunder, we must disclose our privacy policy and practices, including those policies relating to the sharing of nonpublic personal information with third parties. We may also be required to provide an opt-out to certain sharing. The GLBA and other laws also require us to safeguard personal information. The FTC regulates the safeguarding requirements of the GLBA for non-bank lenders through its Safeguard Rules.
Anti-money laundering and economic sanctions.    We and the originating lenders that we work with are also subject to certain provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act and the Bank Secrecy Act under which we must maintain an anti-money laundering compliance program covering certain of our business activities. In addition, the Office of Foreign Assets Control prohibits us from engaging in financial transactions with specially designated nationals.
Anticorruption.    We are also subject to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) which generally prohibits companies and their agents or intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business and/or other benefits.
Telemarketing Sales Rule.  We are also subject to the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, the FTC’s Telemarketing Sales Rule promulgated pursuant to such Act, and similar state laws. The Telemarketing Sales Rule prohibits deceptive and abusive telemarketing acts or practices, such as calling before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m., and requires telemarketers and sellers to make certain disclosures to consumers in every outbound call. Telemarketers are also required to comply with a company specific do-not-call framework, as well as with state and federal do-not-call registries. We have implemented policies and procedures reasonably designed to comply with the Telemarketing Sales Rule.
Telephone Consumer Protection Act. We are also subject to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and its implementing regulations (together, the “TCPA”) and the regulations of the FCC. The TCPA regulates the delivery of live and prerecorded telemarketing calls, non-marketing calls to cell phones through the use of an automated telephone dialing system, fax advertisements, and text messages. For example, under the TCPA, it is unlawful to make many of these types of communications without the prior consent of the recipient. The TCPA also established a federal do-not-call registry, with the Telemarketing Sales Rule, as noted above. We maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to comply with the TCPA.
CAN-SPAM Act. We are subject to the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 and the FTC’s rules promulgated pursuant to such Act (together, “CAN-SPAM Act”), which establish requirements for certain “commercial messages” and “transactional or relationship messages.” For example, the CAN-SPAM Act prohibits the sending of messages that contain false, deceptive or misleading information. It also gives recipients the right to stop receiving commercial messages. We have implemented policies and procedures reasonably designed to comply with the CAN-SPAM Act.
CARD Act. The Today Card is subject to the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure ("CARD") Act that establishes fair and transparent practices relating to credit cards. The CARD Act, among other things, provides protections for consumers such as limiting interest rate hikes, banning the issuance of credit cards to anyone less than 21 years of age without an adult co-signer, limiting over-limit, late and account-opening fees, and requiring transparent disclosures related to minimum payments.
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
The CFPB regulates consumer financial products and services, including the consumer loans that we offer. The CFPB has regulatory, supervisory and enforcement powers over certain providers of consumer financial products and services. For a discussion of the risks to our business related to CFPB regulation, see “Risk factors— The CFPB may have examination authority over our consumer lending business that could have a significant impact on our business” and “Risk factors— The CFPB issued a final ruling on July 7, 2020 affecting the consumer lending industry, and this or subsequent new rules and regulations, if they are finalized, may impact our consumer lending business.”
Federal Trade Commission
The Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") enforces the safeguarding requirements of the GLBA against non-banks pursuant its authority to enforce Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices. In addition, the FTC has a history of pursuing enforcement actions against non-bank lenders and online lead generators for alleged unfair or deceptive acts or practices in connection with the marketing or servicing of consumer credit products and services. Like the CFPB, the FTC may issue fines and corrective orders that could require us to make revisions to our existing business models. The FTC has jurisdiction over Elevate and its business practices.
United Kingdom ("UK")
Prior to June 29, 2020, we provided services in the United Kingdom ("UK") through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Elevate Credit International Limited (“ECIL”) under the brand name ‘Sunny.’ During the year ended December 31, 2018, ECIL began to receive an increased number of customer complaints initiated by claims management companies ("CMCs") related to the affordability assessment of certain loans. The CMCs' campaign against the high cost lending industry increased significantly during the third and fourth quarters of 2018 and continued through 2019 and into the first half of 2020, resulting in a significant increase in affordability claims against all companies in the industry over this period. The Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA"), a regulator in the UK financial services industry, began regulating the CMCs in April 2019 in order to ensure that the methods used by the CMCs are in the best interests of the consumer and the industry. Separately, the FCA asked all industry participants to review their lending practices to ensure that such companies are using an appropriate affordability and creditworthiness analysis. However, there continued to be a lack of clarity within the regulatory environment in the UK. This lack of clarity, coupled with the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on the UK market for Sunny, led the ECIL board of directors to place ECIL into administration under the UK Insolvency Act 1986 and appoint insolvency practitioners from KPMG LLP to take control and management of the UK business. As a result, we have deconsolidated ECIL and are presenting its results as discontinued operations in all periods presented unless otherwise noted.
HUMAN CAPITAL
We are committed to building and nurturing a distinctive corporate culture of innovation, excellence, collaboration and integrity. Our key company values based on how we expect ourselves to serve our customers, owners and each other are:
Ø    Think Big.    We have always been an innovator in our industry. Ideas, both big and small, are our competitive advantage. We share a responsibility to think out of the box, challenge the status quo and embrace change.
Ø    Raise the Bar.    Excellence is not a skill. It is a habit—the gradual result of always striving to do better. As a company and as individuals we push ourselves to build on success, learn from failure and get better every day.
Ø    Win Together.    Our goals are too big to achieve as individuals. Collaboration is not a by-product of our work, it is the primary focus. It is also more fun.
Ø    Do the Right Thing.    Doing the right thing is not optional. We hold each other to the highest standards and earn our reputation every day.
Our values are reinforced in all aspects of our employees’ relationship with our company, including during the recruiting process, quarterly check-ins and annual performance reviews. In addition, each quarter, employees who demonstrate these values are nominated for “Smart Awards” and individuals and teams are selected and recognized at all-company Town Hall meetings. We are focused on attracting talented employees who embody innovation, collaboration and commitment to our core values. An integral part of our hiring process is our intern program, which helps to ensure we continually have a pipeline of talent throughout the year.
The technology sector is rapidly evolving, so we meaningfully invest in programs like Azure certification to advance the skills of our workforce. We retain talent by providing market-competitive compensation and benefits, including incentives and recognition programs, leadership development opportunities, and tuition assistance, and by fostering a company culture that gets stronger each year. 
Elevate has been certified as a "Great Place to Work" from 2016 to 2020 based on a comparison of our employees' survey responses to responses of hundreds of other companies. We believe this reflects our commitment to build a strong and lasting company and corporate culture. We expanded Employee Resource Groups, which are voluntary, employee-led groups that help connect communities, raise broader awareness around Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, and enable us to leverage our differences. Additionally, in 2020, we appointed a Chief Diversity Officer, whose oversight is intended to ensure that we continue to pursue diversity in our workforce and leadership positions. 
As a result of the pandemic, 100% of our workforce transitioned to work from home in March 2020. Halfway into the year, we found the need to reduce our workforce due to the economic impacts of COVID-19. Our voluntary turnover rate for 2020, which does not include our reduction of the domestic workforce by approximately 17% effective July 2020, was 14%. Our top priority continues to be the care, safety and well-being of our staff. As part of our further response to the pandemic, we provided two weeks of COVID-19 relief paid time off, stipends, half days off to recharge and two additional paid holidays. We continually surveyed our staff to keep them engaged and informed as they worked from home. Our working parents were provided flexible schedules to assist in managing work and childcare responsibilities and Elevate was recently named a “Best Place for Working Parents” in Fort Worth and Dallas, Texas. Our employee development programs transitioned to remote delivery, and we supported staff with virtual breakrooms, monthly fitness challenges and a drive-through holiday experience.
As of December 31, 2020, we had 437 full-time employees, including 213 in technology, 47 in risk management, 58 in marketing and product development, 63 in customer support and loan operations and 56 in general and support functions. We also outsource certain functions, such as collections and customer service to increase efficiencies and scalability. We use an internal quality team to review and improve third-party performance.
OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Protecting our rights to our intellectual property is critical, as it enhances our ability to offer distinctive services and products to our customers, which differentiates us from our competitors. We rely on a combination of trademark laws and trade secret protections in the US and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect the intellectual property rights related to our proprietary analytics, predictive underwriting models and software systems. We have either registered trademarks and/or pending applications in the US for the marks Elevate, Rise, Elastic and Today Card. Our trademarks are materially important to us and we anticipate maintaining them and renewing them.
OUR HISTORY
We were created through the spin-off of the direct lending and branded product businesses of TFI, which was founded in 2001. Prior to the spin-off transaction, TFI had two discrete lines of business: (1) a direct lender and branded product provider to non-prime consumers; and (2) a licensor of its technology platform to third-party lenders. In order to allow each of these separate lines of business to focus on its relative strategic and operational strengths and future business plans, the board of directors of TFI decided to spin off its direct lending and branded products business into a separate company.
We were incorporated in Delaware on January 31, 2014 as a subsidiary of TFI, and we had no material assets or activities as a separate corporate entity until the spin-off occurred. On May 1, 2014, TFI contributed the assets and liabilities associated with its direct lending and branded products business to us and distributed its interest in our Company to its stockholders, but retained the assets and liabilities associated with its licensed technology platform line of business. TFI’s retained business line entails providing marketing services to third-party lenders and licensing TFI’s technology platform to these lenders for marketing and licensing fees. TFI previously conducted its direct lending business through various legal entity subsidiaries, which were contributed to us in the spin-off transaction.
On April 11, 2017, we closed an initial public offering (“IPO”) of 12,400,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $6.50 per share to the public. In connection with the closing, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase in full for an additional 1,860,000 shares. On April 6, 2017, our stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “ELVT.”
