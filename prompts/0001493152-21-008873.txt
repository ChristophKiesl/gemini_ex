ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 
The Company was incorporated on November 3, 2008 under the laws of the State of Nevada, to engage in certain business services. Our goal is to become a leading tournament gaming provider as well as an online destination, targeting over 250 million esports players and participants worldwide that want to compete at the high school or college level. We are a developmental stage business, have generated limited revenues to date and have a history of operating losses.
 
The Good Gaming platform was established in early 2014 by its founding members who recognized the need that millions of gamers worldwide desired to play games at competitive levels. The founders recognized that there was no structure or organization on a large scale for amateur gamers while professional esports was quickly establishing itself.
 
Good Gaming is effectively building the business infrastructure for the rapidly growing esports industry, similar to the high school and college athletic industry. Good Gaming is designed to be the gateway for amateur esports athletes to compete at the semi-professional level, improve their gaming skills, and interact with veteran gamers globally in a destination site and social networking framework.
 
Good Gaming differs from the professional level of the esports industry by focusing on more than 250 million gamers that fall below the professional level but are above the casual level, classified as “amateurs.” Good Gaming distinguishes itself from its direct and indirect competitors by being the first company to offer multi-game, multi-console services at the amateur esports level. The Company is not exclusive to any particular hardware or software vendor.

In September of 2017, the Company began focusing on its Minecraft server by enhancing the development staff and launched an offering of microtransactions after it saw the opportunity to generate revenue without adding a great deal of overhead. The initial offering of microtransactions exceeded revenue expectations and the Company has continued to expand the Minecraft server offerings. The Company also began pursuing the acquisition of additional Minecraft servers that were already established to begin scaling this effort.
 
In December of 2017, the Company began exploring potential partnerships with various franchise opportunities related to both LAN centers and Virtual Reality centers. Financial analysis and research on these opportunities is ongoing.
 
On March 21, 2018, the Company acquired Crypto Strategies Group, Inc. for consideration of $500. The Company intends to diversify its business and enter into the cryptocurrency market through such acquisition.
 
On December 12, 2018, the Company dissolved Crypto Strategies Group, Inc.
 
In March 2019, the Company discontinued Minecade and Olimpo servers and decided to focus on the core Good Gaming servers.
 
On March 11, 2019, Eric Brown resigned from the Chief Operating Officer’s position.
 
Technology
 
In 2016, the Company completed its 2.0 tournament platform and thereafter ran dozens of robotic internal test tournaments and held numerous free-to-play tournaments on large scales with its partner The Syndicate, the owner of the world’s longest running online gaming guild that has 1,200 members worldwide. Good Gaming conducted two closed public beta tournaments of hundreds of participants in May 2016 in order to fully vet the system. After making roughly 100 fixes and changes to the system, it now runs smoothly. The system is designed to scale to 512,000 concurrent competitors. The Company has updated the system to handle team tournaments, which will further expand its opportunity to popular titles that have tens of millions of active players and has recently launched titles that have the potential for cross-platform play among Gaming PC, Microsoft Xbox and Sony PlayStation.
 
In 2017, the Company ran hundreds of tournaments on a regular basis with a dedicated customer base of over 30,000 members. Additionally, the Company expanded its website by offering content relevant to the member base with information relating to game play strategy and game news. This generated nearly 100,000 unique visits per month. In an effort to monetize that traffic, the Company employed the use of Google display advertising and tested a subscription model. After careful evaluation of the Company’s strategy, management decided to move away from free tournaments and custom content and focus on growing and monetizing our Minecraft server, which has grown substantially in popularity. This decision was a result of comprehensive competitive analysis and evaluations made in how the esports industry was shifting in its space. Tournaments and custom content are currently suspended while the Company grows revenue and focuses on expanding its efforts with Minecraft. The Company has also aggressively evaluated several business models and acquisition opportunities to resume its previous success as it is related to tournaments.
 
In 2018, the Company acquired the Minecade and Olimpo Minecraft servers in order to deliver on expansion efforts. This move, coupled with continued advancement of the core Good Gaming Minecraft server substantially increased revenues and traffic. By the end of the year, the Company struck a deal with a prominent Minecraft influencer, which resulted in the single highest monthly earnings achieved within the Minecraft division, to date.
 
In 2019, following a severe downturn of business in the Minecraft sector as a whole, the Company decided to temporarily suspend the Minecade and Olimpo networks and refocus its efforts back on the core Good Gaming server. Much of the year was spent upgrading and overhauling the server’s existing infrastructure, which had grown stale over prior years. The Company adapted its strategy to target long term success and consistency through major innovations in the SkyBlock and Prison game modes, and began work towards an ambitious full recode of the Minecade server.

In 2020, the Company finalized its infrastructure overhaul for use in upcoming releases. A new, experimental version of Prison, Prison MMO, was launched as an early access game mode in February 2020. Prison MMO is designed to be a self-sustaining Minecraft game mode which incorporates elements of the Massively Multiplayer Online video game genre. The Company expects steady growth from this mode as it continues developing Prison MMO. On April 1st, 2020, the company released its first iteration of a new SkyBlock gamemode, SkyBlock Spring, to some strong success. During the third quarter of 2020, the Company implemented a new workflow management style and released its summer edition of SkyBlock. The release of the summer edition signified a renewed focus on consistent growth through regular, player focused updates. The Company’s fall release of Prison in October 2020 resulted in its single highest revenue producing month of the year, to date.
 
Business Strategy
 
In the past, our management team’s strategy was to be a full-service company providing best in class tournaments, the best platform on which they are played, and content that is all about the esports world. We have looked at this strategy and have changed the way we view our business.
 
It was our ambition and strategy to be great at providing a place for amateurs to play esports. By focusing on what the gaming universe is lacking, it allowed us to focus on the promotion of teams, leagues and competition. We intended to begin with local servers and expand organically from there. We recognized there are millions of players who desire to compete within the gaming community.
 
However, as tournaments and investment in servers were not profitable to the Company, we have decided to focus on Minecraft. We have a well-established server and will continue to devote resources to developing and modifying Minecraft assets by introducing new SkyBlock Seasons and Minecraft Prison game modes within our servers. We feel that we have learned how to monetize this and will be able to continue to grow and have it as a meaningful part of our business strategy.
