Item 1. Business.
General Information
 Medtainer, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Florida on September 5, 1997. It changed its corporate name to Acology, Inc. on January 9, 2014, and on August 28, 2018, to Medtainer, Inc. Prior to January 1, 2018, the Company sold its products through its wholly owned subsidiary, D&C Distributors LLC, a California limited liability company, which commenced operations on January 29, 2013, and which the Company acquired by merger on March 28, 2014, and performed its printing services through its wholly owned subsidiary, D&C Printing LLC, a California limited liability company, which was established by the Company and commenced operations on April 14, 2015. Commencing on January 1, 2018, the Company has itself conducted all of its business.
 The Company has authorized capital of 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.00001 per share (“Common Stock”), and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, without par value. On March 22, 2019, the Company implemented a reverse split of its Common Stock on the basis of one share for each 100 shares then outstanding. Also, on that date, the Company reduced the number of authorized shares of Common Stock from 6,000,000,000 to 100,000,000, while the number of authorized shares of preferred stock remained 10,000,000. The effects of the reverse split have been retroactively applied to all periods covered by this report.
 The Company’s principal place of business, which is its only facility, is located at 1620 Commerce St., Corona, CA 92880. The Company’s telephone number is (844) 226-5649. The Company’s corporate website address is http://www.medtainer.com. The Common Stock is quoted on the OTC Pink tier of OTC Link, a quotation system operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. (“OTC Link”) under the trading symbol MDTR.
 Products and Services
 The Company’s principal product is the Medtainer®, which is used to store pharmaceuticals, herbs, teas and other solids or liquids and can grind solids and shred herbs. The Medtainer® is described under the caption “Item 1. Business – Products and Services – The Medtainer®.”
 The Company has expanded its product base into other areas to capture opportunities made available to it through its core base of its Medtainer® products. The most significant components of revenues from other products were humidity pack inserts, lighters, plastic container holders, smell-proof bags and other goods. The Company is developing markets for these products. These products are described under the caption “Item 1. Business – Products and Services – Other Products.” The Company provides private labeling and branding services for purchasers of containers and other products. For further details, see “Item 1. Business – Printing.”

 The Company markets directly to businesses through its phone room, to the retail public through internet sales, and directly to wholesalers and other businesses who resell its products to other businesses and end users. See “Item 1. Business – Sales and Distribution.”
 Because the Company’s printing business is a service that relates principally to its Medtainer® products and lighters and because it accounts for an immaterial portion of the Company’s revenue, the Company regards itself as having a single segment.
 The Medtainer®
 Medtainers® are manufactured from medical-grade polypropylene resin. They can store pharmaceuticals, herbs, teas and other solids or liquids and can grind solids and shred herbs and are air- and water-tight. The Company sells the original 20-dram version, a 20-dram version that has received child safety certification, and a 40-dram version. The Company is focusing its marketing of Medtainers® on the Cannabis/CBD markets, as well as drug stores and drug store chains, veterinarians and veterinary distributors and other distributors and end users.
 Medtainers® have three components. The top component is a cap, the middle component is a storage cup with grinding/shredding teeth projecting downward from its bottom and the bottom component is a grinding/shredding cup with teeth projecting upward from its bottom. Material is transferred from the storage cup into the grinding/shredding cup, the storage cup is inserted into the grinding/shredding cup, forming a space in which the two sets of teeth intermesh, and the two cups are then rotated manually such that the material passes between the two sets of teeth and is ground or shredded. The ground or shredded material may then be returned to the storage cup for storage or used or dispensed in another manner. The cap attaches to the grinding/shredding cup such that the storage cup is held between them, forming a compact unit which is air- and water-tight between the cap and the storage cup, as well as between the storage cup and the bottom cup. The pictures below show exploded views of the non-childproof and childproof configurations of the Medtainer®.

Until June 8, 2018, the Company purchased Medtainers® from Polymation, LLC (“Polymation”), located in Newbury Park, California, under an agreement that it entered into with Polymation on August 13, 2013. Under this agreement, the Company had the exclusive worldwide right to purchase, promote, advertise, market, distribute and resell Medtainers®, with on which the owner of Polymation held patents and Polymation held the trademark. On June 8, 2018, the Company acquired these patents, the trademark and a domain name, agreed with Polymation to terminate the agreement, licensed Polymation to manufacture Medtainers® solely for purchase by the Company under the patents and entered into a production contract, dated June 8, 2018, which was amended on March 27, 2019, under which Polymation manufactures and the Company purchases Medtainers® (as so amended, the “Production Contract”). The Production Contract requires the Company to purchase at least 30,000 units per month, with that requirement increasing by 1% on each anniversary of its effective date, and sets prices for the products purchased thereunder, subject to periodic increase for changes in the local consumer-price index. Its term expires on April 30, 2031, unless the Company exercises a termination option, under which the Company may terminate the Production Contract upon payment to Polymation of $400,000, less any amount that its owner agrees that he owes to the Company or that he owes to it under a final and unappealable judgment, provided that the shares of Common Stock issued to him in the transaction in which the Company acquired the patent and trademark (see “Item 1. Business – Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property”) may be publicly sold under the exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) afforded by Rule 144 promulgated thereunder or another exemption from such registration.

Because the Company owns the patent for the Medtainer®, to the extent that it can sell more Medtainers® than it is required to purchase under the Production Contract, it will be able to manufacture them in-house or acquire them from a third party, possibly at prices lower than under the Production Contract, but unless the number of Medtainers® that the Company is not required to purchase under the Production Contract is substantial, doing so may not be cost-effective. The Company intends to continue its efforts to sell Medtainers® globally, which, if successful, would increase demand for Medtainers® and could cause increase sales volume with the result that the Company might produce them at its facilities or seek out a third party to manufacture them, instead of purchasing them from Polymation, if doing either were cost-effective. The Company presently has no suppliers other than Polymation for Medtainers®.
 The Company believes that the raw materials used by Polymation in manufacturing Medtainers® are readily available.
 Other Products
 In addition to Medtainers®, the Company sells and is actively developing markets for the following products, all of which it purchases from their manufacturers and resells:

● | Humidity Control Inserts. These inserts are placed into air- and water-tight containers, such as humidors and Medtainers®, to maintain humidity by adding or removing moisture. These inserts are of varying sizes and capable of maintaining various ranges of relative humidity, depending on the specifications of each particular insert. The Company purchases inserts from Boveda Inc. and Desiccare, Inc. and markets them under the Boveda or Desiccare label. The Company also has an agreement with Desiccare for it to private label inserts under the name “MED X 2 Way Humidity Control Pack” and markets some of the inserts it purchases from Desiccare under its own private label. The Company believes that marketing inserts under its own brand label is significant in that many of its Medtainer® products are now being sold with humidity packs inserted into the containers and that this “value added” factor has increased demand for its product.

● | Smell-Proof Bags. These airtight bags are made of flexible polyester, Mylar®, plastic and other substances, with such means of closure as Velcro®, Ziploc® and zippers. Some use activated carbon to enhance odor removal. They are of varying size and can be used to store and prevent dissipation of odors from fish, herbs and dirty clothes, among others.

● | Lighters. These are butane lighters that are sold with and without logos and other markings. The Company adds logos and markings based on customers' specifications.

There are numerous manufacturers of these products.
 Printing
 The Company began providing printing services in 2015. In 2019, it had revenue of $83,442 from printing, compared with $82,617 in 2018. The Company entered this business because some of its customers desired to have custom labels imprinted on the products that they purchased from the Company and the Company found that the cost of doing so through third parties raised the price that it charged to customers for imprinted products to levels that it believed would impede sales. Labelling is performed using two specialized printers, one of which is capable of printing on nonporous plastic. Currently, about 2,000 square feet is devoted to printing. The Company is seeking additional printing business from companies that require labelling on their own products.
Sales and Distribution
 The Company sells approximately 96% of its products to wholesalers and distributors, who resell them to businesses and consumers, with and without custom labeling; the remainder are sold directly to retail consumers through internet sales and at trade shows.
 The Company entered into a Product License and Distribution Agreement, dated April 1, 2014, with IGreen Planet Store, Ltd. (“IGreen”), a Canadian distribution company located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Under this agreement, the Company has granted to IGreen an exclusive license to market, sell and distribute Medtainers® in Canada. The agreement had a 5-year term, which has expired. The Company is negotiating a new agreement with IGreen and is conducting business with IGreen as if the expired agreement were still in effect. Under the agreement, the Company is required to maintain product liability insurance covering the products sold thereunder; the Company is in the process of doing so. IGreen is not required to purchase a minimum quantity of products. For the years 2019 and 2018, the Company’s sales to IGreen were $207,123 and $254,860, respectively, representing 10% and 11%, respectively, of total sales.
 As of May 27, 2020, the Company’s backlog of orders that it believed to be firm was $82,377, which the Company expects to fill during the current fiscal year. As of May 27, 2019, its backlog was $84,491, of which $42,457 was filled during 2019.
 Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, nine of the Company’s personnel worked in its phone room, making sales by telephone and over its website; the number as of May 28, 2020, was three.

The Company believes that social media are important to marketing its products and it maintains a presence on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and other social media.
 The Company believes that it is important to maintain strong relationships with its direct customers and its distributors, and, where possible, their customers and takes measures to do so.
 Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
 The Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of April 16, 2018, by and between the Company and the owner of Polymation, which was amended on June 8, 2018 (as so amended, the “APA”). Under the APA, the Company acquired from him and from certain entities that he controlled (including Polymation), patents and patent applications relating to the Medtainer®, a trademark of the name Medtainer® and an internet domain in consideration of its issuance to him of 2,631,252 shares of Common Stock.
 As a consequence of the acquisition of these patents and the trademark, the Company is able to defend the Medtainer® against infringement and counterfeiting more effectively than before the acquisition. The Company believes that such acquisition has enabled it to invite larger companies to explore the possibility of strategic partnerships, expand into other container markets and diversify into associated and/or new markets.
 While the Medtainer® is patented, similar products are being manufactured and sold. The Company has not determined whether all of these products conflict with the Medtainer® patents, but when it determines that a conflict exists, it takes measures to enforce its patents. The Company does not know to what extent these products have affected its business.
 The Company may license the Medtainer® patents and trademark to, and future, patents, trademarks, trade secrets and similar proprietary rights to and from, third parties.
 The Company employs various methods, including confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with third parties, employees and consultants, to protect its trade secrets and know-how. As it develops new products, the Company will rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, unpatented know-how, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights, nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to protect its proprietary rights. The Company cannot presently ascertain the extent to which other intellectual property that it may develop or license will be important to it.
 Competition
 The Company faces competition of varying intensity in the sale of its products and competes with and seeks to distinguish itself from its competitors principally on the basis of the uniqueness and quality of its products, price, service, quality, product characteristics and timely delivery. In particular, the Medtainer® competes with metal, glass, paper and other packaging materials as well as plastic and resin packaging materials made through various manufacturing processes. Most of the Company’s existing and potential competitors have greater brand name recognition and their products may enjoy greater market acceptance among its potential customers. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, distribution, service and other resources than does the Company and may be more able to adapt quickly to customers’ changing demands and changes in technology, to enhance existing products, to develop and introduce new products and new production technologies and to respond timely changing market conditions and customer demands. If the Company is not able to compete successfully in the face of its competitors’ advantages, its ability to gain market share or market acceptance for its products could be limited, its revenues and profit margins could suffer, and it might never become profitable.
 Except for the market for containers such as the Medtainer®, in which the Company believes it is a significant competitor, it is an insignificant factor in the highly fragmented markets for its other products and, although it intends to improve its position in these markets, it is unlikely that it will become significant for the foreseeable future.
Regulation
 The Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) regulates the material content of Medtainers®, including the medical-grade polypropylene resin used in their manufacture, pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the “CPSC”) regulates certain aspects of these products pursuant to various federal laws, including the Consumer Product Safety Act and the Poison Prevention Packaging Act. The FDA and the CPSC can require the manufacturer of defective products to repurchase or recall these products and may also impose fines or penalties on the manufacturer. Similar laws exist in some states, cities and other countries in which the Company sells or intends to sell its products. In addition, certain state laws restrict the sale of packaging with certain levels of heavy metals and impose fines and penalties for noncompliance. Although FDA-approved resins and pigments are used in its products that directly contact food and drugs and the Company believes that Medtainer® products are in material compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements (although the Company is not required to submit these or any other products to the FDA or the CPSC for review), the Company is subject to the risk that these products could be found not to be in compliance with these and/or other requirements. A recall of any of these products or any fines and penalties imposed in connection with noncompliance could have a materially adverse effect on the Company.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2019, the Company had, in addition to its 2 executive officers, 9 sales personnel, 3 administrative personnel and 4 print technicians and warehouse personnel. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Company now has, in addition to its 2 executive officers, 1 administrator, 1 print technician and 3 persons working in the Company’s phone room.
