Item 1. Business.
References to “we,” “our,” “us” or the “partnership” used in present tense for periods beginning on or after July 1, 2015, refer to Green Plains Partners LP and its subsidiaries. References to the “MLP predecessor” used in a historical context for periods ended on or before June 30, 2015, refer to BlendStar LLC and its subsidiaries, the partnership’s predecessor for accounting purposes, and the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the ethanol storage and leased railcar assets contributed by Green Plains in connection with the IPO on July 1, 2015. 
Overview
Green Plains Partners is a fee-based Delaware master limited partnership formed by our parent, Green Plains, Inc. on March 2, 2015. On July 1, 2015, we completed our IPO. Our common units are traded under the symbol “GPP” on the Nasdaq. Green Plains Partners provides fuel storage and transportation services by owning, operating, developing and acquiring ethanol and fuel storage facilities, terminals, transportation assets and other related assets and businesses. We were formed by Green Plains, a vertically integrated ethanol producer, to support its marketing and distribution activities as its primary downstream logistics provider.
We generate a substantial portion of our revenues under fee-based commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade for receiving, storing, transferring and transporting ethanol and other fuels, which are supported by minimum volume or take-or-pay capacity commitments. We do not take ownership or receive any payments based on the value of ethanol or other fuels we handle. As a result, we do not have direct price exposure to fluctuating commodity prices.
As of December 31, 2022, our parent owns a 48.8% limited partner interest in us, consisting of 11,586,548 common units, a 2.0% general partner interest and all of our incentive distribution rights. The public owns the remaining 49.2% limited partner interest. The following diagram depicts our simplified organizational structure at December 31, 2022:

Our Assets and Operations
Ethanol Storage. Our ethanol storage assets are the principal method of storing ethanol produced at our parent’s ethanol production plants. Most of our parent’s ethanol production plants are located near major rail lines. Ethanol can be distributed from our storage facilities to bulk terminals via truck, railcar or barge. 
We currently own or lease 27 ethanol storage tanks and approximately 43 acres of land. Our storage tanks are located at or near our parent’s 11 ethanol plants in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Tennessee.
Our ethanol storage tanks have combined storage capacity of 25.1 mmg and aggregate throughput capacity sufficient to support our parent’s annual production capacity of 958 mmgy. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our parent operated its ethanol production facilities at an average utilization rate of approximately 91%. The following table presents additional ethanol production plant details by location:

Plant Location | Initial Operation or Acquisition Date | Major Rail Line Access | Plant Production Capacity (mmgy) | On-Site Ethanol Storage Capacity (thousands of gallons)

Total | | | 958 | | 25,144

Terminal and Distribution Services. We own and operate two fuel terminals in Alabama and Mississippi with combined total storage capacity of approximately 6.7 mmg and access to major rail lines. We also own approximately five acres of land and lease approximately 29 acres of land where our fuel terminals are located. Ethanol and other products are transported to our terminals primarily by rail and shipped from our terminals by truck to third parties, including refiners, blenders and other obligated and non-obligated parties. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the aggregate throughput at these facilities was approximately 198.8 mmg. 
The following table presents additional fuel terminal details by location:

Fuel Terminal Facility Location | Major Rail Line Access | On-Site Storage Capacity (thousands of gallons) | Throughput Capacity (mmgy)
Birmingham, Alabama - Unit Train Terminal | BNSF | 6,542 | | 300
Collins, Mississippi | Canadian National | 180 | | 180
 | | 6,722 | | 480

Transportation and Delivery. Ethanol deliveries to distant markets are shipped using major U.S. rail carriers that can switch cars to other major railroads or barge delivery to national or international ports. Our railcar volumetric capacity is used to transport product primarily from our ethanol storage facilities and third-party production facilities to fuel terminals, including our own, international export terminals and refineries located throughout the United States. As of December 31, 2022, our leased railcar fleet consisted of approximately 2,500 railcars with an aggregate capacity of 75.0 mmg. We expect our railcar volumetric capacity to fluctuate over the normal course of business as our existing railcar leases expire and we enter into or acquire new railcar leases.

We also own and operate a fleet of 19 trucks and tankers that transport ethanol and other products. 
Segments 
Our operations consist of one reportable segment and are conducted solely in the U.S. See Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for financial information about our operations and assets.
Our Relationship with Green Plains
Green Plains is one of the largest ethanol producers in North America with 11 operating dry mill plants, with the capacity to produce approximately 958 million gallons of ethanol per year. Our parent is transitioning from a commodity-processing business to a value-added agricultural technology company creating sustainable, high value feed ingredients, renewable feedstocks for advanced biofuels and dextrose for use in the emerging bio-economy. 
We benefit significantly from our relationship with our parent. Our assets are the principal method of storing and delivering the ethanol our parent produces. Our commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade account for a substantial portion of our revenues. In 2022, our parent completed a modernization and upgrade initiative resulting in improved operational reliability at certain of its facilities, including reductions in natural gas, electricity, and water usage. 
Our parent has a majority interest in us through the ownership of our general partner and a 48.8% limited partner interest, as well as all of our incentive distribution rights. We believe our parent will continue to support the successful execution of our business strategies given its significant ownership in us and the importance of our assets to Green Plains’ operations.
We have entered into several agreements with our parent, which were established in conjunction with the IPO, including: an omnibus agreement; a contribution, conveyance and assumption agreement; an operational services and secondment agreement; and various commercial agreements described below. For all material agreements and subsequent amendments required to be filed, please refer to Item 15 – Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules.
Commercial Agreements with Affiliate
A substantial portion of our revenues and cash flows are derived from our commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade, our primary customer, including a (1) fee-based storage and throughput agreement, (2) Birmingham terminal services agreement, (3) fee-based rail transportation services agreement and (4) various other transportation and terminal services agreements. 
Minimum Volume Commitments. Our storage and throughput agreement and certain terminal services agreements with Green Plains Trade are supported by minimum volume commitments. Our rail transportation services agreement is supported by minimum take-or-pay capacity commitments. Green Plains Trade is required to pay us fees for these minimum commitments regardless of actual throughput volume, capacity used, or the amount of product tendered for transport, which is intended to provide some assurance that we will receive a certain amount of revenue during the terms of these agreements. These arrangements are intended to provide stable and predictable cash flows over time.
Storage and Throughput Agreement. Under our storage and throughput agreement, as amended, Green Plains Trade is obligated to deliver a minimum volume of 217.7 mmg of product per calendar quarter at our storage facilities and pay $0.05312 per gallon on all throughput volume. The rate increased on July 1, 2020 from $0.05 per gallon to $0.05312 per gallon in accordance with the terms of the agreement. If Green Plains Trade fails to meet its minimum volume commitment during any quarter, we charge Green Plains Trade a deficiency payment equal to the deficient volume multiplied by the applicable fee. The deficiency payments are applied as a credit toward volumes delivered by Green Plains Trade in excess of the minimum volume commitment during the following four quarters, after which time any unused credits will expire.
In conjunction with the disposition of the Ord storage and railcar assets on March 22, 2021, the minimum volume commitment decreased from 232.5 mmg per calendar quarter to 217.7 mmg per calendar quarter. In addition, the storage and throughput agreement with Green Plains Trade was extended an additional year to June 30, 2029, as part of this transaction.
The storage and throughput agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless either party provides written notice of its intent to terminate the agreement at least 360 days prior to the end of the remaining primary or renewal term.

Terminal Services Agreement. Under our terminal services agreement for the Birmingham facility, effective through December 31, 2022, Green Plains Trade is obligated to throughput a minimum volume of approximately 8.3 mmg per month of ethanol and other fuels and pay associated throughput fees, as well as fees for ancillary services. The agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year renewal terms unless either party provides written notice of its intent to terminate the agreement at least 90 days prior to the end of the remaining primary or renewal term. Other terminal services agreements with Green Plains Trade also contain minimum volume commitments with various remaining terms. 
Rail Transportation Service Agreement. Under our rail transportation services agreement, Green Plains Trade is obligated to use the partnership to transport ethanol and other fuels from receipt points identified by Green Plains Trade, to nominated delivery points, and pay an average monthly fee of approximately $0.0304 per gallon for all railcar volumetric capacity provided over the remaining life of the agreement. The minimum railcar volumetric capacity commitment we provide to Green Plains Trade for our leased railcar fleet is approximately 75.0 mmg and the weighted average remaining term of all railcar lease agreements is 3.5 years. At December 31, 2022, the remaining term of our rail transportation services agreement with Green Plains Trade was 6.5 years. The rail transportation services agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year renewal terms unless either party provides written notice of its intent to terminate the agreement at least 360 days prior to the end of the remaining primary or renewal term. 
Green Plains Trade is also obligated to use the partnership for logistical operations management and other services related to railcar volumetric capacity provided by Green Plains Trade and pay a monthly fee of approximately $0.0013 per gallon for these services. In addition, Green Plains Trade reimburses us for costs related to: (1) railcar switching and unloading fees; (2) increased costs related to changes in law or governmental regulation related to the specification, operation or maintenance of railcars; (3) demurrage charges, except when the charges are due to our gross negligence or willful misconduct; and (4) fees related to rail transportation services under transportation contracts with third-party common carriers. Green Plains Trade frequently contracts with us for additional railcar volumetric capacity during the normal course of business at comparable margins.
We lease our railcars from third parties under multiple operating lease agreements with various terms. The minimum take-or-pay capacity commitment under the rail transportation services agreement is closely aligned with our existing railcar lease agreements. As a result, when current railcar lease agreements expire, the volumetric capacity provided under the rail transportation services agreement declines accordingly. We enter new lease agreements to replace scheduled capacity reductions under the rail transportation services agreement or provide incremental capacity as requested by Green Plains Trade. We do not speculate on capacity by leasing additional railcars that are not covered by the rail transportation services agreement. 
Trucking Transportation Agreement. Under our trucking transportation agreement, Green Plains Trade pays us to transport ethanol and other fuels by truck from identified receipt points to various delivery points. Green Plains Trade is obligated to pay a monthly trucking transportation services fee equal to the aggregate amount of product volume transported in a calendar month multiplied by the applicable rate for each truck lane, which is defined as a specific route between point of origin and point of destination. Rates for each truck lane are negotiated based on product, location, mileage and other factors, including competitive factors. At December 31, 2022, the remaining term of our trucking transportation agreement was five months. The trucking transportation agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year renewal terms unless either party provides written notice of its intent to terminate the agreement at least 30 days prior to the end of the remaining primary or renewal term. 
Competitive Strengths
We believe that the following competitive strengths position us to successfully execute our business strategies:
Stable and Predictable Cash Flows. A substantial portion of our revenues and cash flows are derived from long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade, including a storage and throughput agreement, rail transportation services agreement, terminal services agreement and other transportation agreements. Our storage and throughput agreement and certain terminal services agreements are supported by minimum volume commitments, and our rail transportation services agreement is supported by minimum take-or-pay capacity commitments. Green Plains Trade is obligated to pay us fees for these minimum commitments regardless of actual throughput or volume, capacity used or the amount of product tendered for transport.

Advantageous Relationship with Our Parent. Our assets are the principal method of storing and delivering the ethanol our parent produces, and the related agreements with Green Plains Trade include minimum volume or take-or-pay capacity commitments. Furthermore, as owner of a 48.8% limited partner interest in us and our general partner interest, as well as all of our incentive distribution rights, our parent directly benefits from our growth, which provides an incentive to pursue projects that directly or indirectly enhance the value of our business and assets. This can be accomplished through organic expansion, accretive acquisitions or the development of downstream distribution services. 
Quality Assets. Our ethanol storage and fuel terminal assets are strategically located in eight states near major rail lines and barge service, which minimizes our exposure to weather-related downtime and transportation congestion and enables access to markets across the United States. Given the nature of our assets, we expect to incur only modest maintenance-related expenses and capital expenditures in the near future. 
Proven Management Team.  Each member of our senior management team is an employee of our parent who also devotes time to manage our business affairs. We believe the commercial, operational and financial expertise of our senior management team allows us to successfully execute our business strategies.
Business Strategy
We intend to further develop and strengthen our business by pursuing the following growth strategies, as capital and opportunities permit: 
Generate Stable, Fee-Based Cash Flows. A substantial portion of our revenues and cash flows are derived from our commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade. Under these agreements, we do not have direct exposure to fluctuating commodity prices. We intend to continue to establish fee-based contracts with our parent and third parties that generate stable and predictable cash flows where available.
Grow Organically. We intend to collaborate primarily with our parent and potentially with other third parties to identify opportunities to develop and construct assets that provide us long-term returns on our investments. 
Acquire Strategic Assets. While not recently acquisitive, our parent has a proven history of identifying, acquiring and integrating assets that are accretive to its business, and to the extent we can, we intend to work with our parent on such opportunities that are eligible for our business model. Subject to capital constraints, we intend to monitor the marketplace for opportunities that complement or diversify our existing operations, including fuel storage and terminal assets in close proximity to our existing asset base.
Development of Downstream Distribution Services. We intend to continue to use our logistical capabilities and expertise to further develop downstream ethanol distribution services that leverage the strategic locations of our ethanol storage and fuel terminal facilities.
Conduct Safe, Reliable and Efficient Operations. We are committed to maintaining safe, reliable and environmentally compliant operations and conduct routine inspections of our assets in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. We seek to improve our operating performance through preventive maintenance, employee training, and safety and development programs. 
Recent Developments
The following is a summary of our significant developments. Additional information about these items can be found elsewhere in this report or in previous reports filed with the SEC.
Amendment to the Rail Transportation Services Agreement
On August 16, 2022, we amended the Rail Transportation Services Agreement with Green Plains Trade to extend the term of the agreement to June 30, 2029, with automatic renewals for successive twelve month terms thereafter until terminated by either party providing 360 days written notice of termination.

Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
On February 11, 2022, the Amended Credit Facility was modified to allow the partnership to repurchase outstanding notes. At that time, the partnership purchased $1.0 million of the outstanding notes from BlackRock and subsequently retired the notes, reducing the term loan balance to $59.0 million. 
Our Competition
Our contractual relationship with Green Plains Trade and the integrated nature of our storage tanks with our parent’s production facilities minimizes potential competition for storage and distribution services provided under our commercial agreements from other third-party operators.
We compete with independent fuel terminal operators and major fuel producers for terminal services based on terminal location, services provided, safety and cost. While there are numerous fuel producers and distributors that own terminal operations similar to ours, they often are not focused on providing services to third parties. Independent operators are often located near key distribution points with cost advantages that provide more efficient services and distribution capabilities into strategic markets with a variety of transportation options. Companies often rely on independent operators when their own storage facilities cannot manage their volumes or throughput adequately due to lack of expertise, market congestion, size constraints, optionality or the nature of the materials being stored.
We believe we are well-positioned to compete effectively in a growing market due to our expertise managing third-party terminal services and logistics. We are a low-cost operator, focused on safety and efficiency, and capable of managing the needs of multiple constituencies across geographical markets. While the competitiveness of our services may be impacted by competition from new entrants, transportation constraints, industry production levels and related storage needs, we believe there are significant barriers to entry that partially mitigate these risks, including significant capital costs, execution risk, complex permitting requirements, development cycle, financial and working capital constraints, expertise and experience, and ability to effectively capture strategic assets or locations.
Seasonality
Our business is directly affected by the supply and demand for ethanol and other fuels in the markets served by our assets. However, the effects of seasonality on our revenues are substantially mitigated through our fee-based commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade, which include minimum volume or take-or-pay capacity commitments.
Major Customer
We are highly dependent on Green Plains Trade and anticipate deriving a substantial portion of our revenues from them in the foreseeable future. Revenues from Green Plains Trade totaled approximately $75.8 million, or 95.0%, $74.2 million, or 94.6%, and $78.5 million, or 94.2% of our total revenues, during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Accordingly, we are indirectly subject to the business risks of Green Plains Trade and any development that materially and adversely affects its operations, financial condition or market reputation. For additional information, please refer to Item 1A - Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry and Risks Related to an Investment in Us.
Regulatory Matters
Government Ethanol Programs and Policies
We are sensitive to governmental policies that impact ethanol, feedstocks for renewable fuels and decarbonization, which in turn may impact the volume of ethanol and other ingredients our parent produces. Legislation and regulatory rule making at the federal, state, and international level can impact our parent and us. Refer to Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Environmental and Other Regulation
Under the omnibus agreement, our parent is required to indemnify us from all known and certain unknown environmental liabilities associated with owning and operating our assets that existed on or before the closing of the IPO. In turn, we agree to indemnify our parent from future environmental liabilities associated with the activities of the partnership. 
Table of Contents

Construction or maintenance of our terminal facilities and storage facilities may impact wetlands, which are regulated by the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers under the Clean Water Act.
Our parent’s ethanol production plants emit carbon dioxide as a by-product of the ethanol production process. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court classified carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act in a case seeking to require the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide in vehicle emissions, which the EPA later addressed in the RFS. While some of our parent’s plants operate as grandfathered at their current authorized capacity under the RFS mandate, expansion above these capacities at grandfathered plants will require a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from a 2005 baseline measurement.
In addition, various states and countries are adopting regulatory schemes similar to what California has adopted. Specifically, CARB adopted LCFS requiring a 10% reduction in average carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel transportation fuels in California from 2010 to 2020. 
See further discussion in Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Employees
We do not have any direct employees. We are managed and operated by the executive officers of our general partner, who are also officers of our parent, and our general partner’s board of directors. Our general partner and its affiliates have approximately 32 full-time equivalent employees under its direct management and supervision supporting our operations.
In addition, we have entered into service agreements with unaffiliated third-parties to provide railcar unloading and terminal services for several of our terminal facilities. Under these service agreements, the third parties are responsible for providing the personnel necessary to perform various railcar unloading and terminal services. The third parties are considered independent contractors and none of their employees or contractors are considered employees, representatives or agents of the partnership.
