Overview
At Limelight we believe in the power of content to change the world. We enable our customers to deliver entertainment, experiences, knowledge, and information where they want to, how they want to, and when they want to. Limelight provides industry-leading content delivery and Edge services to many of the biggest brands in the world.
The services we provide help our customers optimize and deliver digital content to a wide variety of connected devices. This includes a wide range of digital content delivery, online video delivery, cloud security, edge computing, cloud storage, and professional services. In addition, we also derive revenue from relationships with resellers that purchase our services for resale to their end customers.
Limelight’s edge services platform includes a globally distributed, high-performance private network, intelligent software, and support services. We provide advanced features to enable digital workflows for live and on-demand video publishing, online gaming, content distribution, and website and web application acceleration. Limelight services incorporate content and application security, video transformation, distributed storage functionality, and analytics and reporting. These services leverage our high capacity, high speed private global network with distributed computing resources and extensive connectivity to last-mile broadband network providers, ideal for emerging edge compute workloads where rapid response times are needed.
Limelight’s customers include traditional and emerging media companies operating in the television, music, radio, newspaper, magazine, movie, gaming, software, and social media industries, as well as technology companies and various other entities conducting business online. We work with the biggest brands in the world and approach customer relationships as a true partnership with consultative and highly responsive customer service and solutions. 
Segments
We operate in one industry segment, content delivery and related services and we operate in three geographic areas Americas, Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), and Asia Pacific.
Industry Trends
The Internet of the future requires the highest quality digital experiences around the world. Specific trends include:
•Fast growing consumption of online video. Online video viewership continues to accelerate. In our October 2020 State of Online Video consumer report, we found that over-the-top video viewing around the world reached an all-time high of seven hours, 55 minutes a week, a 16 percent increase year over year. And in the first six months of 2020, nearly half (47 percent) of people subscribed to a new streaming service. As consumption of video content continues to shift to Internet-based delivery, it puts an increasing strain on the Internet, placing additional pressure on content distributors to protect the quality of the end-user experience as this increasing segment of traffic competes with other Internet activities, such as browsing websites and downloading digital content.
•Broadcast quality online video. Online video is becoming a primary choice for people to watch video content, whether its via their personal computers, smartphones, tablets, smart televisions, or other connected devices. Consumers expect the same quality experience online as they would have in viewing broadcast television. This puts a significant burden on publishers to not just produce compelling content, but also to deliver it in a way that meets high consumer expectations. To add to the complexity, several large-scale online video providers are streaming video in 4K resolution. In most cases, this requires four times the bandwidth of a traditional high-definition stream. We believe that as more content is made available in 4K resolution (coupled with increasing sales of 4K-ready devices like televisions and computer monitors), more consumers will want to consume the higher-quality content, resulting in increased strain on Internet architecture and infrastructure.
•Growth of digital downloads. Consumers are increasingly making purchases of movies, music, video games, and applications digitally from a variety of retailers and download sizes have increased, especially for video games. For example, releases of popular games have topped 50 gigabytes (GBs) in size. As digital purchases of massive files increase further, we believe this will cause more strain on the Internet’s infrastructure. We believe this will result in additional pressure on organizations and service providers to take steps to avoid congestion, latency, lengthening download times, and increasingly interrupted downloads, all of which we believe would undermine an organization’s ability to deliver the best possible digital experience.
•Live video. Live streaming latency can lead to lost viewers and lost revenue opportunities. The internet was not designed for streaming video. Yet, the future of online video will increasingly include live online interactive experiences. For companies to maximize the opportunity here, sub-second latency will become essential.
Our Services 
We believe our powerful edge services platform combined with our extensive global private IP network, intelligent software, and intense focus on our customers' success differentiate and position Limelight to addresses the trends driving Internet growth and viewers high expectations. Our primary services include the following:
•Content delivery. Limelight operates one of the world’s largest and best-connected private networks with the capacity, coverage, and performance to deliver websites, mobile applications, videos, music, software, games, and APIs quickly, reliably, and securely. Over the past two decades, we built and refined our own delivery system with a private network and dense architecture to provide a better experience that is reliable, secure and offers sub-second low latency. We have developed and optimized our own software stack to deliver maximum performance over any connection type with a fully integrated suite of software services.
•Video delivery. Limelight's live, real-time, on-demand video delivery services and online video platform help organizations manage, publish, syndicate, analyze, and monetize video content. Limelight Real-Time Streaming offers the widest range of low latency online streaming solutions in the industry that allow bidirectional data sharing and make interactive online video experiences possible. To help customers monetize video, Limelight simplifies the process of delivering video to any device and makes it easy to integrate advertising into online video content.
•Edge. Limelight’s comprehensive, flexible, and powerful edge services include a full spectrum of serverless, virtual machine and bare metal with edge compute capabilities. Our edge cloud reduces latencies and enables real time and highly interactive applications by moving processing power from a central point to the network edge and closer to the originators and consumers of data.
•Cloud security. Limelight's cloud security services offer a layered defense against malicious app and website attacks and unauthorized content access. Limelight DDoS Attack Interceptor defends against denial-of-service attacks, and Limelight Web Application Firewall protection guards against attacks that are intended to compromise the back-end services of applications and web sites, in order to deface, disable or steal data. TLS/SSL capabilities encrypt data so it cannot be intercepted in transit, and multiple content security methods are available so only authorized users have access to content. 
•Cloud storage. Limelight’s scalable, redundant, geographically diverse cloud storage has the flexibility and automation to support any content delivery workflow. Limelight simplifies and automates the process of ingesting and managing content while delivering fast performance and high availability. 
Limelight Global Network 
Our extensive private global network makes it possible to position content and applications right next to end users for the most dynamic, real-time interactions. It provides highly available, highly redundant storage, bandwidth, and computing resources in support of our services and solutions. This dense architecture, managed by our proprietary software, automatically responds to network and data center outages and disruptions. All our delivery locations are interconnected via our global network and are connected to multiple Internet backbone and broadband Internet service provider (ISP) networks. This global network has three main features:
•Densely configured, high capacity. Our global private network includes a fiber backbone that connects our delivery Points-of-Presence (PoPs) and enables content to bypass the congested public Internet as it is distributed to the end-user. Each Limelight PoP has a high density of fast servers that enable high cache-hit efficiency, providing faster delivery performance.
•Global scalability. Limelight's global network infrastructure includes more than 100 PoPs around the world. This allows us to cache and deliver content from locations close to where it is being requested. Limelight's network is also directly interconnected with more than 1,000 major ISPs and last-mile network providers, shortening the distance and number of hops that content needs to take.
•Intelligent software to manage the network. We have developed proprietary software that manages our global network. This software manages, among other things, the delivery of digital content, the retrieval of dynamic content, storage and retrieval of objects, activity logging, and information reporting.
Sales, Service, and Marketing 
Our sales and service professionals are located in five offices in the United States with an additional seven office locations in EMEA and Asia Pacific. We target media, high tech, software, gaming, enterprise, and other organizations for which the delivery of digital content is critical to the success of their business. 
Our sales and service organization includes employees in telesales and field sales, professional services, account management, and solutions engineering. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 146 employees in our sales organization. Our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on whether we successfully recruit, train, and retain sufficient sales, technical, and global services personnel, and how well we establish and maintain our distribution and reseller relationships. We believe that the complexity of our services will continue to require highly trained global sales and services personnel. 
To support our sales efforts and promote the Limelight brand, we conduct marketing programs. Our marketing strategies include extensive digital marketing, public relations campaigns, advertisements, events and trade shows, strategic alliances, and on-going customer communication programs. As of December 31, 2020, we had 35 employees in our global marketing organization.
Customers 
Our customers operate in the media, entertainment, gaming, technology and software, enterprise, retail and other sectors. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 527 active customers worldwide, including many of the biggest brands in the world in the fields of online video, live sports, digital music, news media, games, rich media applications, and software delivery. 
During 2020, we had two customers, Amazon and Sony, who represented approximately 36% and 11%, respectively, of our total revenue. During 2019 and 2018, Amazon represented approximately 30%, and 30%, respectively, of our total revenue. In the past, the customers that comprise our top 20 customers have continually changed, and our large customers may not continue to be as significant going forward as they have been in the past. 
From time to time, we have discontinued service to customers for non-payment. Although we did not receive continuing revenue from these former customers, these changes provided for a stronger mix of customers across our base, decreased our days sales outstanding, and allowed us to recoup network capacity to help meet future growth needs. We continue to focus on acquiring and retaining high quality customers across all market segments. 
Competition 
We operate in the digital content delivery market, which is rapidly evolving and highly competitive. We expect this competitive environment to continue. 
The principal methods of competition in this market include scale, performance, service, ease of use, product features, and price. We primarily face competition from Akamai, Lumen Technologies, Amazon, CDNetworks, Fastly, StackPath, and Verizon Digital Media Services.
Product feature competition is intense, requiring continuous investment in innovation. We believe our future success will depend on our ability to continue to innovate and enhance the performance, integration, and functionality of our existing suite of services and of our global network, and on our ability to add additional services and functionality to meet the market’s increasing expectations regarding digital content delivery.
We believe our established edge services platform is the broadest offering available. Our cloud-based software and flexible serverless computing combined with our high-speed private global network infrastructure, solves multiple challenges for customers by removing the need to install, manage, or provision software and hardware to satisfy the requirements for storing and delivering digital content. In addition, the market for digital content delivery can sometimes require multiple 
vendors to provide customers with a complete set of tools and services to manage and deliver all of their digital content to all audiences as part of a global digital presence. We also believe that in those situations where multiple vendors are required, Limelight offers one of the few CDNs with the scale, performance, and reach required to deliver digital content to global audiences.
Research and Development 
Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development, testing, and certification of the software, hardware, and network architecture of our global network and support of our content delivery and other Limelight solutions. As of December 31, 2020, we had 181 employees and employee equivalents in our research and development group. Our research and development personnel are primarily located in Boston, Massachusetts; Lexington, Kentucky; Lviv, Ukraine, and at our headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona. Our engineering efforts support product development across all of our service areas, as well as innovation related to the global network itself. We test our services to ensure scalability in times of peak demand. We use internally developed and third-party software to monitor and to improve the performance of our network in the major Internet consumer markets around the world where we provide services for our customers. Our research and development expenses were $21,680, $22,534, and $24,075 in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, including stock-based compensation expense of $2,589, $1,922, and $2,720 in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. 
Intellectual Property 
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and other intellectual capital. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, domain registrations, and contractual protections.
As of December 31, 2020, we had received 129 patents in the United States, expiring between 2023 and 2036, and we had 1 U.S. patent application pending. We do not have any issued patents in foreign countries. We do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Any patents that may be issued to us may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalidated, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them. Therefore, we cannot predict the exact effect of having a patent with certainty.
As of December 31, 2020, we had received three trademarks in the United States. Our name, Limelight Networks, has been filed for multiple classes in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union (including Benelux and New Zealand), India, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. We have 22 non United States trademarks registered. There is a risk that pending trademark applications may not issue, and that those trademarks that have issued may be challenged by others who believe they have superior rights to the marks.
We generally control access to and use of our proprietary software and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including physical and electronic security, contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners, and domestic and foreign copyright laws.
Human Capital
It is crucial that we continue to attract and retain top talent in order to continue to produce innovative technologies. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to achieve a diverse, inclusive, and safe workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation, benefits, and health and wellness programs, and by programs that build connections between our employees and their communities.
At December 31, 2020, we had 618 employees and employee equivalents. During fiscal 2020, the number of employees increased by 8. Our employees are represented by approximately 13 self-identified nationalities working in approximately 20 locations in 12 different countries around the world. Collectively, we speak approximately 14 different languages. Our global workforce is highly educated, with the substantial majority of our employees working in research and development, operations, and sales. During the year ended December 31, 2020, our voluntary turnover rate was less than 11%, below the technology industry benchmark, which is comprised of certain of our key competitors (Aon, 2020 Salary Increase and Turnover Study — Second Edition, September 2020).
•Diversity and inclusion. We believe that a diverse workforce is critical to our success, and we continue to focus on the hiring, retention, and advancement of women and underrepresented populations. Our recent efforts have been focused in three areas: giving back and supporting the social issues impacting our communities and people, expanding our efforts to recruit and hire world-class diverse talent, and identifying strategic partners to accelerate our inclusion and diversity programs. Our Diversity and Inclusion Employee Resource Group is comprised of employees across the 
company, representing the unique cultures and needs of our employees and who ensure that we commit the time and resources needed to maintain a robust and diverse population. 
•Health, safety, and wellness. The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness programs. These include benefits that provide protection and security so our people can have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that impact their financial well-being, benefits that support our people’s physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors, and benefits that offer choice, where possible, so our people can customize benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees and their families, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This includes having the vast majority of our employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work.
•Compensation and benefits. We provide robust compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by country/region) include annual bonuses, stock awards, an employee stock purchase plan, a 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, and flexible work schedules. In addition to our broad-based equity award programs, we have used targeted equity-based grants with vesting conditions to facilitate retention of personnel, particularly those with critical engineering skills and experience.
•Talent development. We invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to continue to be a leading provider of digital content delivery, online video delivery, cloud security, edge, and cloud storage services. We deliver numerous training opportunities, provide rotational assignment opportunities, have expanded our focus on continuous learning and development, and implemented industry-leading methodologies to manage performance, provide feedback and develop talent. Our talent development programs provide employees with the resources they need to help achieve their career goals, build management skills and lead their organizations. We provide a series of employee workshops around the globe that support professional growth and development. Additionally, our manager and employee forum programs provide an ongoing opportunity for employees to practice and apply learning around conversations aligned with our annual review process. We also have an employee development website that provides quick access to learning resources that are personalized to the individual's development needs.
•Building connections — with each other and our communities. We believe that building connections between our employees, their families, and our communities creates a more meaningful, fulfilling and enjoyable workplace. Our employees are passionate about many causes, so our corporate giving and volunteering programs support and encourage employees by engaging with those causes. During 2020, our Diversity and Inclusion Employee Resource Group selected the following organizations; Black Girls Code, National Action Council for Minorities in Education and Black Lives Matter, to utilize our charitable match program.
