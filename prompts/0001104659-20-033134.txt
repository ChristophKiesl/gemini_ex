Item 1. Business
General
 
SandRidge Permian Trust is a statutory trust formed under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act pursuant to a trust agreement, as amended and restated, by and among SandRidge, as Trustor, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the “Trustee”), and The Corporation Trust Company, as Delaware Trustee (the “Delaware Trustee”) (such amended and restated trust agreement, as amended to date, the “Trust Agreement”) in May 2011. The Trust’s affairs are administered by the Trustee, which maintains its offices at 601 Travis Street, 16th Floor, Houston, Texas 77002. The Trust does not have any employees.
 
Copies of reports filed by the Trust under the Exchange Act are available to Trust unitholders and the public promptly after such materials are filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) by accessing the EDGAR system maintained by the SEC at www.sec.gov/edgar. Certain information concerning the Trust and Trust units as well as a link to the Trust’s filings with the SEC may be obtained at the following website location: www.businesswire.com/cnn/per.htm. The Trust will also provide electronic or paper copies of its filings free of charge upon request to the Trustee.
 
Formation and Structure. The Trust was formed to own Royalty Interests in specified oil and natural gas properties located in Andrews County, Texas (the “Underlying Properties”) conveyed by SandRidge to the Trust pursuant to the terms set forth in conveyancing documents effective April 1, 2011 (the “Conveyances”) concurrent with the initial public offering and sale of 34,500,000 of the Trust’s common units (“Common Units”) in August 2011 (the “Offering”). As consideration for conveyance of the Royalty Interests, the Trust remitted the net proceeds of the offering, along with 4,875,000 Common Units and 13,125,000 unregistered subordinated units of the Trust (“Subordinated Units”), to certain wholly owned subsidiaries of SandRidge. The Common Units and the Subordinated Units are collectively referenced in this Form 10-K as the “Trust units”.
 
The Royalty Interests entitle the Trust to receive (a) 80% of the proceeds (after deducting post-production costs and any applicable taxes) from the sale of oil, natural gas and NGL production attributable to the net revenue interest of SandRidge in 517 oil and natural gas wells drilled and completed as of April 1, 2011 on the Underlying Properties, including 21 wells awaiting Completion at that time (the “Initial Wells”), and (b) 70% of the proceeds (after deducting post-production costs and any applicable taxes) from the sale of oil, natural gas and NGL production attributable to the net revenue interest in 888 development wells drilled and completed by an affiliate of SandRidge pursuant to the terms of a development agreement between the Trust and SandRidge (the “Trust Development Wells”) within an area of mutual interest (“AMI”) designated in the development agreement. The development agreement obligated SandRidge to drill and complete the Trust Development Wells by March 31, 2016. SandRidge fulfilled this obligation in November 2014, and, as a result, the development agreement terminated and the Subordinated Units issued to SandRidge were converted to Common Units in January 2016 pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement.
 
On November 1, 2018, SandRidge sold all of its interests in the Underlying Properties and all Common Units which it owned to Avalon Energy, LLC, a Texas limited liability company. In connection with this transaction (the “Sale Transaction”), Avalon Exploration and Production LLC, an affiliate of Avalon Energy, LLC, assumed all of SandRidge’s obligations under the Trust Agreement and the administrative services agreement between SandRidge and the Trust (as further described below). Avalon Energy, LLC and Avalon Exploration and Production LLC are collectively referred to as “Avalon” in this report. As a part of the Sale Transaction, SandRidge and Avalon entered into a transition services agreement whereby SandRidge provided certain transition services to Avalon, including trust administration services, through April 30, 2019. The transition services agreement has expired. At December 31, 2019, Avalon owned 13,125,000 Common Units, or 25% of all issued and outstanding Trust units.
 
As was the case with SandRidge prior to the Sale Transaction, pursuant to the terms of the Conveyances, Avalon is obligated to act in good faith and as a reasonably prudent operator under the same or similar circumstances as it would if it were acting with respect to its own properties, disregarding the existence of the Royalty Interests as burdens affecting such properties (the “Reasonably Prudent Operator Standard”). The Conveyances generally permit Avalon to sell all or any part of its interest in the Underlying Properties, if the Underlying Properties are sold subject to and burdened by the Royalty Interests.
 
The Trust is passive in nature and neither the Trust nor the Trustee has any control over, or responsibility for, any operating or capital costs related to the Underlying Properties. The business and affairs of the Trust are administered by the Trustee. However, the Trustee has no authority over or responsibility for, and no involvement with, any aspect of the oil and natural gas operations or other activities with respect to the Underlying Properties. The Trust Agreement generally limits the Trust’s business activities to owning the Royalty Interests and certain activities reasonably related thereto, including activities required or permitted by the terms of the Conveyances related to the Royalty Interests.

The Trust will dissolve and begin to liquidate on March 31, 2031 (the “Termination Date”), unless sooner dissolved pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement as described below and will soon thereafter wind up its affairs and terminate. At the Termination Date, 50% of the Royalty Interests will revert automatically to Avalon. The remaining 50% of the Royalty Interests will be sold at that time, and the net proceeds of the sale, as well as any remaining Trust cash reserves, will be distributed to the unitholders on a pro rata basis, subject to Avalon's right of first refusal to purchase the Royalty Interests retained by the Trust at the Termination Date. The Trust may also dissolve should one of the following events occur prior to the Termination Date: (a) the Trust sells all of the Royalty Interests; (b) cash available for distribution for any four consecutive quarters, on a cumulative basis, is less than $5.0 million; (c) the Trust unitholders approve an earlier dissolution of the Trust; or (d) the Trust is judicially dissolved pursuant to the Delaware Statutory Trust Act. In the case of any of the foregoing, the Trustee would then sell all of the Trust’s assets (subject to Avalon’s right of first refusal to purchase the Royalty Interests retained by the Trust as of the date of such event), either by private sale or public auction, and distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the Trust unitholders after payment, or reasonable provision for payment, of all Trust liabilities.
 
The Trust is highly dependent on Avalon for multiple services, including: (a) the operation of the Underlying Properties and wells located thereon; (b) the marketing and sale of hydrocarbon production from the wells; (c) the remittance of net proceeds from the sale of production from wells burdened by the Royalty Interests to the Trust; (d) administrative services such as accounting, tax preparation, bookkeeping and informational services performed on behalf of the Trust; and (e) the preparation and filing of reports the Trust is or may be required to prepare and/or file in accordance with applicable tax and securities laws, exchange listing rules and other requirements. The ability to operate the Underlying Properties depends on Avalon’s future financial condition and economic performance, access to capital, and other factors, many of which are out of Avalon’s control. If the reduced demand for crude oil in the global market resulting from the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic and the recent reduction in the benchmark price of crude oil persist for the near term or longer, such factor are likely to have a negative impact on Avalon’s financial condition. This negative impact could affect Avalon’s ability to operate the wells and provide services to the Trust.
 
Income Tax Considerations. The Trust is treated as a partnership for federal and applicable state income tax purposes, and Trust unitholders are treated as partners in that partnership for such purposes. For United States (“U.S.”) federal income tax purposes, a partnership is not a taxable entity and incurs no U.S. federal income tax liability. With respect to state taxation, a partnership typically is treated in the same manner as it is for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Each partner is required to take into account his or her share of items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of the partnership in computing his or her federal income tax liability, regardless of whether cash distributions are made to him or her by the partnership. Distributions by a partnership to a partner generally are not taxable to the partner (but instead reduce tax basis but not below zero) unless the amount of cash distributed to such partner is in excess of the partner’s adjusted tax basis in his or her partnership interest. To date, the Trust has distributed an amount of cash to Trust unitholders in excess of their cash contributions made at the time of the initial public offering of Common Units.
 
The Trust’s activities occur solely in Texas and, as a result, the Trust is deemed to have “nexus” under the Texas franchise tax laws. Therefore, the Trust is required to pay Texas franchise tax each year at a maximum effective rate (subject to changes in the statutory rate) of 0.1655% of all gross income.
 
Agreements with Avalon
 
In conjunction with the conveyance of the Royalty Interests to the Trust, the Trust entered into the following agreements with SandRidge and/or one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, which agreements were subsequently assigned to Avalon in connection with the Sale Transaction:
 
Administrative Services Agreement. The Trust is a party to an administrative services agreement with Avalon, as assignee of SandRidge (the “Administrative Services Agreement”), that obligates the Trust to pay Avalon an annual administrative services fee in the amount of $300,000, payable quarterly, for accounting, tax preparation, bookkeeping and informational services to be performed by Avalon on behalf of the Trust. Avalon is also entitled to receive reimbursement for its out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the provision of any of the services provided under this agreement. In connection with the Sale Transaction, Avalon assumed the responsibility to provide such services to the Trust under the terms of the Administrative Services Agreement effective November 1, 2018.
 
The Administrative Services Agreement will terminate on the earliest to occur of: (a) the date the Trust shall have dissolved and commenced winding up in accordance with the Trust Agreement; (b) the date that all of the Royalty Interests have been terminated or are no longer held by the Trust; (c) pertaining to administrative services being provided by Avalon, the date that either Avalon or the Trustee may designate by delivering written notice no less than 90 days prior to such date, provided that Avalon cannot terminate the agreement except in connection with the transfer of some or all of the Underlying Properties and the transferee thereof assuming responsibility to perform the services in place of Avalon; and (d) a date mutually agreed by Avalon and the Trustee.

Registration Rights Agreement. The Trust entered into a registration rights agreement for the benefit of SandRidge and certain of its affiliates and transferees, pursuant to which the Trust agreed to register the offering of unregistered Trust units, now held by Avalon, upon request. Upon the closing of the Sale Transaction, Avalon assumed the rights and obligations of SandRidge under the registration rights agreement. Specifically, the Trust agreed:

• | to use its reasonable best efforts to file a registration statement, including, if so requested, a shelf registration statement, with the SEC within 45 days of receipt of a notice requesting the filing of a registration statement from Avalon;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the registration statement or shelf registration statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after the filing thereof; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | to continuously maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement under the Securities Act for 90 days (or continuously if a shelf registration statement is requested) after the effectiveness thereof or until the Trust units covered by the registration statement have been sold pursuant to such registration statement or until all registrable Trust units:
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | have been sold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act if the transferee thereof does not receive “restricted securities”;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | have been sold in a private transaction in which the transferor’s rights under the registration rights agreement are not assigned to the transferee of the Trust units; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | become eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144 (or any similar rule then in effect under the Securities Act).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The holders will have the right to require the Trust to file no more than five registration statements in aggregate, one of which has been filed to date on behalf of SandRidge. The Trust does not bear any expenses associated with such transactions.
 
Trust Agreement
 
The Trust Agreement provides that the Trust’s business activities are generally limited to owning the Royalty Interests and administrative activities related thereto as set forth in the Trust Agreement, including activities required or permitted by the terms of the Conveyances related to the Royalty Interests. The Trust is not permitted to acquire other oil and natural gas properties or royalty interests and is not able to issue any additional Trust units.
 
The beneficial interest in the Trust is divided into 52,500,000 Trust units, which now consist solely of Common Units. Each Trust unit represents an equal undivided beneficial interest in the property of the Trust.
 
Amendment of the Trust Agreement generally requires the vote of holders of (i) a majority of the Trust units (excluding Trust units owned by Avalon) and (ii) a majority of the Trust units (including Trust units owned by Avalon), in each case voting in person or by proxy at a meeting of such unitholders at which a quorum is present. At any time that Avalon owns less than 10% of the total Trust units outstanding, however, the standard for approval will be the vote of the holders of a majority of the Trust units, including Trust units owned by Avalon, voting in person or by proxy at a meeting of the unitholders at which a quorum is present. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be deemed to be a vote cast. However, no amendment may:
 

• | increase the power of the Trustee to engage in business or investment activities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | alter the rights of the Trust unitholders as among themselves; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | permit the Trustee to distribute the Royalty Interests in kind.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 
Amendments to the Trust Agreement’s provisions addressing the following matters may not be made without Avalon’s consent:
 

• | dispositions of the Trust’s assets;
--+------------------------------------


• | indemnification of the Trustee;
--+--------------------------------


• | reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses of Avalon when acting as the Trust’s agent;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | termination of the Trust; and
--+------------------------------


• | amendments of the Trust Agreement.
--+-----------------------------------

 
Certain amendments to the Trust Agreement do not require the vote of the Trust unitholders. See “Permitted Amendments” below.

The business and affairs of the Trust are managed by the Trustee. The Trustee has no ability to manage or influence the operations of the Underlying Properties. Avalon operates the Underlying Properties, but has no ability to manage or influence the management of the Trust, except through its limited voting rights as a holder of Trust units.
 
Duties and Powers of the Trustee. The duties and powers of the Trustee are specified in the Trust Agreement and by the laws of the State of Delaware, except as modified by the Trust Agreement. The Trust Agreement provides that the Trustee does not have any duties or liabilities, including fiduciary duties, except as expressly set forth in the Trust Agreement, and the duties and liabilities of the Trustee as set forth in the Trust Agreement replace any other duties and liabilities, including fiduciary duties, to which the Trustee might otherwise be subject.
 
The Trustee’s principal duties consist of:
 

• | collecting cash proceeds attributable to the Royalty Interests;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | paying expenses, charges and obligations of the Trust from the Trust’s assets;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | making cash distributions to the Trust unitholders in accordance with the Trust Agreement;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | causing to be prepared and distributed a Schedule K-1 for each Trust unitholder and preparing and filing tax returns on behalf of the Trust; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | causing to be prepared and filed reports required to be filed under the Exchange Act and under the rules of any securities exchange or quotation system on which the Trust units are listed or admitted to trading.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Avalon provides, and SandRidge provided prior to the Sale Transaction, administrative and other services to the Trust in fulfillment of certain of the foregoing duties, pursuant to the terms of the Administrative Services Agreement. SandRidge performed these services on behalf of, and in conjunction with, Avalon pursuant to the terms of the transition services agreement, which terminated on April 30, 2019.
 
Except as set forth below, cash held by the Trustee as a reserve against future liabilities must be invested in:
 

• | interest-bearing obligations of the United States government;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | money market funds that invest only in United States government securities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | repurchase agreements secured by interest-bearing obligations of the United States government; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | bank certificates of deposit.
--+------------------------------

 
Alternatively, cash held for distribution at the next distribution date may be held in a non-interest-bearing account.
 
The Trust may not acquire any asset except the Royalty Interests and cash and temporary cash investments, and it may not engage in any investment activity except investing cash on hand.
 
The Trust Agreement provides that the Trustee will not make business decisions affecting the assets of the Trust. However, the Trustee may:
 

• | prosecute or defend, and settle, claims of or against the Trust or its agents;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | retain professionals and other third parties to provide services to the Trust;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | charge for its services as Trustee;
--+------------------------------------


• | retain funds to pay for future expenses and deposit them with one or more banks or financial institutions (which may include the Trustee to the extent permitted by law);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | lend funds at commercial rates to the Trust to pay the Trust’s expenses; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | seek reimbursement from the Trust for its out-of-pocket expenses.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In carrying out its powers and performing its duties to Trust unitholders, the Trustee may act directly or in its discretion (at the expense of the Trust) through agents pursuant to agreements entered into with any of them, and the Trustee will be liable to the Trust unitholders only for its own willful misconduct, acts or omissions made in bad faith, gross negligence, or taxes, fees or other charges based on any fees, commissions or compensation received by it in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by the Trust Agreement. The Trustee will not be liable for any act or omission of its agents unless the Trustee acted with willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence in its selection and retention of such agents. The Trustee and its affiliates, as well as each of its agents (including Avalon when acting in its capacity as an agent), will be indemnified and held harmless by, and receive reimbursement from, the Trust against and from any liability or cost that it incurs individually in the administration of the Trust, except in cases of willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence. The Trustee has a lien on the assets of the Trust as security for this indemnification and its compensation earned as Trustee. Trust unitholders will not be liable to the Trustee for any indemnification. The Trustee ensures that all contractual liabilities of the Trust are limited to the assets of the Trust. The Trustee has not loaned and does not intend to lend funds to the Trust.

Merger or Consolidation of Trust. The Trust may merge or consolidate with or into, or convert into, one or more limited partnerships, general partnerships, corporations, business trusts, limited liability companies, or associations or unincorporated businesses if such transaction is agreed to by the Trustee and approved by the vote of the holders of (i) a majority of the Trust units (excluding Trust units owned by Avalon) and (ii) a majority of the Trust units (including Trust units owned by Avalon), in each case voting in person or by proxy at a meeting of such holders at which a quorum is present and such transaction is permitted under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act and any other applicable law. At any time that Avalon owns less than 10% of the total Trust units outstanding, however, the standard for approval will be the vote of the holders of a majority of the Trust units, including Trust units owned by Avalon, voting in person or by proxy at a meeting of such holders at which a quorum is present.
 
Trustee’s Power to Sell Royalty Interests. The Trustee may sell the Royalty Interests under any of the following circumstances:
 

• | the sale is requested by Avalon in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the sale is approved by the vote of the holders of (i) a majority of the Trust units (excluding Trust units owned by Avalon) and (ii) a majority of the Trust units (including Trust units owned by Avalon), in each case voting in person or by proxy at a meeting of such holders at which a quorum is present; except that at any time that Avalon owns less than 10% of the total Trust units outstanding, the standard for approval will be the vote of the holders of a majority of the Trust units, including Trust units owned by Avalon, voting in person or by proxy at a meeting of such holders at which a quorum is present.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Upon dissolution of the Trust, the Trustee must sell those Royalty Interests that do not revert automatically to Avalon pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement. No Trust unitholder approval is required in this event.
 
The Trustee will distribute the net proceeds from any sale of the Royalty Interests and other assets to the Trust unitholders after payment or reasonable provision for payment of all liabilities of the Trust, including any amounts owed to its agents (including Avalon acting in such capacity).
 
Permitted Amendments. The Trustee may amend or supplement the Trust Agreement, the conveyances, the Administrative Services Agreement, or the registration rights agreement, without the approval of the Trust unitholders, to cure ambiguities, to correct or supplement defective or inconsistent provisions, to grant any benefit to all Trust unitholders, to evidence or implement any changes required by applicable law, or to change the name of the Trust; provided, however, that any such supplement or amendment does not adversely affect the interests of the Trust unitholders. Furthermore, the Trustee, acting alone, may amend the Administrative Services Agreement without the approval of Trust unitholders if such amendment would not increase the cost or expense of the Trust or create an adverse economic impact on the Trust unitholders.
 
All other permitted amendments to the Trust Agreement and other agreements listed above may only be made by the vote of the holders of (i) a majority of the Trust units (excluding Trust units owned by Avalon) and (ii) a majority of the Trust units (including Trust units owned by Avalon), in each case voting in person or by proxy at a meeting of such holders at which a quorum is present; except that at any time that Avalon owns less than 10% of the total Trust units outstanding, the standard for approval will be the vote of the holders of a majority of the Trust units, including Trust units owned by Avalon, voting in person or by proxy at a meeting of such holders at which a quorum is present. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be deemed to be a vote cast.
 
Miscellaneous. The Trustee may consult with legal counsel (which may include legal counsel to Avalon), accountants, tax advisors, geologists and engineers and other parties the Trustee believes to be qualified as experts on the matters for which advice is sought. The Trustee will be protected for any action it takes in good faith reliance upon the opinion of an expert.
 
The Delaware Trustee and the Trustee may resign at any time or be removed with or without cause at any time by the vote of the holders of a majority of the Trust units (excluding Trust units owned by Avalon), voting in person or by proxy at a meeting of such holders at which a quorum is present; except that at any time that Avalon owns less than 10% of the outstanding Trust units, the standard for approval will be the vote of the holders of a majority of the Trust units, including Trust units owned by Avalon, voting in person or by proxy at a meeting of such holders at which a quorum is present. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be deemed to be a vote cast. Any successor must be a bank or trust company meeting certain requirements including having combined capital, surplus and undivided profits of at least $20 million, in the case of the Delaware Trustee, and $100 million, in the case of the Trustee.

Distributions
 
The Trustee makes quarterly cash distributions of substantially all of its cash receipts, after deducting amounts for the Trust’s administrative expenses, property taxes and Texas franchise taxes, and cash reserves withheld by the Trustee, on or about the 60th day following the completion of each quarter. Each distribution covers production for a three-month period. The amount of Trust revenues and cash distributions to Trust unitholders depends on:

• | oil, natural gas and NGL prices received;
--+------------------------------------------


• | volume of oil, natural gas and NGL produced and sold;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | post-production costs (which includes internal costs and third person costs incurred by Avalon) and any applicable taxes; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Trust’s general and administrative expenses.
--+-------------------------------------------------

 
The amount of the quarterly distributions will fluctuate from quarter to quarter, depending on the factors discussed above. There is no minimum required distribution. See Note 4 to the financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of Trust distributions.
 
If at any time the Trust’s cash on hand (including available cash reserves) is not sufficient to pay the Trust’s ordinary course administrative expenses as they become due, the Trust may borrow funds from the Trustee or other lenders, including Avalon, to pay such expenses. The Trustee has not loaned and does not intend to lend funds to the Trust. If such funds are borrowed, no further distributions will be made to Trust unitholders (except in respect of any previously determined quarterly distribution amount) until the borrowed funds have been repaid.
 
The Trust Agreement provides that, if at any time the Trust’s cash on hand (including available cash reserves) is not sufficient to pay the Trust’s ordinary course administrative expenses as they become due, Avalon (as assignee of SandRidge) will, at the Trustee’s request, loan funds to the Trust necessary to pay such expenses. Any such loan will be on an unsecured basis, and the terms of such loan will be substantially the same as those which would be obtained in an arms’ length transaction between Avalon and an unaffiliated third party. If Avalon provides such funds to the Trust, Avalon may permit the Trust to make distributions prior to Avalon being repaid for such loan. In addition, Avalon would become a creditor of the Trust and its interest as a creditor could conflict with the interests of other Trust unitholders. The Trust did not borrow funds from SandRidge, and to date, the Trust has not borrowed funds from Avalon.
 
Properties
 
As of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Trust’s properties consisted of Royalty Interests in (a) the Initial Wells and (b) 856 additional wells (equivalent to 888 Trust Development Wells under the development agreement) that were drilled and perforated for Completion between April 1, 2011 and December 31, 2014. SandRidge was credited for having drilled one full Trust Development Well if a well was drilled and perforated for Completion to the Grayburg/San Andres formation and SandRidge’s net revenue interest in the well was equal to 69.3%. For wells in which SandRidge had a net revenue interest equal to or greater than 69.3%, SandRidge received proportionate credit for such well. The wells are located on properties situated in the greater Fuhrman-Mascho field, a field in Andrews County, Texas, that produces primarily oil from the Grayburg/San Andres formation in the Permian Basin.
 
Proved Reserves. The following estimates of net proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves are based on reserve reports prepared by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (“Netherland Sewell”), independent petroleum engineers. The PV-10 and Standardized Measure shown in the table below are not intended to represent the current value of estimated oil, natural gas and NGL reserves attributable to the Royalty Interests as of the dates shown. The reserve reports as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were based on the average price during the 12-month periods ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, using first-day-of-the-month prices for each month. Refer to “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this report and “Trustee’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of this report in evaluating the reserve information presented below.
 
Avalon provides, and SandRidge provided prior to the Sale Transaction, certain services respecting the estimation of net proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves to the Trust pursuant to the terms of the Administrative Services Agreement. SandRidge performed these services on behalf of, and in conjunction with, Avalon pursuant to the terms of the transition services agreement, until April 30, 2019 (the date on which such agreement terminated). Consistent with past practice, the process begins with an Avalon staff reservoir engineer collecting and verifying all pertinent data, including but not limited to well test data, production data, historical pricing, cost information, property ownership interests, reservoir data, and geosciences data. This data was reviewed by various levels of Avalon management for accuracy, before consultation with the independent petroleum engineers. Members of Avalon management, including its staff reservoir engineer, regularly consulted with the independent petroleum engineers during the reserve estimation process to review properties, assumptions, and any new data available. The internal reserve estimates completed and methodologies used by Avalon were compared to the independent petroleum engineers’ estimates and conclusions before the reserve estimates were included in the independent petroleum engineers’ reports. Additionally, members of Avalon’s senior management reviewed and approved the reserve reports contained herein.

Internal Controls. Avalon’s Vice President - Petroleum Engineering is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the Trust’s reserve estimates on behalf of the Trustee. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Civil Engineering with over 40 years of practical industry experience, including estimating and evaluating reserve information. In addition, he has been a certified professional engineer in the State of Texas since July 1983 and a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers since 1975.
 
In order to ensure the reliability of reserves estimates, Avalon’s internal controls observed within the reserve estimation process included:
 

• | No employee’s compensation is tied to the amount of reserves booked.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reserves estimates are prepared by experienced reservoir engineers or under their direct supervision.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Vice President - Petroleum Engineering reports directly to Avalon’s President.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Avalon management follows comprehensive SEC-compliant internal policies to determine and report proved reserves including:
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | confirming that reserve estimates include all applicable properties and are based upon proper working and net revenue interests;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reviewing and using in the estimation process data provided by other departments within Avalon, such as Accounting; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | comparing and reconciling internally generated reserve estimates to those prepared by third parties.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The independent petroleum engineers estimated all of the proved reserve information in these reserve reports in accordance with the definitions and guidelines of the SEC and in conformity with the Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive Activities-Oil and Gas. Neither Netherland Sewell nor any officer or employee of Avalon owns an interest in any of the Underlying Properties, nor are they employed on a contingent basis. The qualifications of Netherland Sewell’s technical personnel primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the Trust’s reserves estimates included in this report include the following:
 

• | practicing consulting petroleum engineering since 2013 and over 14 years of prior industry experience;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | licensed professional engineers in the State of Texas; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | a Bachelor of Science Degree in Chemical Engineering.
--+------------------------------------------------------

 
These qualifications meet or exceed the Society of Petroleum Engineers’ standard requirements to be a professionally qualified Reserve Estimator and Auditor.
 
Reporting of Natural Gas Liquids. Natural gas liquids, or NGL, are produced as a result of the processing of a portion of the Trust’s natural gas production stream. At December 31, 2019, NGL constituted approximately 9% of the Trust’s total proved reserves on a barrel equivalent basis and represented volumes to be produced from properties where contracts are in place for the extraction and separate sale of NGL. NGL are products sold by the gallon. In reporting proved reserves and production of NGL, production and reserves have been included in barrels. The extraction of NGL in the processing of natural gas reduces the volume of natural gas available for sale. All production information related to natural gas is reported net of the effect of any reduction in natural gas volumes resulting from the processing and extraction of NGL.

(4) | PV-10 is the present value of estimated future net revenue to be generated from the production of proved reserves, discounted at 10% per annum to reflect timing of future cash flows and calculated without deducting future income taxes. PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and generally differs from standardized measure of discounted net cash flows, or Standardized Measure, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, because it does not include the effects of income taxes on future net revenues. Neither PV-10 nor Standardized Measure are intended to represent an estimate of fair market value of the Royalty Interests. PV-10 is used by the industry as an arbitrary reserve asset value measure to compare the relative size and value of the proved reserves held by companies without regard to the specific tax characteristics of such entities.

Proved reserves are those quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL that, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations, prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for estimation. To be classified as proved reserves, the project to extract the oil or natural gas must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable period of time.
 
The area of a reservoir considered proved includes (i) the area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and (ii) adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with the identified area and to contain economically producible oil or natural gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data. In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish a lower contact with reasonable certainty.
 
Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.
 
Reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (such as fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when (i) successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir, or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based and (ii) the project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.
 
Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which hydrocarbons can be economically produced from a known reservoir. In determining the amount of proved reserves, the price used must be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the reserve report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.
 
Proved Undeveloped Reserves.
 
SandRidge was obligated to drill, or cause to be drilled, the Trust Development Wells by March 31, 2016. SandRidge fulfilled its drilling obligation to the Trust in November 2014, and neither SandRidge nor Avalon has any future drilling obligations to the Trust. Accordingly, the Trust has not had any proved undeveloped reserves since December 31, 2014 and will not have any proved undeveloped reserves in the future.

Productive Wells
 
The following table sets forth as of December 31, 2019 the number of productive wells burdened by the Royalty Interests. Productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of producing. Gross wells are the total number of producing wells burdened by the Royalty Interests and net wells are the sum of the Trust’s fractional Royalty Interests owned in gross wells.

Developed and Undeveloped Acreage
 
As of December 2014, SandRidge had drilled and perforated for completion 888 equivalent Trust Development Wells, thus fulfilling its drilling obligation. Accordingly, the AMI terminated effective December 2014, and no undeveloped acreage constituting a part of the Underlying Properties exists.
Drilling Activity
 
There were no wells drilled or completed during 2019 or 2018, and there were no wells to be drilled or awaiting completion at December 31, 2019 or 2018.

Marketing and Customers
 
Avalon has the responsibility to market, or cause to be marketed, the oil, natural gas and NGL production attributable to the Underlying Properties and is not permitted to charge any marketing fees when determining the net proceeds upon which the royalty payments are calculated, except for marketing fees and costs of non-affiliates. SandRidge performed these services on behalf of, and in conjunction with, Avalon during the first four months of 2019 pursuant to the terms of the transition services agreement, which terminated on April 30, 2019. As a result, the net proceeds to the Trust from the sales of oil, natural gas and NGL production from the Underlying Properties for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 are determined based on the same price (net of post-production costs) that Avalon received for oil, natural gas and NGL production attributable to its interest in the Underlying Properties.
 
During each of 2019 and 2018, two customers individually accounted for more than 10% of total revenue attributable to the Royalty Interests. The number of readily available purchasers for the production from the Underlying Properties reduces the risk that the loss of a single customer in the area in which Avalon sells oil, natural gas and NGL production from the Underlying Properties would materially affect the Trust’s revenue. See the table below for additional information on Avalon’s major customers for production from the Underlying Properties from January 1, 2018 to October 31, 2019.
 

 | Sales | | % of Revenue
-------------------------+-------+----------------+-------------
 | | (in thousands) | | | 
2019 | | | | | 
Enterprise Crude Oil LLC | $ | 17,063 | | 81.2 | %
ConocoPhillips Company | $ | 3,951 | | 18.8 | %
2018 | | | | | 
Enterprise Crude Oil LLC | $ | 22,685 | | 76.0 | %
ConocoPhillips Company | $ | 4,917 | | 16.5 | %

 
In October 2019, Avalon entered into a crude oil purchasing agreement with Ace Gathering Inc., a Texas corporation doing business as Ace Energy Solutions (“ACE”). Pursuant to the terms of the contract, Avalon is required to deliver all crude oil produced from wells it operates, including the Underlying Properties, beginning November 1, 2019. As a result, all production from the Underlying Properties is committed to ACE under the contract through December 31, 2021. The price for each barrel of crude oil delivered under the contract is NYMEX West Texas Intermediate averaged over the month of delivery, subject to certain adjustments as set forth in the contract. Avalon entered into this contract, together with an agreement whereby Avalon can purchase condensate from ACE to use in its well workover program, in order to maximize the price of production, as well as the transparency of pricing, from the Underlying Properties and other properties operated by Avalon. Transportation of crude oil sold by Avalon will continue to utilize existing pipeline systems and suppliers, including Enterprise Crude Oil LLC and ConocoPhillips Company.
 
Title to Properties
 
The Underlying Properties are subject to certain burdens that are described in more detail below. To the extent that these burdens and obligations affect the rights of Avalon in production and the value of production from the Underlying Properties, they have been taken into account in calculating the Trust’s interest and in estimating the size and value of the reserves attributable to the Royalty Interests. The Underlying Properties are typically subject, in one degree or another, to one or more of the following:

• | royalties and other burdens, express and implied, under oil and natural gas leases;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | production payments and similar interests and other burdens created by Avalon’s predecessors in title;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a variety of contractual obligations arising under operating agreements, farm-out agreements, production sales contracts and other agreements that may affect the Underlying Properties or their titles;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | liens that arise in the normal course of operations, such as those for unpaid taxes, statutory liens securing unpaid suppliers and contractors and contractual liens under operating agreements that are not yet delinquent or, if delinquent, are being contested in good faith;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pooling, unitization and communitization agreements, declarations and orders;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | easements, restrictions, rights-of-way and other matters that commonly affect real property;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | conventional rights of reassignment that obligate Avalon to reassign all or part of a property to a third party if Avalon intends to release or abandon such property; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | rights reserved to or vested in the appropriate governmental agency or authority to control or regulate the Underlying Properties.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Avalon believes that its title to the Underlying Properties and the Trust’s title to the Royalty Interests are good and defensible in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry, subject to such exceptions as are not so material as to detract substantially from the use or value of such properties or Royalty Interests.
 
Competition and Markets
 
The production and sale of oil, natural gas and NGL is highly competitive. Competitors in the Permian Basin include major oil and gas companies, independent oil and gas companies, and individual producers and operators. There are numerous producers in the Permian Basin, and competitive position in this area is affected by price, contract terms and quality of service.
 
Oil, natural gas and NGL compete with other forms of energy available to customers, primarily based on price. These alternate forms of energy include electricity, coal and fuel oils. Changes in the availability or price of oil, natural gas or other forms of energy, as well as business conditions, conservation, legislation, regulations and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for oil, natural gas and NGL.
 
Future price fluctuations for oil, natural gas and NGL will directly impact Trust distributions, estimates of reserves attributable to the Royalty Interests and estimated and actual future net revenues to the Trust. Due to the many uncertainties that affect the supply and demand for oil, natural gas and NGL, reliable predictions of future oil, natural gas and NGL supply and demand, future product prices or the effect of future product prices on Trust distributions cannot be made. However, lower production volumes and product prices will adversely affect Trust distributions.
 
Seasonal Nature of Business
 
Generally, demand for oil, natural gas and NGL decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months. Certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer, which can lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. Seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit producing activities and other oil and natural gas operations. These seasonal anomalies can increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months, which could lead to shortages and increased costs or delay operations.
Insurance
 
Avalon operates all of the wells burdened by the Royalty Interests. Avalon maintains insurance, in accordance with industry practice, against some, but not all, of the operating risks to which its operating affiliate is exposed. Generally, insurance policies include coverage for general liability (including sudden and accidental pollution), physical damage to certain oil and natural gas properties, auto liability, worker’s compensation and employer’s liability, among other things.
 
Avalon maintains general liability insurance coverage up to $1 million per occurrence and $2 million aggregate policy limit, which includes (i) completed operations coverage and (ii) sudden and accidental environmental liability coverage for the effects of pollution on third parties, arising from operations. The general liability insurance policy contains limits subject to certain customary exclusions and limitations, as well as deductibles that must be met prior to recovery. In addition, Avalon maintains $25 million in excess liability coverage, which is in addition to and triggered if the general liability per occurrence limit is reached, and may be subject to a deductible that must be met prior to recovery. Avalon also maintains worker’s compensation coverage in accordance with Texas statutory requirements and employee liability coverage of $1 million by accident or by disease.
 
All of Avalon’s third-party contractors are required to sign master services agreements in which they agree (a) to indemnify Avalon for injuries and deaths of the service provider’s employees as well as contractors and subcontractors hired by the service provider and (b) name Avalon as an additional insured on their insurance policies. Similarly, Avalon generally agrees to indemnify each third-party contractor against claims made by employees of Avalon and Avalon’s other contractors. Additionally, each party generally is responsible for damage to its own property.
 
The third-party contractors that perform hydraulic fracturing operations sign the master services agreements containing the indemnification provisions noted above. Currently there are no insurance policies in effect intended to provide coverage for losses solely related to hydraulic fracturing operations as none have been performed by Avalon on the Underlying Properties or other properties owned by Avalon.
 
Avalon annually re-evaluates the purchase of insurance, coverage limits and deductibles. Future insurance coverage for the oil and natural gas industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are economically acceptable. No assurance can be given that insurance may be maintained in the future at rates considered reasonable. Self-insurance or only catastrophic coverage may be elected for certain risks in the future.
 
12

 

The Trust does not maintain any insurance policies or coverage against any of the risks of conducting oil and gas exploration and production or related activities.
 
Regulation
 
Oil and Natural Gas Regulations. The oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state, local and regional authorities, as well as Native American tribes. Legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, and Native American tribes are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for noncompliance. Although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business and, consequently, affects its profitability, these burdens generally do not affect SandRidge or Avalon any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types, quantities and locations of production.
 
The availability, terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil, natural gas and NGL. The interstate transportation and sale for resale of oil, natural gas and NGL is subject to federal regulation, including regulation of the terms, conditions and rates for interstate transportation, storage and various other matters, primarily by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”). Federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation. FERC’s regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas.
 
However, sales of oil, natural gas and NGL produced from the Underlying Properties are not currently regulated and are transacted at market prices. Although oil, natural gas and NGL prices are currently unregulated, Congress historically has been active in the area of oil and natural gas regulation. Whether new legislation to regulate oil, natural gas and NGL prices might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures, and what effect, if any, the proposals might have on the operations of the Underlying Properties cannot be predicted.
 
Production. Operations are subject to various types of regulation at federal, state and local levels. These types of regulation include reports concerning operations. Most states, and some counties, municipalities and Native American tribal areas also regulate one or more of the following activities: the rates of production, or “allowables”, the use of surface or subsurface waters, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, the plugging and abandoning of wells, and the notice to surface owners and other third parties.
 
State laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties. Some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In some instances, forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce Avalon’s interest in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil, natural gas and NGL production from its wells or limit the number of wells or the locations which can be drilled. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and NGL within its jurisdiction.
 
Federal, state and local regulations provide detailed requirements for the abandonment of wells, closure or decommissioning of production facilities and pipelines, and for site restorations, in areas where the Underlying Properties are located. For example, the Railroad Commission of Texas imposes financial assurance requirements on operators, and the United States Army Corps of Engineers (“ACE”) and many other state and local authorities also have regulations for plugging and abandonment, decommissioning and site restoration.
 
Natural Gas Sales and Transportation.
 
Historically, federal legislation and regulatory controls have affected the price of the natural gas Avalon produces and the manner in which Avalon markets its production. FERC has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Various federal laws enacted since 1978 have resulted in the removal of all price and non-price controls for sale of domestic natural gas sold in first sales, which include all of Avalon’s sales of from the Underlying Properties. Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, FERC has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders, including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties.
 
FERC also regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions and establishes the terms under which Avalon may use interstate natural gas pipeline capacity, which affects the marketing of natural gas produced from the Underlying Properties, as well as the revenues it receives for sales of its natural gas and release of its natural gas pipeline capacity. Commencing in 1985, FERC promulgated a series of orders, regulations and rule makings that significantly fostered competition in the business of transporting and marketing gas. Currently, interstate pipeline companies are required to provide nondiscriminatory transportation services to producers, marketers and other shippers, regardless of whether such shippers are affiliated with an interstate pipeline company. FERC’s initiatives have led to the development of a competitive, open access market for natural gas purchases and sales that permits all purchasers of natural gas to buy gas directly from third-party sellers other than pipelines. However, the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated; therefore, the less stringent regulatory approach currently pursued by FERC and Congress might not continue indefinitely into the future. Avalon is not able to determine what effect, if any, future regulatory changes might have on future natural gas related activities with respect to the Underlying Properties.
 
13

 

Under FERC’s current regulatory regime, transmission services must be provided on an open-access, nondiscriminatory basis at cost-based rates or at market-based rates if the transportation market at issue is sufficiently competitive. Gathering service, which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, is regulated by the states – in the case of Texas by the Railroad Commission of Texas. Although its policy is still in flux, in the past FERC has reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non-jurisdictional gathering facilities, which has the tendency to increase the cost of transporting gas to point-of-sale locations.
 
Oil Price Controls and Transportation Rates.
 
Sales prices of oil and NGL produced from the Underlying Properties are not currently regulated and are made at market prices. Sales of these commodities are, however, subject to laws and to regulations issued by the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) prohibiting manipulative or fraudulent conduct in the wholesale petroleum market. The FTC holds substantial enforcement authority under these regulations, including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties.
 
The price received from the sale of these products may be affected by the cost of transporting the products to market. Some transportation of oil, natural gas and NGL is through interstate common carrier pipelines. Effective as of January 1, 1995, FERC implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation, subject to certain conditions and limitations. FERC’s regulation of crude oil and natural gas liquids transportation rates may tend to increase the cost of transporting crude oil and natural gas liquids by interstate pipelines, although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year. Every five years, FERC must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry. Avalon is not able at this time to predict the effects of these regulations or FERC proceedings, if any, on the transportation costs associated with crude oil producing operations.
 
Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Regulation. Oil, natural gas and NGL exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state, tribal, regional and local laws and regulations governing worker safety and health, the discharge and disposal of substances into the environment, and the protection of the environment and natural resources. Numerous governmental entities, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), ACE, and analogous state and local agencies (and, under certain laws, private individuals), have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and any permits issued under them. These laws and regulations may, among other things: (i) require permits to conduct exploration, drilling, water withdrawal, wastewater disposal and other production related activities; (ii) govern the types, quantities and concentrations of substances that may be disposed or released into the environment or injected into formations in connection with drilling or production activities, and the manner of any such disposal, release or injection; (iii) limit or prohibit construction or require formal mitigation measures in sensitive areas such as wetlands, wilderness areas or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species; (iv) require investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate pollution conditions arising from or attributable to former operations of the Underlying Properties; (v) impose safety and health restrictions designed to protect employees from exposure to hazardous or dangerous substances; and (vi) impose obligations to reclaim and abandon well sites and pits. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective action obligations, the occurrence of delays or restrictions in permitting or performance of projects and the issuance of orders enjoining operations in affected areas.
 
Since taking office, the Trump Administration has taken steps aimed at reducing federal regulatory burdens and costs for the oil and gas industry. Nevertheless, changes in environmental regulation may place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. Any changes in or more stringent enforcement of these laws and regulations that result in delays or restrictions in permitting or development of projects, or more stringent or costly construction, drilling, water management or completion activities or waste handling, storage, transport, remediation, or disposal, emission or discharge requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Trust’s revenues. Moreover, accidental releases, including spills, may occur in the course of operations on the Underlying Properties, and significant costs could be incurred as a result of such releases or spills, including third-party claims for damage to property and natural resources or personal injury. While Avalon believes that compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not materially affect operation of the Underlying Properties, it is possible that Avalon may incur substantial costs in the future related to revised or additional environmental regulations that could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations.

The following is a summary of the more significant existing and proposed environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, as amended from time to time, to which the Underlying Properties and Avalon's business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on the Trust or operation of the Underlying Properties.
 
Hazardous Substances and Wastes. The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and comparable state laws may impose strict, joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct on certain persons who are responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release of a hazardous substance occurred as well as entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, these “responsible parties” may be liable for the costs of cleaning up sites where hazardous substances have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources resulting from the release and for the costs of certain environmental and health studies. Additionally, landowners and other third parties may file claims for personal injury and natural resource and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances into the environment. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment from a hazardous substance release and to pursue steps to recover costs incurred for those actions from responsible parties. Despite the so-called “petroleum exclusion,” certain products used by Avalon and used previously by SandRidge in the course of operations at the Underlying Properties may be regulated as CERCLA hazardous substances. To date, none of the Underlying Properties have been subject to CERCLA response actions.
The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes and implementing regulations impose strict “cradle-to-grave” requirements on the generation, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. SandRidge, Avalon and any other operators of the Underlying Properties have and will generate wastes that are subject to the requirements of RCRA and comparable state statutes. Drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, production and/or development of oil and natural gas, including naturally-occurring radioactive material, if properly handled, are currently excluded from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA and, instead, are regulated under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous waste requirements. However, it is possible that these wastes could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. For example, in December 2016, the EPA and environmental groups entered into a consent decree to address the EPA’s alleged failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations exempting certain exploration and production related oil and natural gas wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. The consent decree requires the EPA to propose a rulemaking no later than March 15, 2019 for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and natural gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. The EPA fulfilled its obligation under the consent decree by issuing a determination on April 23, 2019 that revisions to existing RCRA Subtitle D regulations governing oil and natural gas wastes are not necessary, along with a report supporting that determination. Any future change in the exclusion for such wastes could potentially result in an increase in the cost of managing and disposing of those wastes.
Air Emissions and Climate Change. The federal Clean Air Act, as amended (“CAA”), and comparable state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants through emissions standards, construction and operating permitting programs, and the imposition of other compliance requirements. These laws and regulations may require pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, strict compliance with air permit requirements or the utilization of specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. The need to acquire such permits has the potential to delay or limit the development of oil and natural gas projects or require Avalon to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions-related issues.
 
Furthermore, in 2009, the EPA published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and certain other “greenhouse gases” (collectively, “GHGs”) present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. The EPA has taken a number of steps aimed at gathering information about, and reducing the emissions of, GHGs from industrial sources, including oil and natural gas sources. The EPA has adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from oil, natural gas and NGL production and processing facilities on an annual basis, as well as reporting GHG emissions from gathering and boosting systems, oil well completions and workovers using hydraulic fracturing. The EPA also has adopted and implemented regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) construction and Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that already are potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet “best available control technology” standards that typically are established by the states. This rule could adversely affect Avalon’s operations upon the Underlying Properties and restrict or delay its ability to obtain air permits for new or modified facilities that exceed GHG emission thresholds.
 
In 2012, the EPA published a final rule adopting federal New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) that require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from certain fractured and refractured natural gas wells for which well completion is conducted and further require that most wells use reduced emission completions, also known as “green completions.” These regulations also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from production-related wet seal and reciprocating compressors, and from pneumatic controllers and storage vessels. In June 2016, the EPA published a final rule adopting additional NSPS requirements for new, modified, or reconstructed oil and gas facilities that require control of the greenhouse gas methane from affected facilities, including requirements to find and repair fugitive leaks of methane emissions at well sites (“Methane Rule”). In addition, in November 2016, the U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) issued final rules to reduce methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and gas operations on federal and tribal lands (the “BLM Methane and Waste Prevention Rule”) that are substantially similar to the EPA’s Methane Rule.

The EPA also is charged with establishing ambient air quality standards, the implementation of which can indirectly impact Avalon’s operations. For example, in October 2015, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”), for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion. Although the EPA has designated all counties in which the Underlying Properties are located as attainment areas for the 2015 ozone standard, these determinations may be revised in the future. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit Avalon’s ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant.
 
Following the 2016 presidential election and change in administrations, President Trump signed Executive Order 13783 directing federal agencies to review and, if appropriate, revise all existing regulations “that potentially burden the development or use of domestic energy resources, with particular attention to oil and gas.” Pursuant to the Executive Order, the BLM and EPA commenced reviews of the BLM Methane and Waste Prevention Rule and the oil and gas NSPS, respectively. In December 2017, the BLM published a final rule to temporarily suspend or delay certain requirements contained in the November 2016 final rule until January 17, 2019, including those requirements relating to venting, flaring and leakage from oil and gas production activities. Further, in September 2018, the BLM published a final rule revising or rescinding certain provisions of the BLM Methane and Waste Prevention Rule. This action has been challenged by the states of California and New Mexico, as well as environmental groups, in the Northern District of California. Such litigation is still pending. Separately, the EPA’s review of its regulations resulted in (a) then EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt withdrawing the request for information needed to develop emissions guidelines for existing facilities in March, 2017, (b) a proposal to delay implementation of the Methane Rule, and (c) the convening of a reconsideration proceeding that resulted in two 2018 rulemaking projects aimed at rolling back certain Methane Rule requirements. In August 2019, the EPA proposed amendments to the Methane Rule  aimed at eliminating federal requirements that oil and gas companies install technology to detect and fix methane leaks from wells, pipelines and storage facilities, while maintaining the rule’s substantive emissions control requirements because they serve to control emissions of other, non-methane pollutants.. The ultimate fate of the Methane Rule requirements is unclear. Nevertheless, regulations promulgated under the CAA may require Avalon to incur expenses to install and utilize specific equipment, technologies, or work practices to control emissions from its operations.
 
The Congressional reaction to the BLM and EPA action has been mixed, but there seems to be growing support, at least in the House of Representatives, in support for maintaining and potentially strengthening methane regulation. During the current Congressional session, five bills have been introduced which, if enacted, would codify existing methane regulations and/or force additional regulatory action. Examples include the Super Pollutants Act (H.R. 4143), which would codify the oil and gas NSPS and require the EPA to develop emissions guidelines for existing oil and gas facilities within two years, and the CLEAN Future Act which aims to achieve a 100% clean economy by not later than 2050 including a plan to achieve “net zero” GHGs.
 
Although future federal GHG regulations for the oil and gas industry remain a possibility given the long-term trend towards increasing regulation, the form of these regulations remains uncertain as the Trump administration has made it clear they will oppose any such regulation. Moreover, several states have already adopted rules requiring operators of both new and existing oil and gas facilities to develop and implement leak detection and repair (“LDAR”) program and to install devices on certain equipment to capture 95% of methane emissions. Compliance with these rules could require Avalon to purchase pollution control equipment and optical gas imaging equipment for LDAR inspections, and to hire additional personnel to assist with inspection and reporting requirements.
 
Compliance with these and other air pollution control and permitting requirements has the potential to increase Avalon’s production costs, which costs could be significant. Additionally, violations of lease conditions or regulations related to air emissions can result in civil and criminal penalties, as well as potential court injunctions curtailing operations and canceling leases. Such enforcement liabilities can result from either governmental or citizen enforcement.
 
Water Discharges. The federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and analogous state laws and implementing regulations impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States and waters of the states, respectively. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, the discharge of pollutants to regulated waters is prohibited unless it is permitted by the EPA, ACE or an analogous state agency. The discharge of wastewater from most onshore oil and gas exploration and production activities is currently prohibited east of the 98th meridian. Additionally, in June 2016, the EPA issued a final rule implementing wastewater pre-treatment standards that prohibit onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities from sending wastewater directly to publicly owned treatment works (“POTW”). Unconventional extraction facilities are in certain circumstances allowed by federal regulations to send wastewater to an off-site private centralized wastewater treatment facility that can either discharge treated water or send it to a POTW. The EPA is conducting a study of the treatment and discharge of oil and gas wastewater. Any restriction of disposal options for hydraulic fracturing waste and other changes to CWA discharge requirements may result in increased costs. Avalon does not presently discharge pollutants associated with the exploration, development and production of oil, natural gas and NGL on the Underlying Properties into federal or state waters. Rather, it disposes of such fluids by regulated injection into salt water disposal wells located on the Underlying Properties in compliance with the Underground Injection Control program described below.

How the EPA and the ACE define “waters of the United States” (“WOTUS”) can impact Avalon’s regulatory and permitting obligations under the CWA. The EPA and the ACE promulgated rules defining the scope of WOTUS that became effective in September 2015. On October 22, 2019, the EPA and the ACE published a final rule that repealed the 2015 definition of WOTUS and recodified longstanding regulatory definitions of WOTUS that existed prior to the 2015 rule to promote regulatory consistency across the United States. On February 14, 2019, EPA and the ACE had published a proposed revised definition of WOTUS intended to clarify and narrow the definition from that in the 2015 rule. The comment period on the proposed changes to the definition of WOTUS closed on April 15, 2019, and a final rule is expected to be published in early 2020. It is anticipated that petitions for review of any 2020 WOTUS rule will be filed and that litigation over the definition of WOTUS will continue. To the extent that Avalon must obtain permits for the discharge of pollutants or for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas or other waters of the United States, Avalon could face increased costs and delays associated with obtaining such permits under any broader definition of WOTUS that expands the scope of CWA jurisdiction.
 
Finally, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”), which amends the CWA, establishes standards for prevention, containment and cleanup of oil spills into waters of the United States. The OPA requires measures to be taken to prevent the accidental discharge of oil into waters of the United States from onshore production facilities. Measures under the OPA and/or the CWA include: inspection and maintenance programs to minimize spills from oil storage and conveyance systems; the use of secondary containment systems to prevent spills from reaching nearby waterbodies; proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill; and the development and implementation of spill prevention, control and countermeasure (“SPCC”) plans to prevent and respond to oil spills. The OPA also subjects owners and operators of facilities to strict, joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a spill. SandRidge has developed and implemented SPCC plans for the Underlying Properties as required under the CWA, and Avalon is continuing to administer these SPCC plans.
 
Subsurface Injections. Any underground injection operations that may be performed by Avalon in the future are subject to the Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”), as well as analogous state laws and regulations. Under the SDWA, the EPA established the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program, which established the minimum program requirements for state and local programs regulating underground injection activities. The UIC program includes requirements for permitting, testing, monitoring, record keeping and reporting of injection well activities, as well as a prohibition against the migration of fluid containing any contaminant into underground sources of drinking water. Texas state regulations require a permit from the Railroad Commission of Texas to operate underground injection wells. Avalon has obtained such UIC permits. Although Avalon monitors the injection process of its injectionl wells, any leakage from the subsurface portions of such wells could cause degradation of fresh groundwater resources, potentially resulting in suspension of Avalon’s UIC permit, issuance of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of the affected resource and imposition of liability by third-parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages and personal injuries. Some states have considered laws mandating flowback and produced water recycling. Other states, including Texas, have undertaken studies to assess the feasibility of recycling produced water on a large scale. For example, in July 2018, the EPA partnered with New Mexico to evaluate alternatives to injection of wastewater from exploration and production activities by reusing it or treating it for reintroduction into the hydrologic cycle or both, and to propose potential regulations related thereto. If laws mandating reuse and/or treatment in lieu of injection are adopted for the counties in which the Underlying Properties are located, Avalon’s operating costs may increase significantly.
 
Endangered Species. The federal Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats without first obtaining an incidental take permit and implementing mitigation measures. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act. If endangered species are located in areas of the Underlying Properties where seismic surveys, development activities or abandonment operations may be conducted, the work could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required. In February 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“USFWS”) published a final policy which alters how it identifies critical habitat for endangered and threatened species. On August 27, 2019, the USFWS published a final rule adopting several changes to ESA regulations, including changes to the procedures and criteria for listing or removing species from the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants and for designating critical habitat. A critical habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal and private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or development. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where operations on the Underlying Properties are located could cause Avalon to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on the ability to develop and produce reserves from the Underlying Properties.
 
Employee Health and Safety. The operations of Avalon are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the Hazard Communication Standard implemented by OSHA requires Avalon to maintain information concerning hazardous materials used or produced in its operations and to provide this information to employees. Pursuant to the Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, facilities that store hazardous chemicals that are subject to OSHA’s Hazard Communication Standard above certain threshold quantities must submit information regarding those chemicals by March 1 of each year to state and local authorities in order to facilitate emergency planning and response. That information is generally available to employees, state and local governmental authorities, and the public. Avalon has been and is submitting this information to these authorities for the Underlying Properties.
