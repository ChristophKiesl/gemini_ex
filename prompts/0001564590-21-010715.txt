Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on improving the lives of patients with genetically defined rare diseases in areas of high unmet medical need. We have developed a proprietary product engine that we employ to systematically identify and validate cellular drug targets that can potentially modulate gene expression to treat the known root cause of genetically defined diseases. We are using our product engine to identify targets that can be drugged by small molecules regardless of the particular underlying mechanism of gene mis-expression. We have identified drug targets to treat the root causes of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, or FSHD, and certain hemoglobinopathies, namely sickle cell disease, or SCD, and ß-thalassemia. In August 2019, we initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, international Phase 2b clinical trial of losmapimod, our product candidate for FSHD, and a single center, open label Phase 2 clinical trial to investigate the safety and tolerability of chronic treatment with losmapimod in patients with FSHD. The Phase 2b clinical trial and the open label Phase 2 clinical trial completed enrollment in February 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of FTX-6058, our product candidate for certain hemoglobinopathies and a novel upregulator of fetal hemoglobin, to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of FTX-6058 in healthy adult volunteers. In addition, we anticipate initiating a clinical trial of FTX-6058 in patients with SCD in the second half of 2021.
 We are using our proprietary product engine to identify and validate drug targets and develop product candidates to address diseases caused by the mis-expression of certain genes. Our product engine integrates patient-derived, tissue-relevant cell models and drug target screens with our pharmacologically-diverse small molecule compound library and customized CRISPR and RNAi libraries. We also employ computational biology and FulcrumSeek, our proprietary database, to guide target selection and to generate hypotheses on other targets that might be relevant along a gene regulatory pathway. 
 Our first product candidate, losmapimod, is a small molecule that we are developing for the treatment of FSHD, a rare, progressive and disabling muscle wasting disorder that leads to significant physical impairments and disability. Losmapimod selectively targets p38α/ß mitogen activated protein kinase, or p38α/ß. We utilized our product engine to discover that inhibition of p38α/ß reduced expression of the DUX4 gene in muscle cells derived from patients with FSHD. The mis-expression of the DUX4 gene is the known root cause of FSHD. There are no approved therapies for FSHD, one of the most common forms of muscular dystrophy, with an estimated patient population of 16,000 to 38,000 in the United States. In January 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, granted orphan drug designation to losmapimod for the treatment of FSHD, and, in March 2020, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, granted orphan drug designation to losmapimod for the treatment of FSHD.
 Following our discovery of the role of p38α/ß inhibitors in the reduction of DUX4 expression in patients with FSHD, we performed an extensive review of known compounds. As a result of our evaluation, we identified losmapimod as the preferred developmental candidate based on the substantial and attractive preclinical and clinical data. We in-licensed losmapimod from affiliates of GlaxoSmithKline, or GSK, in February 2019. GSK had previously treated nearly 3,500 subjects with losmapimod across multiple clinical trials, including one Phase 3 clinical trial. GSK did not conduct a clinical trial of losmapimod in patients with FSHD or any other muscle disorder. We have conducted extensive preclinical testing of losmapimod in patient-derived, tissue-relevant cell models and have observed that losmapimod selectively reduced DUX4-driven gene expression and restored a healthy gene expression signature with minimal impact on healthy human muscle cells or other cell types. 
 We are conducting a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, international Phase 2b clinical trial, referred to as ReDUX4, to investigate whether treatment with losmapimod reduces DUX4-driven gene expression in affected skeletal muscle. In this Phase 2b clinical trial, secondary endpoints include evaluation of safety and tolerability in FSHD patients, pharmacokinetic in blood, losmapimod concentration in skeletal muscle biopsies, p38α/ß target engagement in blood and in muscle biopsies, and efficacy on the whole-body skeletal muscle MRI biomarker. We are concurrently conducting a single center open label Phase 2 clinical trial to investigate the safety and tolerability of chronic treatment with losmapimod in patients with FSHD. In this open label trial, we are evaluating the ability of losmapimod to reduce DUX4-driven gene expression in affected skeletal muscle over varying treatment durations. We initiated ReDUX4 at multiple sites in the United States, Canada and Europe and the open label Phase 2 clinical trial in Europe in August 2019. We completed dosing in a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers and patients with FSHD in September 2019. We presented top-line, blinded results from the Phase 1 clinical trial in October 2019, and we presented unblinded data in March 2020. We utilized data from GSK’s clinical trials of losmapimod and our preclinical data to submit an IND, and clinical trial applications, or CTAs, in 
 1


Europe and Canada, at various dates during 2019 that have enabled us to advance our clinical development plan for losmapimod in FSHD, including initiating ReDUX4 in August 2019.
 As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we extended the ReDUX4 treatment period from 24 to 48 weeks through a protocol amendment to ensure the safety of the subjects and to allow for the opportunity for a biopsy at week 16 as originally intended or at week 36. Approximately 64 subjects who did not complete the original 24-week treatment period continued in the 48-week treatment period in the randomized portion of the trial. The extension from 24 to 48 weeks also allows for a longer assessment in a placebo-controlled design of the skeletal muscle MRI secondary endpoint and the various exploratory clinical endpoints, such as reachable workspace, optimized time up and go test for FSHD, muscle function measures and patient reported outcomes. We expect to present full data from the trial in the second quarter of 2021. We believe that the amendment to the trial protocol provides flexibility to address the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and supports collection of efficacy and safety data to support continued discussions with regulatory agencies regarding potential registration strategies.
 In August 2020, we announced results from a pre-specified interim analysis of the primary endpoint of the ReDUX4 trial, which is the reduction from baseline of DUX4-driven gene expression in affected skeletal muscle after subjects have been treated with losmapimod or placebo.
 We are additionally conducting several preparatory non-drug studies to assess biomarker endpoints and clinical outcome assessments and are participating in a natural history study that will follow 160 subjects with FSHD in the United States and 60 subjects in Europe over 18 months. We are using data generated to date, and expect to utilize data to be generated from our ongoing preparatory studies and the natural history study to inform future clinical trial designs and discussions with regulatory agencies. We believe that these preparatory studies and the safety data from GSK’s prior losmapimod clinical trials, together with safety and efficacy data generated from our Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials to date, and additional data to be generated from our ongoing ReDUX4 trial, may enable us to apply for accelerated approval of losmapimod for the treatment of FSHD. If we observe positive results in ReDUX4 based on our biomarker efficacy endpoint of reduction in DUX4-driven gene expression in affected skeletal muscle, we plan to discuss the possibility of applying for accelerated approval with regulatory agencies and may seek accelerated approval if such regulatory agencies believe that our biomarker endpoint is sufficiently predictive of clinical benefit. The FDA or other regulatory authorities may require us to conduct comparability assessments of GSK-manufactured tablets to tablets manufactured by us or another party. 
 In June 2020, we announced that we received notification from the FDA that we may proceed with initiating a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of losmapimod in higher risk hospitalized adults with COVID-19, or the LOSVID trial. The LOSVID trial is a Phase 3, international, multicenter trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a 15 mg twice per day oral dose of losmapimod compared to placebo for 14 days on top of standard of care in approximately 400 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and at risk of progression to critical illness based on older age and elevated systemic inflammation. We began enrolling patients in the fourth quarter of 2020. The primary endpoint of the trial is the proportion of patients who progress to death or respiratory failure by day 28. The trial’s secondary endpoints include clinical status on days seven and 14 as measured on the nine point World Health Organization ordinal scale of COVID-19 severity, total number of study days free of oxygen supplementation, all-cause mortality, length of hospitalization and intensive care unit stay, adverse events and viral clearance. In March 2021, we announced the discontinuation of the LOSVID trial following a strategic review. 
 Our second product candidate, FTX-6058, is our novel small molecule designed to bind embryonic ectoderm development, or EED, and inhibit the transcriptional silencing activity of the polycomb repressive complex 2, or PRC2. FTX-6058 is a small molecule designed to upregulate fetal hemoglobin in patients with SCD and ß-thalassemia. SCD is a genetic blood disorder caused by a mutation in the ß-subunit gene, or HBB gene. This mutation results in the formation of abnormal hemoglobin, which causes red blood cells, or RBCs, to change from a round shape into a sickle shape that significantly impairs their function. ß-thalassemia is a rare blood disorder caused by various genetic mutations in the HBB gene that can significantly impair the production of RBCs. 
 We designed FTX-6058
 to compensate for the root cause of these hemoglobinopathies by inducing the expression of the two γ-globin genes, HBG1/2, whose expression is normally silenced shortly after birth. The HBG1/2 genes encode for γ-globin, a component of fetal hemoglobin, which is known to compensate for the presence of abnormal hemoglobin in SCD and ß-thalassemia. We have observed in vitro and in vivo activation of the HBG1/2 genes in preclinical studies with FTX-6058. We have also observed that FTX-6058 demonstrated robust levels of fetal hemoglobin elevation with no adverse effect on important cellular health markers. We conducted additional pre-clinical profiling in CD34+ derived cells and observed that treatment with FTX-6058 increased HbF levels to approximately 30% of total hemoglobin, as measured by mass 
 2


spectrometry, high performance liquid chromatography, and fast protein liquid chromatography techniques. The elevation of HbF was significantly greater than we observed with hydroxyurea in the cell models.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, we initiated our Phase 1 clinical trial of FTX-6058 in healthy adult volunteers. In this trial, we are evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of FTX-6058. The trial is comprised of four parts. Part A is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study in up to six cohorts. Part B is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose study in up to four cohorts dosed once daily for 14 days. Part C is an open label pilot food effect study in subjects randomized to take FTX-6058 with and without a high-fat meal, and Part D is an open label study to evaluate the potential of FTX-6058 to induce a liver enzyme known as CYP3A, which is involved in drug metabolism. We expect to present data from the Phase 1 clinical trial in mid-2021. In addition, we anticipate initiating a clinical trial of FTX-6058 in patients with SCD in the second half of 2021.
 According to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, there are approximately 7,000 rare, genetically defined human diseases, many of which have inadequate or no approved treatments. Our current drug target identification and development efforts are focused on rare neuromuscular, muscular, hematologic and central nervous system, or CNS, disorders. We also anticipate utilizing our product engine to discover drug targets for genetically defined diseases in other therapeutic areas and for other disorders. In addition to drug targets that we prioritize for internal development, we may identify other drug targets that we would consider for development through partnerships. For example, we are utilizing our product engine to discover drug targets within a targeted indication within the pulmonary disease space under our collaboration and license agreement with Acceleron Pharma Inc., or Acceleron, and for the potential treatment of certain genetically defined cardiomyopathies under our collaboration and license agreement with MyoKardia, Inc., or MyoKardia, a wholly owned subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company.
 Our Pipeline 
 We designed our proprietary product engine with potential application across a broad array of genetically defined diseases with a known root cause. The following chart summarizes key information about our lead product candidates.

Our Strategy
We are leveraging the broad applicability of our proprietary product engine to discover and develop small molecule therapies that modulate gene expression to address the known root cause of genetically defined rare diseases in areas of high unmet medical need. We believe that our initial product candidates for the treatment of FSHD, SCD and ß-thalassemia may have the potential to treat patients with these debilitating and, in some cases, life-threatening and novel illnesses. The key components of our strategy include: 

• | Rapidly develop losmapimod for the treatment of FSHD. We aim to rapidly develop losmapimod for the treatment of FSHD through clinical development and regulatory approval. We initiated a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter international Phase 2b clinical trial of losmapimod, or ReDUX4, in August 2019 and, subject to positive results, plan to meet with regulators to discuss the potential to pursue accelerated approval given the significant unmet medical need in FSHD and the absence of approved therapies for patients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rapidly develop FTX-6058 for the treatment of select hemoglobinopathies. We have initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of FTX-6058 in healthy adult volunteers and, subject to positive results, plan to initiate a clinical trial of FTX-6058 in patients with SCD in the second half of 2021.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to apply our proprietary product engine to grow our portfolio of product candidates for the treatment of genetically defined diseases. We have developed a rigorous assessment and selection process to determine which of the approximately 7,000 rare, genetically defined diseases we intend to evaluate in drug target identification activities. We are applying our product engine to discover drug targets to modulate gene expression and develop product candidates for the potential treatment of the root cause of disease.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Further expand our product engine capabilities. Our product engine incorporates patient-derived cell lines and/or other relevant human cell lines, our annotated small molecule compound library and customized CRISPR or RNAi libraries. We intend to further expand our product engine capabilities, including FulcrumSeek, to enhance the therapeutic reach and productivity of our drug discovery process.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maximize the commercial potential of our product candidates. We have retained all rights to our lead product candidates focused on rare genetically defined diseases, and plan to commercialize any approved product for such rare genetically defined diseases using a targeted sales infrastructure. We may in the future pursue commercialization partnerships for certain product candidates and/or markets outside the United States.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Selectively enter into strategic partnerships to maximize the value of our product engine and pipeline. Given the breadth of opportunities for our proprietary product engine to discover drug targets and develop product candidates for genetically defined diseases, we may enter into strategic partnerships for certain drug targets, product candidates or disease areas, such as our collaboration and license agreements with Acceleron and MyoKardia. Partnerships may provide an attractive avenue for expanding the impact of our proprietary product engine.

Gene Regulation 
 The human genome provides the blueprint, or genetic code, for life. The sequencing of the human genome has enabled significant insights into understanding the genetic underpinnings of many diseases. Genes are the fundamental units of biology, but the gene itself is rather static. The identity and function of each cell is determined by a specific set of factors that activate or repress mechanisms that regulate genes in the desired manner. There are many mechanisms that control the human genome by up or down regulating gene expression, and these regulatory mechanisms are controlled by various pathways and signals. Defects in a gene or any of these regulatory mechanisms can result in aberrant expression or silencing of a gene that may lead to disease.

The graphic below illustrates the key steps in the gene expression process in cells and how they are under the control of a variety of regulatory signals and pathways. 
 

Our Opportunity 
 We have the ability to develop, scale and characterize complex cellular models of human disorders of gene mis-regulation. Our current drug target identification and development efforts are focused on rare neuromuscular, muscular, hematologic and CNS disorders. We also anticipate utilizing our product engine to discover drug targets for genetically defined diseases in other therapeutic areas. Our target identification and validation process provides a systematic way to approach the identification of unique drug targets that, when activated or inhibited, may increase or decrease gene expression in genetically defined diseases with the aim of restoring a healthy or functional phenotype. Our product engine is designed to be agnostic to cell type, pathway and therapeutic modality. While our drug target selection process is guided by our strategy to advance small molecule therapeutics that treat the root cause of disease into clinical development, we also may identify drug targets that might be addressable by other treatment modalities, such as antisense oligonucleotides, or ASOs, small interfering RNAs, or siRNAs, or antibodies. 
 We are continuing to expand our proprietary database, FulcrumSeek, which is designed to facilitate the process by which we assess diseases and generate drug target hypotheses through our computational biology expertise. We screen our proprietary small molecule library and customized CRISPR or RNAi libraries across healthy and diseased human cells, such as skeletal muscle cells, cardiac muscle cells, brain cells and blood cells. Our FulcrumSeek database is designed to provide a unique understanding into gene regulatory and signaling pathways that may be relevant for the activation or repression of a particular gene associated with the disease of interest. To achieve this, we profile many features that are impacted when a cell of interest is treated with a perturbagen, such as a small molecule probe, CRISPR guide, small interfering RNA, or microRNAs. These features include a comprehensive assessment of transcripts that are modulated (quantified by RNA sequencing, or RNAseq) and cellular processes that are measured by imaging techniques. We expect that the data from these screens will allow us to develop a broader understanding of biology that may be relevant in disease. With the completion of each additional screening, FulcrumSeek increases in size, and our insights and knowledge are further expanded. Moreover, with the initiation of our collaborations with Acceleron and MyoKardia, we are further demonstrating the scope of our disease modeling and target identification capabilities with the expansion into pulmonary and cardiovascular disease.

According to the NIH there are approximately 7,000 rare, genetically defined human diseases, many of which have inadequate or no approved treatments. We believe that our approach to selecting and modeling certain of these human diseases with patient-derived tissue-relevant cells, followed by mining our FulcrumSeek database or screening with our proprietary small molecule library and customized CRISPR or RNAi libraries, could be broadly applied to the identification of drug targets that have the potential to balance the expression of many genes known to drive or ameliorate disease. 
 Our Approach 
 The ability to intervene in gene regulatory pathways that control gene expression provides the basis of our product engine. Our approach is to broadly search for mechanisms that can change gene expression in the desired manner. These drug targets may be intracellular targets or extracellular targets that affect a signaling pathway. Key considerations we use to determine which genetically defined diseases are suitable to evaluate in drug target identification activities include: 

• | Unmet medical need and market opportunity: we consider the severity of disease, the number of patients who could be treated and the competitive landscape.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Clear mechanistic link between a root cause genetic defect and disease: we evaluate whether there is genetic validation of the gene’s role in disease and the effect of gene modulation on disease.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Drug discovery execution: we consider whether relevant patient-derived, tissue-specific cell models and assays are available or whether we can develop such models using our expertise.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Clinical feasibility: we evaluate potential biomarker and clinical endpoints, whether there is a meaningful treatment window and whether there is an accessible patient population to undertake clinical trials in a reasonable time frame.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our product engine is designed to enable us to address diseases in which genes are mis-expressed, silenced or result in mutated gene products, such as RNA or protein, due to an underlying genetic defect. There are varied approaches to treating disease by balancing gene expression including reducing the expression of a gene that causes disease (e.g., DUX4 in FSHD), increasing the expression of an under-expressed gene or expressing a compensatory gene (e.g., HBG1/2 in SCD and ß-thalassemia). Our preclinical modeling of the relevant tissue is critical for success, and we believe this is best achieved using human cell systems derived from patients with the disease. We primarily seek to identify drug targets that may balance gene expression in these human cell systems and that are amenable to drugging using a small molecule. In addition to drug targets that we prioritize for internal development, we may identify other drug targets that we would consider for development through partnerships. 
 Overview of Our Product Engine 
 Our product engine is a high-throughput discovery platform that we designed to identify and validate drug targets that balance the expression of the genes known to drive or ameliorate root cause biology. We obtain patient-derived, tissue-relevant cell lines or other relevant human cell lines. We then differentiate these cell lines into those most relevant for the disease pathology, including skeletal muscle myotubes, cardiomyocytes, neurons, RBCs, or other cell lines of interest, which we then scale up, characterize and prepare for screening. We also generate methods to quantify the desired modulation of expression of the gene of interest in these cell lines. We apply our annotated small molecule compound library and customized CRISPR or RNAi libraries to the cells to assess for the desired modulation. We have continued to build our capabilities to maximally profile changes in transcription that occur when relevant cells are treated with small molecules or genetic reagents. In addition to profiling a specific gene of interest, we can evaluate multiple genes of potential interest through multiplexed transcriptome profiling to assess effects on root cause biology. FulcrumSeek is a further expansion of this concept, where thousands of transcripts can be measured, and additional features of cellular health and function can be assessed using high-throughput imaging techniques. Our screening approach, coupled with data mining of FulcrumSeek, is the basis of our target identification strategy. We confirm drug target hits with multiple modalities and undertake further validation in several patient-derived, tissue-relevant cell lines. Additional studies in these cell models are conducted to understand how the modulation of the gene of interest affects cellular function. We employ computational biology, such as machine learning algorithms, using our FulcrumSeek database and other databases to guide drug target selection and generate hypotheses on other drug targets that might be related along a gene regulatory pathway. 
 To further optimize and increase productivity of our product engine, we have continued to invest in customized lab automation and applied technologies. We believe that these investments have increased assay throughput and robustness and have expanded the breadth of biological parameters we can effectively measure in our assay systems. The first-generation of our product engine was focused on single gene readouts, simple immunocytochemistry, and one-dimensional data analysis focused on an individual gene of interest. With continued investment in the product engine, we have enabled our next-
 6


generation product engine which utilizes RNAseq, high-content imaging, and machine learning. We believe that this next-generation product engine enables drug target screening at scale in physiologically relevant assay systems. 
 

 We designed our discovery and development model to recapitulate this systematic approach of applying our product engine to each new disease that we evaluate with the goal of providing disease-modifying therapies to patients. The following graphic presents an overview of our drug target identification process. 
 

7


Importantly, we designed our next-generation product engine to iteratively and systematically explore disease or indication areas of interest by incorporating both preclinical and clinical data related to potential drug targets. In the case of heterogeneous diseases, this iterative and systematic approach enables us to explore diseases with less defined root cause genes, and instead screen for targets that modulate root cause biology. This approach not only enables us to validate the translatability of our preclinical models to the clinic, but also enables us to generate unique clinical biology insights utilizing public and proprietary clinical datasets, that can be further queried by our FulcrumSeek database or incorporated into our preclinical disease models. As a result, we believe that our next-generation product engine greatly expands the number of diseases that we can potentially interrogate using our screening approach.
 Patient-Derived Tissue-Relevant Cell Models 
 Accurate modeling of human disease is critical for drug discovery endeavors, and we have the ability to model disease and identify drug targets that modulate gene expression in patient-derived, differentiated cells. These cells provide the appropriate context in which to understand signaling pathways that affect human gene expression and function, and have the potential to increase the translatability from preclinical studies to clinical trials. Prior to initiating screening activities, we characterize and expand the cells. We also create a cell line where the genetic defect associated with the disease has been corrected, or use a cell line from a healthy individual, in order to compare the gene regulation between diseased and normal cells. If the degree of gene activation or repression required to have a functional benefit is not known, we will undertake physiological characterization of these cell lines in order to define what threshold of gene regulation is functionally relevant. 
 Our process to characterize patient-derived cell models, produce cells at scale and develop suitable screens to identify drug targets typically takes between six and nine months. Depending on the disease, we may design the screen to measure effects on RNA and/or protein. 
 Drug Target Identification 
 We employ three approaches to identify drug targets that can potentially modulate gene expression to treat genetically defined diseases at the root cause—two lab-based library screening approaches as well as computational biology using our FulcrumSeek database and other databases. We then evaluate possible drug targets identified from these efforts with the goal to advance programs into lead optimization. 
Small Molecule Probe Library Screening 
 Our small molecule probe library is annotated, which means it consists of known, well-characterized molecules that interact with biochemical mechanisms and that have cellular activity. The purpose of our small molecule probe library is to identify and interrogate mechanisms that regulate the expression of genes of interest. We designed our library with the intent to optimize biological diversity, in contrast with other small molecule screening approaches that optimize chemical diversity. The library was developed by our medicinal chemists who reviewed primary and patent literature to identify probe molecules that interact with known biochemical targets. They selected chemical probes based on their cellular activity, potency and selectivity. In order to expand our library beyond commercially-available small molecules, we undertook a custom synthesis campaign to generate compounds that were not available from commercial sources. Our library currently includes more than 6,000 small molecules relating to approximately 2,500 biochemical targets covering a wide breadth of pharmacology, including chromatin modifiers, transcription regulation and RNA processing, kinases and metabolic enzymes. Our library will continue to expand as we identify and acquire new mechanistic probes. 
Genetic Screening 
 We may also use a customized CRISPR or RNAi library screening, which is an approach to interrogate the genome by selectively knocking out, reducing or increasing gene expression, for target identification. We have chosen to use CRISPR and RNAi libraries as complementary or additional screening tools for drug target identification alongside our small molecule screening approach. We use both an array-based CRISPR library and our pooled, custom-designed CRISPR library. Pooled CRISPR screening is an approach to target identification in which we combine cells and reagents in a single tube to simplify the experimental procedures. Pooled CRISPR screening is not suitable for all cell types, and we use array-based CRISPR screening where appropriate. Additionally, we utilize RNAi libraries where CRISPR libraries cannot be employed in the cell type of interest. Specific targets that modulate the gene of interest can be identified via CRISPR or RNAi library screening, and these targets can then be validated for our drug discovery endeavors. If small molecules that interact with these targets are identified from the literature, they are then obtained for further pharmacological validation. If no known chemical matter is available, we may establish a screen to identify chemical matter that interacts with the drug target. This chemical matter 
 8


would serve as a starting point for medicinal chemistry work. Alternatively, we may seek partnerships for development using other modalities. 
 FulcrumSeek and Computational Biology 
 FulcrumSeek is our proprietary database containing profiles of the effect of perturbagens, or disruptions to cellular processes, on disease-relevant, human derived cell systems. The features captured in this database consist of measures of gene regulation on thousands of genes, and other important assessments of cellular function and health. The primary role of FulcrumSeek and our computational biology capabilities is to generate drug target and biomarker hypotheses using externally generated patient data and internal screening data. We can use FulcrumSeek to aid in the selection of diseases that we may want to consider for a discovery program. Our database and analysis can provide information as to which genes are modulated by our perturbagens and which genes may be difficult to modulate. This information is then integrated into our decision-making process for disease selection. Using FulcrumSeek, our approach is to leverage our network biology capabilities and expertise to determine how pathways interact with each other in a cell, to develop a network map of regulatory interactions that control gene expression and cellular function and propose targets that potentially could be pursued to modulate the root cause gene or root cause biology of diseases of interest. In each case, we explore these hypotheses through biological experimentation designed to validate predicted drug targets and biomarkers. We use confirmatory studies to aid in the refinement of our computational models in an iterative manner.
 

Drug Target Validation 
 Our initial focus on drug target validation is to establish a robust link between the drug target that we identified through our screening approaches and modulation of the expression of the root cause gene of interest. Our validation work seeks to evaluate identified drug targets in a manner that allows us to prioritize targets where we may be able to deliver safe and effective therapies to patients. We conduct our validation tests using a diverse set of pharmacological tools and multiple genetic reagents to profile their effect on orthogonal read-outs of gene expression (RNA and protein) and the subsequent effects on physiological function. 
 The important elements of our systematic approach to drug target validation include: 
  
• | Evaluation of different treatment modalities to interact with the drug target: we evaluate whether small molecules and genomic modulation approaches similarly affect expression of the gene of interest.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Efficacy: we attempt to establish a link between the identified drug target and the level of the expression of the gene of interest.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Safety: we evaluate whether modulation of the target and the resulting changes in gene expression cause undesired effects, including an assessment of cell health markers to ensure there is minimal cellular toxicity.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Profiling cell lines from multiple patients: we analyze the modulation of the drug target to determine whether the original cell line used to screen targets is representative of disease in other patients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Verification: we conduct studies designed to ensure that the modulation of the drug target and the resulting change in gene expression leads to a desired functional effect.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Prioritization: we prioritize drug targets based on our assessment of our ability to deliver a candidate for clinical development based on that target.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Development Candidate Discovery and Characterization 
 Following target identification and target validation, we initiate medicinal chemistry and drug discovery activities to advance a development candidate that is suitable for testing in clinical trials. This work optimizes characteristics that are important for an orally available small molecule, including potency, selectivity, pharmacokinetic, or PK, and safety parameters. There is an opportunity to bypass or considerably accelerate discovery and characterization activities if we identify and validate an attractive drug target that has been pursued previously by others in different indications. For example, available chemical matter and support from the scientific literature regarding p38α/ß enabled us to rapidly identify our product candidate for the treatment of FSHD. 
 A key element of our preclinical compound profiling approach is to investigate a development candidate across many patient-derived tissue-relevant cells. We choose these cells based on our assessment of the patient heterogeneity that may be encountered in clinical trials. The purpose of this analysis is to enable us to understand if the activity of the molecule differs among cells with different genetic subtypes, or if a patient stratification strategy is appropriate for clinical trials. 
 Many genetically defined diseases are not well modeled with animal models because such models do not have appropriate predictive validity. In these cases, we seek to develop an engraftment model where patient-derived human cells are engrafted into the relevant tissue of a host, immunodeficient mouse to produce a chimeric mouse. We may use these chimeric mice to assess gene regulation in the engrafted human cells, and for the efficient development of PK-pharmacodynamic, or PK/PD, relationships that will be the basis of therapeutic index calculations and human dose projections. 
 Advantages of a Small Molecule Approach 
 We believe that our approach to the treatment of genetically defined diseases using orally available, small molecule therapeutics may offer significant advantages over other treatment modalities due to: 

• | Biodistribution: small molecules can achieve broad distribution in the body. The ability to access tissues broadly is particularly relevant in neuromuscular disorders where multiple muscles are affected by disease, or in CNS disorders where brain permeability may be limited with other treatment modalities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Product Candidate for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy 
 Overview of Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy 
 Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is a rare, progressive and disabling disease for which there are no approved treatments. FSHD is one of the most common forms of muscular dystrophy and affects both sexes equally, with onset typically in teens and young adults. FSHD is characterized by progressive skeletal muscle loss that initially causes weakness in muscles in the face, shoulders, arms and trunk and progresses to weakness in muscles in lower extremities and the pelvic girdle. Skeletal muscle weakness results in significant physical limitations, including progressive loss of facial muscles that can cause an inability to smile or communicate, difficulty using arms for activities of daily living and difficulty getting out of bed, with many patients ultimately becoming dependent upon the use of a wheelchair for daily mobility activities. The majority of patients with FSHD also report experiencing chronic pain, anxiety and depression. The diagnosis and treatment of patients with FSHD is typically performed by neurologists. 
 The FSH Society estimated that the prevalence of FSHD in the United States is approximately 1 in 20,000 people. A recent study conducted in the Netherlands reported a more frequent prevalence of 1 in 8,333. Based on these estimates and a U.S. population of 320 million, we estimate that the patient population is between 16,000 to 38,000 in the United States. We believe that there may be additional patients who are not formally diagnosed due to a perceived difficulty of obtaining a diagnosis and the fact that there are no approved treatments. Approximately two-thirds of cases are familial-inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and one-third of cases are sporadic. FSHD affects all ethnic groups with similar incidence and prevalence. 
 FSHD Biology 
 FSHD is caused by aberrant expression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle resulting in the inappropriate presence of DUX4 protein, a transcription factor causing the expression of other genes. Normally DUX4-driven gene expression is limited to early embryonic development, after which time the DUX4 gene is silenced. In patients with FSHD, aberrant production of DUX4 protein in skeletal muscle regulates other genes encoding proteins, some of which are toxic to the muscle. Aberrant DUX4-driven gene expression is the major molecular signature that distinguishes muscle tissue affected by FSHD from healthy muscle. The result of aberrant DUX4 expression in FSHD is death of muscle and its replacement by fat, resulting in skeletal muscle weakness and progressive disability. We believe that reducing expression of the DUX4 gene and its downstream transcriptional program could provide a disease-modifying therapeutic approach for the treatment of FSHD at its root cause. Published preclinical and human data, in addition to in vitro experiments that we have conducted, suggest that any reduction in DUX4 expression may be beneficial for patients. In preclinical studies, we have demonstrated that there is a direct relationship between muscle cell death (apoptosis) and the level of DUX4 expression, and a reduction in DUX4 leads to a concomitant decrease in apoptosis. As illustrated in the graphic below, in animal models where expression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle is induced, a corresponding loss of function is observed with increasing levels of DUX4 expression. In these animal models where low levels of DUX4 are expressed, the animals performed similarly to healthy animals in a mobility assessment, suggesting that complete DUX4 reduction is not required for a functional benefit. Data from human muscle biopsies likewise indicated that increased DUX4 activity is related to worsening muscle pathology.
 

In all patients with FSHD, the DUX4 gene is unsilenced, or de-repressed, as a result of one of two different types of genetic alterations, leading to FSHD1 or FSHD2. Approximately 95% of patients have FSHD1 and approximately 5% of patients have FSHD2. FSHD1 is caused by the contraction of an array of DNA, known as a D4Z4 repeat, from greater than ten repeat units to nine or fewer units. This contraction causes de-repression of DUX4. Patients with FSHD2 do not have meaningful D4Z4 repeat contraction, but have mutations in a regulatory gene, known as the SMCHD1 gene, that normally contributes to the repression of the DUX4 gene via DNA methylation. 
 11


The figure below illustrates how genetic mutations in the D4Z4 repeat array (FSHD1) or the SMCHD1 gene (FSHD2) result in aberrant expression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle. 
 

Our Product Engine Identified the Drug Target for FSHD 
 We utilized patient-derived FSHD1 muscle cells, known as myotubes, and screened them with our small molecule probe library to identify drug targets that reduced DUX4 expression. We identified several potential drug targets, however the modulation of the majority of the targets adversely affected the health or differentiation of muscle cells. One drug target that we identified from our screening efforts for which we did not observe adverse cell health issues was p38α/ß, which had been studied extensively in other diseases, but had not been reported to be linked to DUX4 expression or FSHD until we conducted our screening efforts. We evaluated multiple small molecule p38α/ß inhibitors and observed a consistent reduction of both DUX4 expression and DUX4-driven gene transcripts with each p38α/ß inhibitor. We conducted further validation experiments to confirm that inhibition of p38α using genetic approaches such as siRNA and CRISPR single-guide RNAs, also led to a reduction in DUX4 expression. Additionally, researchers from Saint Louis University independently published the results of a study which concluded that inhibitors of p38α/ß, including losmapimod, suppressed DUX4 expression in cellular and animal FSHD models.
 Losmapimod 
 After identifying p38α/ß as a potential drug target, we evaluated multiple small molecule inhibitors of p38α/ß. Each of these inhibitors had previously been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of various diseases but never in muscle disorders. As a result of our evaluation and relative to other p38α/ß inhibitors, we identified losmapimod as the preferred development candidate based on substantial and attractive preclinical and clinical data regarding safety, PK and target inhibition, and its advanced stage of development. Losmapimod was originally evaluated by GSK in nearly 3,500 subjects in clinical trials across multiple indications and in multiple countries. GSK did not evaluate losmapimod in FSHD or in any other muscle disorder. Although GSK did not pursue regulatory approval in the indications evaluated, losmapimod demonstrated an attractive PK, PD, safety and tolerability profile, including in chronic dosing. 
 As shown in the figure on the left below, we observed in preclinical studies using losmapimod that inhibition of the p38α/ß pathway reduced DUX4 expression and downstream gene expression, as measured by the mRNA transcribed by MBD3L2, a gene that is only expressed following DUX4 activation. In the study, we demonstrated that MBD3L2 was representative of broader DUX4-driven gene expression changes in myotubes. We assessed the ability of losmapimod to inhibit p38α/ß by measuring the effect on the phosphorylation of a downstream protein called heat shock protein 27, or HSP27. The level of phosphorylation of HSP27 has been used in previous clinical trials, including by GSK, as a biomarker to measure the degree of p38α/ß inhibition. As shown in the figure on the right below, we also observed reduced cell death, or apoptosis, in FSHD myotubes, as measured by active caspase-3. We used active caspase-3 to quantify cell death because it is a protein that has been shown to be an important regulator of the apoptosis pathway in myotubes.

The dotted lines in each graphic above indicate the Cmin (left) and Cmax (right) observed in a clinical trial conducted by GSK that used a 15 mg twice per day dose of losmapimod. Cmin represents the minimum concentration in plasma prior to administration of a subsequent dose and Cmax represents the highest concentration in plasma after administration of a dose. 
 After identifying losmapimod, we in-licensed the molecule from GSK because we believed that its safety and pharmacology history would significantly expedite our development plan and enhance our future regulatory submissions. In February 2019, we obtained an exclusive worldwide license from GSK to the losmapimod patents and preclinical and clinical data for all indications, subject to certain conditions. This license includes a letter of reference for the FDA providing us the right to reference all the previous INDs that had been filed by GSK for losmapimod, as well as a license to their losmapimod data, including the original preclinical study and clinical trial reports. We also received active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and losmapimod tablets that had been manufactured by GSK. We are using the API and tablets to support our clinical development of losmapimod in FSHD, including our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials. We utilized the GSK data and our preclinical data to submit an IND in the United States and CTAs in Europe and Canada at various dates during 2019, which enabled us to advance our clinical development plan for losmapimod in FSHD, including initiating our randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter international Phase 2b clinical trial, or ReDUX4, and a single center Phase 2 open label trial in August 2019. The Phase 2b clinical trial and open label Phase 2 clinical trial completed enrollment in February 2020.
 Preclinical Development 
 We conducted several preclinical studies designed to evaluate the ability of losmapimod to reduce DUX4-driven gene expression. In a preclinical study of losmapimod, we treated myotubes from primary cell lines of eight FSHD1 and three FSHD2 patients for four days with different concentrations of losmapimod or vehicle as a negative control. To model the effect of losmapimod treatment on DUX4-driven gene expression across diverse disease-causing genotypes, we measured MBD3L2 transcript levels relative to the transcript levels of POLR2A, a gene whose expression is not regulated by DUX4 protein. We observed that clinically achievable concentrations of losmapimod (30 to 100 nM) decreased DUX4-driven expression by 50% to 65%, as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction amplification of the MBD3L2 transcripts. The observed treatment effect was similar in all cells tested regardless of genotype. We believe that this data suggests that losmapimod has the potential to treat FSHD patients across all genotypes. 
 The graphic below shows the least square mean estimates for DUX4-driven gene expression from 11 FSHD primary cells and healthy cells treated with losmapimod presented as mean and 95% confidence intervals, which demonstrates that losmapimod reduced DUX4-driven gene expression, as measured by MBD3L2 and POLR2A transcript levels in a concentration-dependent manner.

Reduction of DUX4-driven gene expression at increasing concentrations of losmapimod 
 

In our preclinical studies, we have also observed that treatment of FSHD patient-derived myotubes with losmapimod is highly specific for DUX4-driven gene expression. We conducted a study in which we measured the FSHD gene expression signature and observed a minimal impact on myogenesis when healthy human myotubes were treated with losmapimod. We treated FSHD cells with losmapimod for five days and a subsequent RNA-seq analysis revealed that only 89 transcripts (0.45%) out of approximately 20,000 protein coding genes were differentially expressed more than four-fold. Of these 89 differentially expressed transcripts, 90% were transcripts directly regulated by DUX4. We believe that this is strong evidence that the effects of losmapimod in affected skeletal muscle are highly specific for the treatment of the root cause of FSHD. Importantly, we did not observe changes in levels of myogenin, a transcriptional activator that promotes transcription of muscle-specific genes and plays a role in muscle differentiation, cell cycle exit and muscle atrophy, and observed minimal impact on other myogenic factors during myoblast differentiation into myotubes. 
 GSK observed concentrations of losmapimod in human plasma of 28.4 ng/mL to 74.1 ng/mL with an average of 50.5 ng/mL at a 15 mg twice per day dose in its clinical trials. In preclinical studies in animal models, we observed that losmapimod reached muscle tissue and engaged the p38α/ß target in the muscle tissue. As shown below, we detected similar concentrations of losmapimod in rat plasma and muscle, and significant target engagement is observed at concentrations that we expect to achieve in clinical trials using a 15 mg twice per day dose.

p38α/ß target engagement over time 
 

We obtained further evidence that losmapimod distributed to muscle from a preclinical study in which GSK profiled distribution of losmapimod to all tissues in rats. Our review of this data similarly confirmed that muscles were well exposed to losmapimod. 
 Clinical Development Overview 
 We began dosing in a Phase 1 clinical trial of losmapimod in healthy adult volunteers and patients with FSHD in Europe in February 2019 following the filing of a CTA in December 2018. We completed dosing in this trial in September 2019. In August 2019, we initiated a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter international Phase 2b clinical trial, ReDUX4, with 80 patients with FSHD to investigate whether oral administration of 15 mg of losmapimod twice per day reduces expression of DUX4-driven genes in affected skeletal muscle. In August 2019, we also initiated a single center open label Phase 2 clinical trial in up to 16 patients with FSHD to investigate the safety and tolerability of 15 mg losmapimod twice per day for chronic use and to evaluate the ability of losmapimod to reduce expression of DUX4-driven genes in affected skeletal muscle over varying durations of treatment. In addition, in February 2020 we initiated an open label extension of the ReDUX4 trial to enable patients in our ongoing Phase 2b clinical trial who are treated with losmapimod to continue receiving treatment after the 24-week or 48-week treatment period and to enable patients given placebo in our Phase 2b clinical trial to be treated with losmapimod.
 We believe that a 15 mg twice per day dose of losmapimod is an appropriate dose for the treatment of patients with FSHD based on previous clinical data and p38α/ß target engagement data generated by GSK and p38α/ß target engagement data from our preclinical studies. Results of PK in blood and losmapimod concentrations in skeletal muscle and target engagement in blood from the Phase 1 clinical trial in FSHD patients support the selection of the 15 mg twice per day dose of losmapimod for the ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials.
 We submitted a CTA in Europe for the open label Phase 2 clinical trial in April 2019 and submitted CTAs in Europe and Canada for the Phase 2b clinical trial at various dates during 2019. Each of the CTAs have been accepted.

The original design of ReDUX4 included a muscle biopsy at week 16 during the 24-week treatment period followed by an open label extension. Sixteen of the 80 subjects in trial have completed the 24-week treatment period and rolled over to the open label extension portion of the trial. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we extended the ReDUX4 treatment period from 24 to 48 weeks through a protocol amendment to ensure the safety of the subjects and to allow for the opportunity for a biopsy at week 16 as originally intended or at week 36. Approximately 64 subjects who did not complete the original 24-week treatment period continued in the 48-week treatment period in the randomized portion of the trial. The extension from 24 to 48 weeks also allows for a longer assessment in a placebo-controlled design of the skeletal muscle MRI secondary endpoint and the various exploratory clinical endpoints, such as reachable workspace, optimized time up and go test for FSHD, muscle function measures and patient reported outcomes. We expect to present full data from the trial in the second quarter of 2021. We believe that the amendment to the trial protocol provides flexibility to address the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and supports collection of efficacy and safety data to support continued discussions with regulatory agencies regarding potential registration strategies.
 In August 2020, we announced results from a pre-specified interim analysis of the primary endpoint of the ReDUX4 trial, which is the reduction from baseline of DUX4-driven gene expression in affected skeletal muscle after subjects have been treated with losmapimod or placebo. Secondary and exploratory endpoints were not assessed as part of this analysis. Results from the interim analysis in the first 29 randomized subjects indicate that DUX4-driven gene expression did not show a separation from placebo at 16 weeks. However, in a pre-specified sensitivity analysis, those with the highest pre-treatment DUX4-driven gene expression in their muscle biopsy sample showed a large reduction in DUX4-driven gene expression following treatment with losmapimod compared to placebo. The highest expressing muscle biopsies represent the top quartile of biopsies assessed based on baseline DUX4-driven gene expression.
 The interim results included an analysis of the first 29 subjects who completed their 16-week biopsy out of the 80 subjects enrolled. Pharmacokinetics, demographics and the primary endpoint were assessed. The interim analysis was not powered for statistical significance and did not include individual patient level data. Subjects were randomized to receive an oral dose of losmapimod 15mg (n=15) or placebo (n=14) twice per day. While results showed a significant reduction in DUX4-driven gene expression in the muscle biopsies of subjects whose baseline biopsy showed the highest levels of DUX4 gene expression (38-fold decrease with losmapimod, n=3, and 5.4 fold-decrease with placebo, n=5), the population level data analysis of the reduction in DUX4-driven gene expression from all 29 subjects did not show a separation of losmapimod from placebo (3.7 fold increase with losmapimod, n=15, and 2.8 fold increase with placebo, n=14). Results indicated that muscle biopsies within the higher range of DUX4-driven gene expression at baseline may be needed to observe a reduction.
 We believe that the safety data from GSK’s prior losmapimod clinical trials, together with safety and efficacy data from our Phase 1 and ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials, may enable us to apply for accelerated approval. We believe a treatment for FSHD may be eligible for accelerated approval because FSHD is a rare, slowly progressive and disabling disease with no approved treatments. We plan to discuss accelerated approval with regulatory agencies if we observe positive results in our Phase 2b clinical trial based on biomarker endpoints that we believe are likely to predict clinical benefit.
 We are also conducting or have completed, several preparatory non-drug studies to assess biomarker endpoints and clinical outcome assessments. In addition, we are participating in a natural history study that plans to follow 160 subjects with FSHD in the United States and 60 subjects in Europe over 18 months. Planned enrollment in this study was completed in December 2019. We are using data generated to date, and expect to utilize data generated in the future, from our non-drug studies and the natural history study to inform discussions with regulatory agencies and future clinical trial design. 
 In January 2020, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to losmapimod for the treatment of FSHD. In March 2020, the EMA granted orphan drug designation to losmapimod for the treatment of FSHD.
 Prior Clinical Development of Losmapimod by GSK 
 GSK conducted multiple Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials and one Phase 3 clinical trial of losmapimod, including in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, acute coronary syndrome and other cardiovascular diseases, neuropathic pain, major depression disorder, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Nearly 3,500 subjects in 24 trials were given losmapimod with single doses as high as 60 mg and repeated oral doses as high as 15 mg twice per day for up to 52 weeks. We plan to use a dose of 15 mg twice per day in our clinical trials of losmapimod in FSHD. GSK did not conduct a clinical trial of losmapimod in patients with FSHD or any other muscle disorder. 
 In clinical trials of losmapimod conducted by GSK, no significant differences were observed in the frequency of adverse events, or AEs, in subjects given losmapimod and subjects given placebo. GSK generally observed a similar frequency of serious adverse events, or SAEs, and deaths between patients given losmapimod and patients given placebo. These trials included extensive evaluation of the cardiovascular risk profile of losmapimod, including completion of an 
 16


evaluation of the potential to prolong corrected QT. GSK reported that there was no clinically relevant difference with regard to the occurrence of electrocardiogram abnormalities post-baseline or vital signs with losmapimod as compared to placebo. GSK did not identify a safety signal attributed to losmapimod in any of these trials. There were no SAEs reported in 14 of these 24 clinical trials of losmapimod. 
 The table below presents safety data from the largest placebo-controlled clinical trial of losmapimod, which was a Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome following a heart attack, in which over 1,700 patients were given 7.5 mg of losmapimod or placebo twice per day for 12 weeks and were followed for an additional 12 weeks. In this trial, GSK observed a similar proportion of AEs in the placebo group as compared to the losmapimod group. The data in the table below presents the SAEs reported by more than 0.5% of patients in any group in the trial through 24 weeks.

This table includes safety data from the second largest clinical trial of losmapimod, which was a placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of losmapimod in patients with COPD, in which 602 adult patients were given 2.5 mg, 7.5 mg or 15 mg of losmapimod or placebo twice per day for 24 weeks and were followed for an additional week. In this trial, GSK observed a similar proportion of AEs in the placebo group as compared to the losmapimod group. Additionally, in this trial there were three fatal SAEs in the placebo group due to severe exacerbation of COPD, acute myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism, one fatal SAE in the losmapimod 7.5 mg group due to acute myocardial infarction and associated pulmonary edema and two fatal SAEs in the 15 mg group due to respiratory failure and bilateral purulent pleuritis and mediastinitis. The most common SAE observed in the trial was exacerbation of COPD, which was experienced by eight subjects in the placebo group, six subjects in the losmapimod 2.5 mg group, two subjects in the losmapimod 7.5 mg group and three subjects in the losmapimod 15 mg group. Other SAEs in the placebo group included a liver event, eczema, leukoplakia, sinobronchitis and anxiety. Other SAEs in the losmapimod groups included two subjects with liver events, one subject with eczema and leukoplakia, one subject with pyrexia and one subject with pemphigoid. 
 In addition to the trials and data summarized above, GSK also conducted a placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial in which 184 adult patients with frequently exacerbating COPD were given 15 mg of losmapimod or placebo twice per day for up to 52 weeks. In this trial, the proportion of subjects with AEs and SAEs was higher in the losmapimod group than in the placebo group; there was one fatal SAE in the placebo group and three fatal SAEs in the losmapimod group, none of which was considered related to losmapimod. The data in the table below presents the SAEs reported in the trial.

In addition to the 24 trials conducted by GSK, another sponsor conducted a placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of losmapimod in which 73 subjects with COPD with cardiovascular manifestations were given 7.5 mg of losmapimod or placebo for 16 weeks. There were 36 subjects in the losmapimod group and 37 in the placebo group. In this trial, there were a total of six (17%) SAEs in the losmapimod group, consisting of exacerbations of COPD and pneumonia, and there was one (3%) SAE in the placebo group. 
 In prior studies, GSK observed that the p38α/ß target inhibition in humans was approximately 10%, 30% and 50% at trough and 40%, 60% and 70% at peak following twice per day doses of 2.5 mg, 7.5 mg and 15 mg, respectively. In addition, based on in vitro data from our studies in FSHD myotubes with losmapimod, we believe that the muscle exposures that we have achieved in rodents, which are similar to concentrations in human blood from the 15 mg twice per day dose, will result in robust p38α/ß target engagement and will reduce DUX4-driven gene expression in FSHD skeletal muscle by more than 50%. We believe that this data supports our determination that 15 mg of losmapimod twice per day is an appropriate dose for the treatment of patients with FSHD. 
 Our Clinical Development Strategy

There are currently one ongoing and three completed preparatory non-drug studies designed to inform molecular and imaging biomarker and clinical development efficacy endpoints for ongoing clinical trials of losmapimod in patients with FSHD.

Biomarker Preparatory Study (Fulcrum SRA 002-2018)
We designed this preparatory study to investigate, inform and optimize the DUX4-driven gene expression and MRI efficacy biomarker endpoints that are currently in use in Phase 2 clinical trials of losmapimod for the treatment of FSHD. We enrolled and evaluated 17 subjects at seven clinical sites.
 This preparatory study was designed to measure aberrant DUX4-driven gene expression in affected skeletal muscle via a subset of DUX4-driven gene transcripts in order to develop a molecular muscle endpoint designed to track the root cause of disease. We are using MRI to inform affected leg muscles selected for biopsy. Based on the results of this study, we believe that the DUX4-driven gene transcript measurement could be a primary endpoint in a clinical trial to support accelerated approval of losmapimod for FSHD. We are also using whole-body MRI scans one to three months apart to evaluate changes in skeletal muscle health (lean muscle tissue volume and muscle tissue infiltration and replacement by fat). 
 19


The subjects have clinical severity scores of two to four on the Ricci scale, which is the clinical impairment disability scale for patients with FSHD, where a zero indicates that a subject has no disability and five indicates that a subject is permanently dependent upon the use of a wheelchair for daily mobility activities. 
 We also are using other MRI-based measures as secondary endpoints in our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials of losmapimod. We believe that muscle pathology in skeletal muscles of patients with FSHD is predictive of muscle degradation and subsequent fat replacement. We are utilizing MRI-based endpoints to identify the level of muscle pathology and the overall fat content in muscles. MRI imaging sequences, which are settings of pulses and gradients, have been developed that enable an increased contrast between tissues of interest. We use a T2 MRI sequence to observe and quantify areas of high muscle water content, or muscle edema, which is a marker of muscle pathology. These areas have a higher T2 value than the background tissue. T2 provides information about the muscle’s physiological status, however it is not specific for muscle edema and may indicate other abnormal conditions in muscle tissue. We are using the Dixon MRI sequence, or the Dixon method, to quantify the fat content of muscles, which is a marker for muscle degradation. The Dixon method separates the signals from water and fat and the separated fat signal can then be utilized to determine the fat infiltration and fraction within the muscle. We are using these MRI-based approaches as additional efficacy endpoints in our Phase 2 open label trial and Phase 2b clinical trial to identify muscles with higher levels of muscle pathology for muscle biopsy, as evidenced by a higher signal in the T2 sequence, and muscle degradation, as evidenced by intermediate levels of muscle fat fraction determined using the Dixon method. 
 A third-party study found that these MRI techniques, when applied to FSHD skeletal muscles, were able to quantify the increase in muscle pathology, as measured by fat fraction, as determined using the Dixon method, over a 20-month period. In particular, skeletal muscles with severe muscle pathology, as determined by elevated T2 signal, demonstrated progressive worsening of fat fraction over this period. This effect was observed as early as six months. Skeletal muscles in patients with FSHD that had low muscle pathology, based on a low T2 signal, demonstrated both lower levels of fat fraction and slower fat fraction progression. We believe that these data suggest that fat fraction progression is higher in muscles with a higher level of muscle pathology as measured by T2, and support the usage of these MRI-based endpoints in our ongoing clinical trials of losmapimod for the treatment of FSHD. 
 Optimized Time Up and Go Test Preparatory Study (Fulcrum SRA 003-2018)
We evaluated a modified version of the classic time up and go, or classic TUG, test that we are optimizing as a clinical outcome assessment of mobility and ambulation, which we refer to as the FSHD-TUG test. The classic TUG test requires patients to get up from a chair, walk three meters, turn around, walk back to the chair and sit down. It was originally developed for clinical practice to assess mobility, balance, walking ability and fall risk in older adults prior to discharge from hospitalization and was used recently as a key secondary efficacy endpoint in a registration trial in multiple sclerosis in Europe. The classic TUG test is also one of the clinical outcome assessments in the ReSOLVE natural history study discussed below. 
 While we believe that the classic TUG test is a valid, reliable and objective test to quantify functional mobility in all age groups, we believe that a minor modification, asking patients to get up from a standardized bed, will be more appropriate for FSHD patients. We believe that the FSHD-TUG test may be more sensitive to measure treatment effects in patients with FSHD. Patients with FSHD generally have a difficult time rising from a chair and even more so from a recumbent position and this difficulty progresses over time. Patients with FSHD report that limitations in mobility and in the use of the shoulders and upper arms are the two most important areas of concern. The FSHD-TUG test may be a useful clinical outcome assessment endpoint for measurement of treatment effects of losmapimod on mobility. 
 We tested the FSHD-TUG test in comparison to the classic TUG test in a group of 22 subjects with FSHD and in 20 healthy volunteers who are age and gender matched. The subjects had clinical severity scores of one to four on the Ricci scale. We evaluated the subjects in five visits over approximately 12 months. In addition, 10 of these subjects were enrolled in a three-month sub-study to assess mobility at home using a touchless sensor and machine learning platform for health analytics. We believe that this sub-study will provide valuable information regarding how measures of mobility conducted during clinical visits compare to mobility in every-day setting in subject’s homes. We are analyzing the data from these studies to inform our ongoing Phase 2 trials of losmapimod for the treatment of FSHD.
 Direct Patient Input (Fulcrum SRA 004-2018)
We also obtained direct patient input into the design and feasibility of our Phase 2b clinical trial by having 79 patients with FSHD complete a survey based on their review of the proposed schedule of clinical assessments for the trial. The patients provided their views on their willingness to participate and any potential barriers to their participation in our then-planned Phase 2b clinical trial. We conducted these surveys during a face-to-face interview in clinics in the United States and France, via an internet survey for members of an FSHD registry in the United Kingdom and through in-person groups in Canada. This survey study provided us with the ability to refine the protocol for our ongoing Phase 2b clinical trial, if needed, and to inform the design of the long-term open label extension of the ReDUX4 trial to reflect the feedback from patients.

ReSOLVE Natural History Study
The Clinical Trial Readiness to Solve Barriers to Drug Development in FSHD, or ReSOLVE study, is an ongoing natural history study funded by the NIH to help identify the patient population, efficacy biomarker and clinical outcome assessments for future FSHD drug trials. The study is being coordinated by the University of Rochester and University of Kansas Medical Center and enrolled the first subject in April 2018. The study will follow up to 160 subjects for 24 months across a network of eight U.S. clinical centers and will evaluate multiple biomarkers and clinical outcome assessments that may be suitable for clinical trials and will evaluate patient selection criteria based on genetic, demographic or clinical characteristics. Three sites in the European Union have joined the ReSOLVE protocol and will follow 60 subjects for 24 months. We believe that the results of this natural history study will inform the design and implementation of clinical trials and will inform discussions with regulatory agencies. We also believe that this study may provide valuable insights into the timeline for disease progression and functional changes in FSHD in the absence of treatment. 
 In connection with the ReSOLVE study, we have funded the addition of a clinical outcome assessment, which we refer to as reachable work space, or RWS. RWS is an objective assessment of upper arm function in a quantitative manner by measuring arm and shoulder mobility with and without weights. A hallmark of FSHD progression is weakness in the shoulder muscles and upper arms that eventually leads to an inability of patients to lift their arms above their shoulders. The RWS assessments are analyzed by a central reader. We have provided standardized hardware, software, and testing conditions to evaluate RWS at eight sites that are part of the ReSOLVE study in the United States and at three European sites. Furthermore, the RWS assessment has been registered as medical device in the U.S., Canada and Europe.
 A recent third-party study assessed changes in RWS for 18 subjects with FSHD for up to five years. As illustrated in the figure below, the study concluded that the RWS measure is able to detect slow declines in upper extremity function in subjects with FSHD as early as 1 year. The study also found that the most notable declines in RWS were in above-the-shoulder level quadrants with no significant changes in lower quadrants and that RWS declined more significantly if the subjects wore 500-gram weights on their wrists. 
 

Clinical Trial: Phase 1
 We conducted a randomized Phase 1 clinical trial of losmapimod in healthy adult volunteers and patients with FSHD in Europe under a CTA that we filed in December 2018. The primary objective of the trial was to investigate the safety and tolerability of losmapimod in healthy volunteers and in FSHD patients. The secondary objective was to evaluate repeated dose PK, and target engagement in FSHD patients in blood and muscle. This trial completed dosing in September 2019 and we presented unblinded data in March 2020. 
 21


In the first cohort, 10 healthy volunteers were randomized to a single oral dose of 7.5 mg of losmapimod (n=8) followed by a single oral dose of 15 mg after a wash out period or to single oral dose placebo (n=2) in both dosing periods. In the second cohort, 15 FSHD patients were randomized and treated with placebo (n=3) or 7.5 mg of losmapimod (n=6) or 15 mg of losmapimod (n=6) taken orally twice daily for 14 days. The third cohort was open label with five FSHD patients treated with 15 mg of losmapimod twice daily for 14 days. Biopsies of normal appearing (second cohort) and actively involved (STIR+) muscle (third cohort) were performed at baseline and during treatment.
 Losmapimod was well tolerated with no serious adverse events reported. Similar tolerability, safety and PK were observed in healthy volunteers and patients with FSHD. Treatment with losmapimod demonstrated dose-dependent PK and target engagement in blood. FSHD patients treated with losmapimod also achieved dose-dependent concentrations in skeletal muscle, with a muscle to plasma exposure ratio of approximately 1:1. Evidence of dose-dependent target engagement was also observed in skeletal muscle. The losmapimod 15 mg dose taken orally twice daily demonstrated sustained drug concentrations that in preclinical models with human FSHD myotubes resulted in a robust reduction of DUX4-driven gene expression. These data support the selection of the 15 mg dose of losmapimod taken orally twice daily in our ongoing Phase 2b placebo-controlled clinical trial and Phase 2 open label clinical trial of losmapimod.
 

We manufactured the losmapimod capsules for this trial prior to our license agreement with GSK. For our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials, we are using losmapimod tablets that were manufactured by GSK. We confirmed that the PK of the losmapimod capsules were consistent with published data on the PK of the losmapimod tablets manufactured by GSK. We also confirmed that the p38α/ß target engagement in blood from our losmapimod capsules is consistent with the previous data on target engagement of the losmapimod tablets manufactured by GSK. 
 Clinical Trial: Phase 2b (ReDUX4)
 In August 2019, we initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter international Phase 2b clinical trial in 80 patients with FSHD1 and clinical severity scores of two to four on the Ricci scale. In this trial, we are evaluating treatment with 15 mg of losmapimod or placebo tablets twice per day over a 24 or 48-week period. Enrollment was completed in February 2020. Patients were randomized 1:1 between the treatment and placebo arms. The FDA accepted the IND for losmapimod in June 2019, and we also submitted CTAs at various dates during 2019 to conduct the trial at sites in Europe and Canada, all of which were accepted.  
 The primary endpoint is the reduction of DUX4-driven gene expression in affected skeletal muscle biopsies before treatment and after approximately 16 weeks or 36 weeks of treatment. We selected the number of patients to enroll in this trial based on the magnitude of reduction of DUX4-driven gene expression that we have observed in our preclinical studies using losmapimod concentrations similar to those measured when dosing with 15 mg twice per day in clinical trials completed by GSK. 
 Secondary endpoints of the trial include evaluation of safety and tolerability in FSHD patients, PK in blood, losmapimod concentration in skeletal muscle biopsies, p38α/ß target engagement in blood and in muscle biopsies, and efficacy on the whole-body skeletal muscle MRI biomarker. This trial also includes evaluation of exploratory efficacy endpoints including centrally read RWS, FSHD-TUG test and patient-reported outcomes and muscle strength measured by quantitative dynamometry and motor function ability measurements obtained by physical therapists. 
 22


The original design of ReDUX4 included a muscle biopsy at week 16 during the 24-week treatment period followed by an open label extension. Sixteen of the 80 subjects in trial have completed the 24-week treatment period and rolled over to the open label extension portion of the trial. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we extended the ReDUX4 treatment period from 24 to 48 weeks through a protocol amendment to ensure the safety of the subjects and to allow for the opportunity for a biopsy at week 16 as originally intended or at week 36. Approximately 64 subjects who did not complete the original 24-week treatment period continued in the 48-week treatment period in the randomized portion of the trial. The extension from 24 to 48 weeks also allows for a longer assessment in a placebo-controlled design of the skeletal muscle MRI secondary endpoint and the various exploratory clinical endpoints, such as reachable workspace, optimized time up and go test for FSHD, muscle function measures and patient reported outcomes. We expect to present full data from the trial in the second quarter of 2021. We believe that the amendment to the trial protocol provides flexibility to address the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and supports collection of efficacy and safety data to support continued discussions with regulatory agencies regarding potential registration strategies.
The graphic below presents the design of the Phase 2b clinical trial.
 

In August 2020, we announced results from a pre-specified interim analysis of the primary endpoint of the ReDUX4 trial, which is the reduction from baseline of DUX4-driven gene expression in affected skeletal muscle after subjects have been treated with losmapimod or placebo. Secondary and exploratory endpoints were not assessed as part of this analysis. Results from the interim analysis in the first 29 randomized subjects indicate that DUX4-driven gene expression did not show a separation from placebo at 16 weeks. However, in a pre-specified sensitivity analysis, those with the highest pre-treatment DUX4-driven gene expression in their muscle biopsy sample showed a large reduction in DUX4-driven gene expression following treatment with losmapimod compared to placebo. The highest expressing muscle biopsies represent the top quartile of biopsies assessed based on baseline DUX4-driven gene expression.
 The interim results included an analysis of the first 29 subjects who completed their 16-week biopsy out of the 80 subjects enrolled. Pharmacokinetics, demographics and the primary endpoint were assessed. The interim analysis was not powered for statistical significance and did not include individual patient level data. Subjects were randomized to receive an oral dose of losmapimod 15mg (n=15) or placebo (n=14) twice per day. While results showed a significant reduction in DUX4-driven gene expression in the muscle biopsies of subjects whose baseline biopsy showed the highest levels of DUX4 gene expression (38-fold decrease with losmapimod, n=3, and 5.4 fold-decrease with placebo, n=5), the population level data analysis of the reduction in DUX4-driven gene expression from all 29 subjects did not show a separation of losmapimod from placebo (3.7 fold increase with losmapimod, n=15, and 2.8 fold increase with placebo, n=14). Results indicated that muscle biopsies within the higher range of DUX4-driven gene expression at baseline may be needed to observe a reduction. These interim results are shown in the graphics below.

Clinical Trial: ReDUX4 Open Label Extension
 In February 2020 we initiated an open label extension of the ReDUX4 trial to enable patients who have completed the 24-week or 48-week treatment period with losmapimod or placebo in ReDUX4 to receive long term treatment with losmapimod. This open label extension includes clinical assessments of safety and efficacy every three months, whole-body musculoskeletal MRI every six months, and a muscle needle biopsy once after six months of treatment. We anticipate that this trial will continue until such time as the drug is approved and available in the commercial setting or the clinical development of losmapimod in FSHD is terminated.
Clinical Trial: Phase 2 Open Label Study Trial
 In parallel with the Phase 2b clinical trial, we also initiated in August 2019 an open label, single center Phase 2 clinical trial of losmapimod in up to 16 patients with FSHD1 and clinical severity scores of two to four on the Ricci scale. Patients receive tablets containing 15 mg of losmapimod twice per day for up to 52 weeks. The treatment period is preceded by eight weeks of pre-treatment assessments to establish a baseline for musculoskeletal MRI biomarkers and clinical outcome assessments. We also performed an outpatient mobility assessment using wearable sensors. We are conducting the trial at a single center in the Netherlands. 
 The primary objective is to investigate the safety and tolerability of losmapimod for chronic dosing in FSHD patients. The primary endpoints are to assess safety and tolerability over the 52-week period. The secondary endpoints are the change from baseline in pHSP27 and the ratio of pHSP27 to total HSP27 in blood and muscle for assessment of the inhibition of p38α/ß during the dosing period. This trial is also designed to provide initial data regarding changes in DUX4-driven gene expression, MRI biomarkers, objective clinical outcome assessments and patient-reported outcomes that may occur at various times following initiation of treatment with losmapimod relative to the pre-treatment period. We intend to use this data to further guide our clinical development strategy for losmapimod in FSHD. 
 We will measure DUX4-driven gene expression before and during treatment using muscle needle biopsies in affected muscles. All patients had a pre-treatment biopsy and we will obtain a second muscle needle biopsy from each patient after four or eight weeks of treatment. The original trial design included an additional biopsy during chronic treatment at week 48, but we have removed this assessment from the trial protocol because the open label extension of ReDUX4 includes a biopsy during chronic treatment.
 We will measure potential losmapimod treatment effects on shoulder and upper arm function and mobility/ambulation, as well as on muscle strength and function and quality of life and activities of daily living, similar to the assessments in the Phase 2b clinical trial. The clinical outcome assessments are RWS, FSHD-TUG, muscle strength, motor function ability and generic and FSHD-specific patient reports of quality of life and activities of daily living. Other exploratory assessments include the six minute walk test, spirometry, and muscle ultrasound. There is also an assessment of day-to-day mobility using wearable sensors.

Market Research 
 We engaged Clarion Healthcare, LLC to conduct market research with physicians and payors to better understand the commercial landscape and to assist in our commercial planning. A total of 14 physicians in the United States, European Union and Asia and nine payors and payor experts in the United States and European Union were surveyed. Both groups acknowledged the severity of the disease and lack of any existing therapies for patients. Physicians were asked their views on potentially prescribing a small molecule product candidate that effectively repressed DUX4 gene expression in skeletal muscle and resulted in the preservation of muscle function. Based on an April 2018 report prepared by Clarion, we believe that physicians would be receptive to prescribing a product with these qualities, subject to the efficacy and safety of the product, due to the chronic nature of the disease.
Our Product Candidate for Hemoglobinopathies 
 Hemoglobinopathies are a category of genetic disorders affecting RBCs. We intend to develop FTX-6058 to elevate the level of fetal hemoglobin for the treatment of patients with certain hemoglobinopathies, namely sickle cell disease and for certain types of ß-thalassemia. 
Overview of Sickle Cell Disease 
 Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder of RBCs. SCD patients typically suffer from serious clinical consequences, which may include vaso-occlusive crises, anemia, pain, infections, stroke, heart disease, pulmonary hypertension, kidney failure, liver disease and reduced life expectancy. According to a study published by the American Medical Association, approximately 32.5% of adult patients with SCD were hospitalized three or more times per year due to pain crises. SCD is reported to shorten patient life expectancy by approximately 20 to 30 years. Patients with SCD are primarily treated by hematologists. 
 In the United States, where newborn screening for SCD is mandatory, the estimated prevalence is approximately 100,000 individuals. In Europe, the estimated prevalence is approximately 134,000 individuals according to the EMA. According to the World Health Organization, the global incidence is estimated to be approximately 300,000 births annually. SCD is most prevalent in Africa and the Middle East. 
 Approved drug treatments for SCD focus primarily on the management and reduction of pain episodes, vaso-occlusive crises, and inhibition of hemoglobin S polymerization. The four drug treatments approved in the United States are hydroxyurea, voxelotor, crizanlizumab, and L-glutamine. Hydroxyurea is approved for the treatment of anemia related to SCD to reduce the frequency of painful crises and the need for blood transfusions. Hydroxyurea has a black box warning for myelosuppression and malignancy. In general, it is limited by its adverse side effects, inconsistent patient responses and concerns regarding the cytotoxic effect of the drug. L-glutamine is approved to reduce severe complications associated with the disorder. Voxelotor, marketed by Global Blood Therapeutics, is approved under accelerated approval as a hemoglobin polymerization inhibitor. Crizanlizumab, marketed by Novartis AG, or Novartis, is approved for the reduction in the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises. 
 25


Blood transfusions can be utilized to decrease the sickling of RBCs. While blood transfusions can be critical to manage SCD, there are a number of limitations associated with this therapeutic approach, including limited patient access and serious complications such as iron overload. The only potentially curative treatment currently approved for severe SCD is bone marrow transplantation. However, this treatment option is not commonly used due to the difficulties of finding a suitable matching donor and the risks associated with the treatment, which include an approximately 5% mortality rate. Bone marrow transplantation is more commonly offered to pediatric patients with available sibling-matched donors. 
 While multiple experimental approaches to treat SCD are being explored in clinical trials, the majority are focused on symptomatic relief or gene therapy approaches. Symptomatic approaches under investigation aim to affect issues associated with cell adhesion, sickling, thrombosis and iron homeostasis. We anticipate that a novel orally available therapy that affects the root cause of SCD may be used in combination with symptomatic therapeutics. Novartis and Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc. have received approval for therapies aiming to provide symptomatic relief for patients with SCD. Several gene therapy approaches to treat SCD are focused on elevating fetal hemoglobin, however no gene therapy approaches have been approved for SCD and the efficacy, safety and durability of gene therapy approaches have yet to be established. Gene therapies need to be administered in an in-patient procedure through a bone marrow transplant, which is also referred to as a stem cell transplant or hematopoietic stem cell transplant. As part of the transplant process, the patient receives myeloablative chemotherapy which kills cells in the bone marrow in order to support the gene therapy. Despite ongoing efforts to develop gene therapies for SCD, we believe there is still a high unmet need that could be better addressed by a small molecule, oral therapy to treat the disease by increasing fetal hemoglobin. 
 SCD Biology
SCD is caused by a mutation in the HBB gene. This gene encodes a protein that is a key component of hemoglobin, a protein complex whose function is to transport oxygen in the body. Hemoglobin in adults is a complex of four proteins, two hemoglobin ß-subunits and two hemoglobin α-subunits. In patients with SCD, hemoglobin is composed of two mutant ß-subunits and two α-subunits and the result is the formation of abnormal hemoglobin. The result of the mutation is less efficient oxygen transport and the formation of RBCs that have a sickle shape. These sickle shaped cells are much less flexible than healthy cells and can block blood vessels (vaso-occlusion) or rupture cells (lysis), leading to pain, anemia, irreversible organ damage or even death. 
 During fetal development, the major form of hemoglobin is fetal hemoglobin. Similar to hemoglobin in adults, fetal hemoglobin is also a complex of four proteins, two α-subunits and two γ-subunits. Shortly after birth, the genes encoding the γ-subunits, the HBG1 and HBG2 genes, are silenced and the HBB gene is activated. As described above, SCD is caused by a mutation in the HBB gene that gives rise to mutated ß-subunits. 
 A small subset of individuals with the sickle cell mutation continue to produce high levels of fetal hemoglobin due to inheritance of additional genetic mutations, which is called Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin, or HPFH. Patients with elevated fetal hemoglobin exhibit few, if any, clinical manifestations of SCD. Further, an increase of fetal hemoglobin as low as 3% over baseline in patients without HPFH, due to either therapeutic intervention or the inheritance of other genetic traits, can result in reduced clinical manifestations of the disease. 
 

26


Our Approach to Address the Root Cause of SCD
Our strategy to address the root cause of SCD was to identify a drug mechanism that induces expression of fetal hemoglobin. We believe that FTX-6058 may address the root cause of SCD through this mechanism of action. 
 Overview of ß-Thalassemia 
 ß-thalassemia is a rare blood disorder associated with the absence or reduced production of ß-globin, which is one of the two proteins that comprise adult hemoglobin. This results in an abnormally low level of hemoglobin as well as an excess of α-globin chains that cause destruction of RBCs. The severity of the phenotype is related to the degree of imbalance between α- and non-α-globin chain synthesis. The absence of ß-globin due to HBB gene deletions is referred to as ß0 thalassemia. Other HBB gene alterations allow some ß-globin to be produced but in reduced amounts. A reduced amount of ß-globin is called ß+thalassemia. Many patients with ß-thalassemia require chronic blood transfusions due to severe anemia that results from low hemoglobin levels, which are referred to as transfusion-dependent patients. It is estimated that 40,000 babies are born worldwide with ß-thalassemia per year of whom 25,000 require blood transfusions. Patients with ß-thalassemia are primarily treated by hematologists. 
 ß-thalassemia has been clinically characterized into three forms, depending on disease severity: major, intermedia and minor. The most severe form, ß-thalassemia major (also known as Cooley’s anemia), is generally diagnosed shortly after birth and patients have life-threatening anemia. Pediatric patients do not grow and gain weight at the typical rates, and often have liver, heart and bone problems. Many ß-thalassemia major patients require frequent blood transfusions to prevent severe anemia, a treatment that itself can cause long-term problems due to a build-up of iron in the body. ß-thalassemia intermedia is a less severe form of the disease that results in mild to moderate anemia. These patients sometimes require blood transfusions depending on the severity of the symptoms. Patients with ß-thalassemia minor suffer from very mild anemia and generally do not require treatment. Having either ß0 or ß+ thalassemia does not necessarily predict clinical disease severity as people with both types have been diagnosed with thalassemia major and thalassemia intermedia. Any increase in fetal hemoglobin has the potential to ameliorate the disease. 
 The current standard of care for many patients with ß-thalassemia is frequent blood transfusions to manage anemia. The only potentially curative therapy for ß-thalassemia is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, which is associated with risks of complications, including mortality, and is limited to patients with a suitable donor. The European Commission granted conditional marketing authorization for ZYNTEGLO, a gene therapy developed by bluebird bio, Inc., or bluebird, for the treatment of adult and adolescent patients with transfusion-dependent ß-thalassemia and with certain genotypes, in Europe in June 2019. bluebird has initiated a rolling biologics license application, or BLA, submission for betibeglogene autotemcel in the United States, which is expected to be completed in mid-2021. Acceleron in collaboration with Celgene Corp., or Celgene, received FDA and EMA approval for luspatercept, an erythroid maturation agent for the treatment of adult patients with anemia associated with ß-thalassemia and who require frequent transfusions. There are also multiple other experimental approaches to treat ß-thalassemia being explored in clinical trials, including approaches that use small molecule, gene therapy and gene editing approaches. Despite ongoing efforts to develop new therapies for ß-thalassemia, we believe there is still a high unmet need that could be addressed by a small molecule, oral therapy to treatment the disease by increasing fetal hemoglobin. 
 Biology of ß-Thalassemia
ß-thalassemia is caused by genetic mutations in the HBB gene. The mutations interfere with the production of ß-globin. Some mutations result in no ß-globin being produced, while other mutations result in a decreased amount of ß-globin being produced. 
 Our Approach to Address the Root Cause of ß-Thalassemia
We believe that some types of ß-thalassemia may be treated by a therapy that upregulates fetal hemoglobin. Babies born with ß-thalassemia major generally do not have any symptoms shortly after birth because they have fetal hemoglobin in their blood. As the fetal hemoglobin levels decrease after birth and the ß-globin fails to increase, anemia appears and the babies with ß-thalassemia begin to exhibit symptoms of the disease. Patients with ß-thalassemia intermedia that have higher levels of fetal hemoglobin have fewer symptoms than patients with low levels of fetal hemoglobin. We believe that FTX-6058 may be suitable for clinical development for the treatment of patients who are not ß0 but who are transfusion dependent.

Our Product Engine Identified the Drug Target for SCD and ß-Thalassemia 
 Applying our product engine, we conducted target identification and validation activities using human umbilical cord blood-derived erythroid progenitor 2, or HUDEP2, cells as a model to study fetal hemoglobin reactivation. HUDEP2 cells are immature RBCs. By screening our small molecule probe library and a CRISPR library, we identified several potential drug targets that activated the HBG1/2 genes and resulted in fetal hemoglobin elevation. Each screening approach identified the same protein complex which we believe plays an important role in the expression of genes responsible for the production of fetal hemoglobin. We conducted additional validation experiments in which we observed that inhibition of several components of this complex resulted in the desired elevation of fetal hemoglobin. We also observed that inhibition of these components did not adversely affect important cell health markers. 
 We selected a member of this protein complex for drug discovery activities following an assessment of its tractability as a drug target, which we refer to as the HbF drug target. The normal physiological role of the HbF drug target is to facilitate a post-translational protein modification, and the goal of our medicinal chemistry program was to optimize inhibitors of the HbF drug target. We developed in vitro and in vivo target engagement assays, as well as enabled X-ray crystallography, to discover and develop FTX-6058, a novel small molecule inhibitor of the HbF drug target. 
 FTX-6058 
 FTX-6058 is our novel small molecule designed to bind EED and inhibit the transcriptional silencing activity of PRC2. FTX-6058 exhibits fetal hemoglobin induction and possesses properties that we believe are well aligned with preferred parameters for oral drug delivery. We studied the cellular potency and the PK data of FTX-6058 in preclinical animal models and observed that its profile supports once daily oral administration. We have not observed any off-target concerns in our in vitro profiling studies, and we have completed GLP in vivo toxicology studies to evaluate FTX-6058. We initiated our Phase 1 clinical trial of FTX-6058 in healthy adult volunteers in the fourth quarter of 2020. In addition, we anticipate initiating a clinical trial of FTX-6058 in patients with SCD in the second half of 2021.
 Preclinical Studies 
 We have observed in vitro and in vivo activation of the HBG1/2 genes in preclinical studies with FTX-6058. We observed that FTX-6058 elevated levels of fetal hemoglobin with minimal adverse effects on important cellular health markers. As depicted in the graphic below, we also observed in vitro upregulation of fetal hemoglobin in primary human CD34+ cells differentiated into RBCs from five different healthy human donors and one SCD donor after seven days of drug treatment. FTX-6058 showed a significant elevation of fetal hemoglobin over baseline in each of these six donor cell lines. We have conducted additional preclinical profiling in CD34+ derived cells and observed that treatment with FTX-6058 increased HbF levels to approximately 30% of total hemoglobin, as measured by mass spectrometry, high performance liquid chromatography, and fast protein liquid chromatography techniques. The elevation of HbF observed with FTX-6058 was significantly greater than we observed with hydroxyurea in these cell models.

 in differentiated primary human CD34+ cells

Additionally, we compared the effect of FTX-6058 in CD34+ derived cells relative to that of hydroxyurea. We observed that hydroxyurea had a minimal impact on fetal hemoglobin elevation, whereas we observed that FTX-6058 significantly elevated fetal hemoglobin. In cells treated with the combination of FTX-6058 and hydroxyurea, we observed an increased effect relative to either compound alone.
 In preclinical PK/PD studies in mice, we observed that blood cells had dose-dependent drug target engagement after 4.5 days of oral treatment of FTX-6058. FTX-6058 inhibited activity of PRC2, which is responsible for catalyzing tri-methylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3). As a result, target engagement was assessed by quantifying H3K27me3 levels. We believe our drug target is conserved between species, which is supported by our observation of a concomitant upregulation of the mouse embryonic globin gene under conditions where we observed drug target engagement. Since mice do not have the HBG1/2 genes found in humans, we used the mouse embryonic globin gene hbb-bh1 as a surrogate for the human HBG1/2 genes. We measured the target engagement in the mouse from whole blood. We concluded from the data that FTX-6058 engaged the drug target in vivo and modulated the endogenous mouse globin gene expression program. The results of this study are depicted below. 
 
 
Target engagement modification in mouse blood cells | Mouse embryonic globin mRNA levels
----------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------

 


In the graphic on the left, we measured the amount of drug target engagement modification in mouse blood cells after five days of treatment. In the vehicle-treated mice, we observed maximum levels of protein modification, whereas in the FTX-6058 treated mice, we observed significantly lower levels of modification, which indicates significant target engagement. Each point represents the value for a different mouse, shown as a percent of the average vehicle-treated value. In the graphic on the right, we determined the level of mouse embryonic globin mRNA levels in mouse blood after five days of treatment. The data is from an average of four or five mice per treatment. In these studies, we used a conventional method of assessing statistical significance known as a two-tailed test. The p-value for each of the studies depicted above was 0.0005. A p-value is a conventional statistical method for measuring the statistical significance of experimental results. A p-value of less than 0.05 is generally considered to represent statistical significance, meaning that there is a less than five percent likelihood that the observed results occurred by chance. 
 29


Additionally, we studied FTX-6058 in a mouse model of SCD, known as the Townes mouse model. In this model, mouse globin genes have been replaced with human globin genes, thereby allowing investigations of mechanisms that may regulate human hemoglobin gene expression. The Townes mouse model has been widely used to study potential treatments for SCD. As shown in the figures below, we observed that FTX-6058 resulted in a significant increase in fetal hemoglobin expressing cells, or F-cells, and HbF protein levels after 13 days of dosing at 5 mg/kg once per day whereas hydroxyurea resulted in modest increases in F-cells and HbF. 
 
 
Percentage of F-cells in Townes mice treated with FTX-6058 | HbF protein levels in Townes mice treated with FTX-6058

 In the graphic on the left, we quantified the percentage of F-cells as a percentage of total cells (%F-cells) for the three treatment conditions from mouse blood, shown as a percentage of vehicle-alone-treated SCD mice. In the graphic on the right, we determined the level of human HbF protein for the three treatment conditions, quantifying HbF protein as a percentage of total hemoglobin. Each value represents the mean value from eight mice per treatment after 13 days of treatment. In these studies, we used a conventional method of assessing statistical significance known as a one-way analysis of variance, or ANOVA. The p-value for FTX-6058 was less than 0.001 for both studies and the p-value for hydroxyurea in the study depicted on the right was less than 0.01.
 Our Development Plan for FTX-6058 
 We initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of FTX-6058 in the fourth quarter of 2020 to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of FTX-6058 in healthy adult volunteers. 
 The Phase 1 clinical trial of FTX-6058 in healthy adult volunteers is comprised of four parts. Part A is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study in up to six cohorts. Part B is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose study in up to four cohorts dosed once daily for 14 days. Part C is an open label pilot food effect study in subjects randomized to take FTX-6058 with and without a high-fat meal, and Part D is an open label study to evaluate the potential of FTX-6058 to induce a liver enzyme known as CYP3A, which is involved in drug metabolism. We expect to present data from the Phase 1 clinical trial in mid-2021.
 In addition, we anticipate initiating a clinical trial of FTX-6058 in patients with SCD in the second half of 2021.
 We expect that our target SCD patient population will be SCD patients with inadequate disease control and that concomitant use of hydroxyurea and/or L-glutamine will be allowed when available. We also expect to evaluate FTX-6058 in clinical trials for the treatment of ß-thalassemia.

Discovery Screening Programs 
 We have leveraged our proprietary product engine to discover targets that we are pursuing with small molecules for FSHD, SCD and ß-thalassemia. We are leveraging the broad applicability of our product engine to discover drug targets for other rare, genetically defined diseases across neuromuscular, muscular, hematologic and CNS disorders.
 

Our target identification strategy and approach continue to evolve. In addition to conducting screens to identify targets that modulate the expression of a single root cause gene, we are able to simultaneously interrogate multiple (approximately 10) root cause genes and to monitor effects on cell health all in a single screen (i.e., multiplexed screening). We believe that this new approach provides significant efficiencies in productivity and allows us to test multiple hypotheses in parallel. Importantly, the expansion of FulcrumSeek with the use of high content molecular profiling, including RNAseq and cellular imaging, allows us to simultaneously measure the expression of 8,000-10,000 genes and integrate key measures related to cell health and biology, which enables us to scale our screening capacity and productivity. With the use of our small molecule probe library and our functional genomics capabilities, we aim to conduct target identification at a significantly increased scale and with cost-effectiveness. Moreover, we are using our product engine in hypothesis testing mode and in hypothesis generation mode, which we expect to increase the probability of identifying attractive targets to advance in our portfolio or in collaboration with partners.
 Right of Reference and License Agreement with GlaxoSmithKline 
 In February 2019, we entered into a right of reference and license agreement with affiliates of GSK, as amended in September 2020, pursuant to which GSK granted us a right of reference to certain INDs filed with the FDA and controlled by GSK or its affiliates relating to losmapimod and an exclusive worldwide license under certain patent rights related to losmapimod. The agreement also provides us with an exclusive worldwide license to certain of GSK’s preclinical and clinical data with respect to losmapimod. As partial consideration for the right of reference and licenses granted under the agreement, we issued 12,500,000 shares of our Series B preferred stock to GSK at the time we entered into the reference and license agreement. The agreement obligates us to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a licensed product for the treatment of FSHD. 
 The agreement grants us an exclusive, sublicensable license under the licensed patent rights and data rights to research, develop and commercialize losmapimod or any product containing losmapimod as an API, which we refer to as a licensed product, to treat disease in humans. GSK retained the right, without the right to grant sublicenses, to conduct nonclinical research under the licensed patents and data rights and, with our consent, GSK may engage in certain developmental activities relating to the use of a licensed product in connection with a specified prophylactic use. GSK also agreed to and has since transferred to us its existing manufactured supply of losmapimod. 
 Under the agreement, we will be obligated to make milestone payments to GSK aggregating up to $37.5 million upon the achievement of specified clinical and regulatory milestones with respect to the first licensed product to achieve such milestones, including a $2.5 million milestone payment we made to GSK during the year ended December 31, 2019 upon the imitation of a Phase 2 clinical trial, and up to $60.0 million upon the achievement of one-time aggregate annual worldwide net sales milestones. We will also be obligated to pay royalties ranging from a mid single-digit percentage to a low double-digit, but less than teens, percentage to GSK based on our, and any of our affiliates’ and sublicensees’, annual net sales of licensed products. The royalties are payable on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, and may be reduced in specified circumstances. 
 31


Our obligation to make royalty payments extends with respect to a licensed product in a country until the earlier of the approval of a generic version of such licensed product by the applicable regulatory agency in such country or the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country, which we refer to as the royalty term. Following the expiration of any exclusive marketing rights or data exclusivity rights granted by a regulatory authority, other than patent rights, for any licensed product on a country-by-country basis, the applicable royalty rate will be reduced. Additionally, if we or our affiliates or sublicensees determine that it is necessary to obtain a license from a third party under any patent rights to exploit a licensed product in a country, then we may deduct a certain percentage of the license fees under such third party license payable by us to the third party from the royalty payment that would otherwise be due to GSK in such country. 
 If, prior to our completion of the first Phase 2 clinical trial for a licensed product, we wish to sublicense any of the licensed patent or data rights granted to us under the agreement to any third party outside of the United States, we must notify GSK of the terms on which we propose to grant such sublicense. GSK has the right to enter into negotiations with us for such sublicense, and if GSK so elects, then we must negotiate in good faith with GSK for a prescribed period. If we and GSK do not agree to a sublicense of the relevant rights, we may sublicense the relevant rights to the third party on terms no less favorable than any terms offered to us by GSK. 
 The agreement continues on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis until the expiration of the royalty term in each country, at which time the agreement expires with respect to such licensed product in such country and we shall have a fully-paid up, royalty-free and perpetual license to the licensed patent rights and data with respect to such licensed product in such country. Either party has the right to terminate the agreement if the other party has materially breached in the performance of its obligations under the agreement and such breach has not been cured within the applicable cure period. 
 Collaboration and License Agreement with Acceleron
 In December 2019, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Acceleron to identify biological targets to modulate specific pathways associated with a targeted indication within the pulmonary disease space. Under the terms of the collaboration and license agreement, we granted Acceleron an exclusive worldwide license under certain intellectual property rights to make, have made, use, sell, have sold, import, export, distribute and have distributed, market, have marketed, promote, have promoted, or otherwise exploit molecules and products directed against or expressing certain biological targets identified by us for the treatment, prophylaxis, or diagnosis of a targeted indication within the pulmonary disease space, or the Indication.
 Pursuant to a mutually agreed research plan, we will perform assay screening and related research activities to identify and validate potential biological targets for further research, in order to support the development, manufacture and commercialization of product candidates by Acceleron. Upon completion of the research activities, we will deliver a data package to Acceleron with respect to the biological targets identified by us in the conduct of the research activities for the treatment, prophylaxis, or diagnosis of the Indication. Within a designated period of receipt of the data package, Acceleron will have the right to designate a specified number of the biological targets identified by us for Acceleron’s research, development, manufacture and commercialization of products or molecules directed to such targets for the treatment, prophylaxis, or diagnosis of the Indication, or the Targets. If Acceleron does not designate any Targets during the designated period, then the agreement will automatically terminate. If Acceleron designates one or more Targets, then Acceleron will be obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to seek regulatory approval for one product directed to a Target in certain specified countries. Upon receipt of regulatory approval for any product directed to a Target, Acceleron must use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize such product in certain specified countries. 
 While we are performing the research activities pursuant to the research plan and for a specified period thereafter, we may not research, develop, manufacture, commercialize, use, or otherwise exploit any compound or product for the treatment, prophylaxis, or diagnosis of the Indication other than for Acceleron. While we are performing the research activities pursuant to the research plan and for a specified period thereafter, other than for Acceleron, we may not research, develop, manufacture, commercialize, use, or otherwise exploit any compound or product for the treatment, prophylaxis, or diagnosis of the Indication that is directed against certain specified biological targets identified by us in the performance of the research activities. 
 Acceleron may also request that we perform medicinal chemistry services related to the generation and optimization of molecules directed against or expressing biological targets for the treatment, prophylaxis, or diagnosis of the Indication beyond the scope of the research plan. If we agree to provide such medicinal chemistry services, we and Acceleron will negotiate to determine the scope, timeline and budget for such medicinal chemistry services. 
 32


Under the agreement, Acceleron made a $10.0 million upfront payment to us. We will be entitled to research milestone payments of up to $18.5 million in the aggregate upon achievement of specified research milestones. Additionally, we will be entitled to development milestone payments of up to $135.0 million in the aggregate upon the first achievement of specified clinical and regulatory milestones by a product directed to a Target, and up to $67.5 million in the aggregate upon the second achievement of specified clinical and regulatory milestones by a product directed to a Target. We will also be entitled to sales milestone payments of up to $145.0 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of one-time aggregate annual worldwide net sales milestones for the first product directed to a Target to achieve such milestones, and up to $72.5 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of one-time aggregate annual worldwide net sales milestones for the second product directed to a Target to achieve such milestones. To date, we have achieved $2.0 million of specified research milestones. Acceleron will also pay us tiered royalties ranging from a mid single-digit percentage to a low double-digit percentage based on Acceleron’s, and any of its affiliates’ and sublicensees’, annual worldwide net sales of products directed to any Target. The royalties are payable on a product-by-product basis during a specified royalty term, and may be reduced in specified circumstances. 
 The agreement continues on a country-by-country and Target-by-Target basis until the last to expire royalty term for a product directed to such Target, at which time the agreement expires with respect to such Target in such country. Either party has the right to terminate the agreement if the other party has materially breached in the performance of its obligations under the agreement and such breach has not been cured within the applicable cure period. Acceleron also has the right to terminate the agreement for convenience in its entirety or on a Target-by-Target and molecule-by-molecule basis with respect to any molecule directed against a Target. 
 Collaboration and License Agreement with MyoKardia, a wholly owned subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company
 In July 2019, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with MyoKardia, or the MyoKardia Collaboration Agreement, to identify biological targets that are capable of modulating genes of interest with relevance to certain genetically defined cardiomyopathies. Under the terms of the MyoKardia Collaboration Agreement, we granted MyoKardia an exclusive worldwide license under certain intellectual property rights to research, develop, make, have made, use, have used, sell, have sold, offer for sale, have offered for sale, import, have imported, export, have exported, distribute, have distributed, market, have marketed, promote, have promoted, or otherwise exploit products directed against certain biological targets identified by us that are capable of modulating certain genes of interest with relevance to certain genetically defined cardiomyopathies.
 Pursuant to a mutually agreed research plan, we will perform assay screening and related research activities to identify and validate up to a specified number of potential cardiomyopathy gene targets, or the Identified Targets, for further research, development, manufacture and commercialization by MyoKardia. We and MyoKardia will work together to determine how best to advance at each stage of the research activities under the research plan and to identify which of the Identified Targets, if any, meet the criteria set forth in the research plan, or the Cardiomyopathy Target Candidates. Upon completion of the research plan, the parties will work together to prepare a final data package and MyoKardia may designate certain Cardiomyopathy Target Candidates for MyoKardia’s further exploitation under the MyoKardia Collaboration Agreement, or the Cardiomyopathy Targets. If MyoKardia does not designate any Cardiomyopathy Targets during the designated period, then the MyoKardia Collaboration Agreement will automatically terminate. If MyoKardia designates one or more Cardiomyopathy Targets, then MyoKardia will be obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to seek regulatory approval for and to commercialize one product directed against an Identified Target in certain specified countries. 
 During the period in which we are performing the research activities pursuant to the research plan, or the Research Term and for a specified period beyond the Research Term if MyoKardia designates a Cardiomyopathy Target, we may only use the data generated from such research activities for MyoKardia in accordance with the MyoKardia Collaboration Agreement. During the Research Term and for a specified period thereafter, we may not research, develop, manufacture, commercialize, use, or otherwise exploit any compound or product (a) that is a compound or product under the MyoKardia Collaboration Agreement that is directed against the Cardiomyopathy Target Candidates for the treatment, prophylaxis, or diagnosis of any indication or (b) for the treatment of any genetically defined cardiomyopathies shown to be related to certain specified genes of interest that are modulated by the Cardiomyopathy Targets.
 Under the MyoKardia Collaboration Agreement, MyoKardia made a $10.0 million upfront payment and a $2.5 million payment as prepaid research funding to us in July 2020. MyoKardia will also reimburse us for the costs of the research activities not covered by the prepaid research funding, up to a maximum amount of total research funding (including the prepaid research funding). Upon the achievement of specified preclinical, development and sales milestones, we will be entitled to preclinical milestone payments, development milestone payments and sales milestone payments of up to $298.5 
 33


million in the aggregate per target for certain Identified Targets, and of up to $150.0 million in the aggregate per target for certain other Identified Targets. MyoKardia will also pay us tiered royalties ranging from a mid single-digit percentage to a low double-digit percentage based on MyoKardia’s, and any of its affiliates’ and sublicensees’, annual worldwide net sales of products under the MyoKardia Collaboration Agreement directed against any Identified Target. The royalties are payable on a product-by-product basis during a specified royalty term, and may be reduced in specified circumstances. 
 The MyoKardia Collaboration Agreement continues on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the last to expire royalty term for a product, at which time the MyoKardia Collaboration Agreement expires with respect to such product in such country. Either party has the right to terminate the MyoKardia Collaboration Agreement if the other party has materially breached in the performance of its obligations under the MyoKardia Collaboration Agreement and such breach has not been cured within the applicable cure period. MyoKardia also has the right to terminate the MyoKardia Collaboration Agreement for convenience in its entirety or on a target-by-target, product-by-product or molecule-by-molecule basis. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including by seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in our field. 
 Our future commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to: obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce in our intellectual property rights, in particular our patents rights; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing, misappropriating or violating the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. 
 The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies like ours are generally uncertain and can involve complex legal, scientific and factual issues. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. We also cannot ensure that patents will issue with respect to any patent applications that we or our licensors may file in the future, nor can we ensure that any of our owned or licensed patents or future patents will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates and methods of manufacturing the same. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application may be significantly reduced before a patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted and even challenged after issuance. As a result, we cannot guarantee that any of our products will be protected or remain protectable by enforceable patents. Moreover, any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property. 
 We generally file patent applications directed to our key programs in an effort to secure our intellectual property positions vis-a-vis these programs. As of February 25, 2021, we owned or in-licensed eight U.S. patents, three U.S. pending non-provisional patent applications and related pending foreign patent applications, two pending Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications and two U.S. provisional patent applications. 
 The intellectual property portfolio for our most advanced programs as of February 25, 2021, is summarized below. Prosecution is a lengthy process, during which the scope of the claims initially submitted for examination by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office may be significantly narrowed before issuance, if issued at all. We expect this may be the case with respect to some of our pending patent applications referred to below. 
 Losmapimod and Derivatives 
 The patent portfolio for losmapimod is based upon Fulcrum-owned patents, patent applications and in-licensed patents directed to new methods of using losmapimod and other p38 inhibitors to treat FSHD, pharmaceutical compositions generically and specifically covering p38 inhibitors, and methods for identifying novel compositions to treat FSHD. As of February 25, 2021, we owned two U.S. patents, two U.S. pending non-provisional patent applications and related foreign patent applications, and one U.S. pending provisional application that relate to our p38α/ß program, relating to methods of using losmapimod and certain other p38 inhibitors for the treatment of FSHD. These patents and patent applications are expected to expire in 2038.
 34


Losmapimod is also currently protected by patents owned by GSK (as a composition of matter and certain uses which do not include FSHD) and certain of these patents are licensed to us. As of February 25, 2021, we control through our exclusive licensing agreement with GSK six issued U.S. patents and related foreign patents and patent applications, all relating to losmapimod and its pharmaceutical compositions. The U.S. patents and related foreign patents directed to losmapimod composition of matter are expected to expire in 2023.
 FTX-6058
 As of February 25, 2021, the intellectual property portfolio for our FTX-6058 program include two owned PCT applications and two pending U.S. patent applications directed in part to pharmaceutical compositions as well as to methods for using and making these compositions. In order to continue to pursue protection based on PCT applications, we will need to nationalize the international applications into U.S. non-provisional patent applications and ex-U.S. applications prior to the applicable expiration deadline of the PCT applications. If issued, any patents that may issue from the U.S. non-provisional patent applications and/or foreign patent applications would be projected to have statutory expiration dates between 2039 and 2040, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extension, if applicable.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. 
 In the United States, the term of a patent covering an FDA-approved drug may, in certain cases, be eligible for a patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 as compensation for the loss of patent term during the FDA regulatory review process. The period of extension may be up to five years, but cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent among those eligible for an extension and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and in certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. It is possible that issued U.S. patents covering the use of losmapimod and products from our intellectual property may be entitled to patent term extensions. If our use of drug candidates or the drug candidate itself receive FDA approval, we intend to apply for patent term extensions, if available, to extend the term of patents that cover the approved use or drug candidate. We also intend to seek patent term extensions in any jurisdictions where available, however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. 
 In addition to patent protection, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and confidential know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. However, trade secrets and confidential know-how are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with any collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have agreements requiring assignment of inventions with selected consultants, scientific advisors and collaborators. These agreements may not provide meaningful protection. These agreements may also be breached, and we may not have an adequate remedy for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets and/or confidential know-how may become known or be independently developed by a third party, or misused by any collaborator to whom we disclose such information. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain or use information that we regard as proprietary. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information, third parties may independently develop the same or similar proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to our proprietary information. As a result, we may be unable to meaningfully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Intellectual Property” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property. 
 Manufacturing 
 We do not have any manufacturing facilities. We have obtained sufficient losmapimod tablets, or drug product, from GSK to complete our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials in FSHD. We believe that we have received a sufficient quantity of losmapimod API from GSK to complete further clinical trials in FSHD. We have engaged a contract manufacturing organization to prepare our own API and to manufacture losmapimod tablets. We believe that we have all the necessary information from GSK to enable the required technology transfers to contract manufacturing organizations. 
 We have obtained sufficient quantities of FTX-6058 to complete our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial from a contract manufacturing organization.
 We expect to continue to rely on third parties for the manufacture of FTX-6058 for any future clinical trials and for the manufacture of any future product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. Our lead product candidates are small molecules and can be manufactured in 
 35


reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities. 
Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our therapeutic product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics in guiding the use of related therapeutics, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval or emergency use authorizations for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. If our product candidates achieve marketing approval, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products. 
 If our lead product candidates are approved for the indications for which we are currently undertaking clinical trials, they will compete with the therapies and currently marketed drugs discussed below. 
 FSHD 
 There are no approved therapies for the treatment of FSHD. Controlled trials of albuterol, corticosteroids and a myostatin inhibitor all failed to demonstrate a clinical benefit to patients with FSHD. Low-intensity aerobic exercise tailored to the patient’s distribution of weakness may provide some limited beneficial effect. Limited range of motion in the shoulder girdle can stem from periscapular muscle weakness, and in such cases surgical scapular fixation can result in some functional improvement for certain patients. There is also no standard practice regarding the use of physical or occupational therapy across countries and sites. 
 We are not aware of any product candidate currently in clinical development for FSHD with the same mechanism of action as losmapimod or that is designed to treat the root cause of FSHD.
 SCD 
 Approved drug treatments for SCD focus primarily on the management and reduction of pain episodes, vaso-occlusive crises, and inhibition of hemoglobin S polymerization. The four drug treatments approved in the United States are hydroxyurea, voxelotor, crizanlizumab, and L-glutamine. Hydroxyurea, marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, is approved for the treatment of anemia related to SCD, to reduce the frequency of painful crises and the need for blood transfusions. Voxelotor, marketed by Global Blood Therapeutics, is approved under accelerated approval as a hemoglobin polymerization inhibitor. Crizanlizumab, marketed by Novartis, is approved for the reduction in the frequency of vasoocclusive crises. L-glutamine, marketed by Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc., is approved to reduce severe complications associated with the disorder. 
 36


Blood transfusions can be utilized to decrease the sickling of RBCs. While blood transfusions can be critically important to the management of SCD, there are a number of limitations associated with this therapeutic approach, including limited patient access and serious complications such as iron overload. The only potentially curative treatment currently approved for severe SCD is bone marrow transplantation. However, this treatment option is not commonly used given the difficulties of finding a suitable matched donor and the risks associated with the treatment, which include an approximately 5% mortality rate. Bone marrow transplantation is more commonly offered to pediatric patients with available sibling-matched donors. 
 FTX-6058 could face competition from a number of different therapeutic approaches in development for patients with SCD. EpiDestiny, Inc., or EpiDestiny, in collaboration with Novo Nordisk A/S, is evaluating EPI01, a small molecule designed to increase production of fetal hemoglobin, which has completed a Phase 1 clinical trial. Imara, Inc. is evaluating IMR-687, a PDE9 inhibitor, in Phase 2a and Phase 2b clinical trials in patients with sickle cell anemia. Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., is evaluating mitapivat, a PKR activator, in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with SCD. Forma Therapeutics Holdings, Inc., is evaluating FT-4202, a PKR activator, in a Phase 2/3 clinical trial. Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, is evaluating TAK-755, recombinant ADAMTS13 protein, in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in participants with baseline health SCD and SCD with acute vaso-occlusive crisis. Pfizer, is evaluating PF-07059013, a hemoglobin subunit beta modulator, in a Phase 1 clinical trial. CRISPR Therapeutics AG (in collaboration with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, or Vertex), is evaluating CTX001, a gene therapy, in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial. Aruvant Sciences, Inc. is evaluating ARU-1801, a gene therapy, in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial. CSL Behring, is evaluating CSL200 CAL-H, a gene therapy, in a Phase 1 clinical trial. Sangamo Therapeutics Inc., or Sangamo, in collaboration with Bioverativ Inc., or Bioverativ, is developing BIVV-003, a gene editing cell therapy that modifies cells to produce functional RBCs using fetal hemoglobin, in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial. There are also several other gene editing approaches being evaluated by Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (in collaboration with Novartis) and Editas Medicine, Inc. Pfizer conducted a Phase 1b clinical trial with PF-04447943, a PDE9 inhibitor, in patients with SCD. 
 ß-thalassemia 
 The current standard of care for many patients with ß-thalassemia is frequent blood transfusions to manage anemia. The one drug treatment approved in the United States is luspatercept. Luspatercept, marketed by Celgene, is approved as an erythroid maturation agent for the treatment of adult patients with anemia associated with ß-thalassemia and who require regular red blood cell transfusions. The only potentially curative therapy for ß-thalassemia is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, which is associated with serious risk and is limited to patients with a suitable donor. The European Commission granted conditional marketing authorization for ZYNTEGLO, a gene therapy developed by bluebird for the treatment of adult and adolescent patients with transfusion-dependent ß-thalassemia and with certain genotypes, in Europe in June 2019. bluebird has initiated a rolling biologics license application, or BLA, submission for betibeglogene autotemcel in the United States, which is expected to be completed in mid-2021. Acceleron in collaboration with Celgene Corp., or Celgene, received FDA and EMA approval for luspatercept, an erythroid maturation agent for the treatment of adult patients with anemia associated with ß-thalassemia and who require frequent transfusions. 
 FTX-6058 could face competition from a number of different therapeutic approaches in development for patients with transfusion-dependent ß-thalassemia.
 Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial to evaluate a modified donor T cell therapy to be used in conjunction with hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Kiadis Pharma is conducting Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials of an adjunctive T cell immunotherapy treatment in conjunction with hematopoietic stem cell transplant.. Imara, Inc. is evaluating IMR-687, a PDE9 inhibitor, in a Phase 2b clinical trial in patients with ß-thalassemia.

Government Regulation and Product Approvals 
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, pricing, reimbursement, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of biopharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 Approval and Regulation of Drugs in the United States 
 In the United States, drug products are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and applicable implementing regulations and guidance. The failure of an applicant to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, including non-clinical testing, clinical testing, the approval process or post-approval process, may result in delays to the conduct of a study, regulatory review and approval and/or administrative or judicial sanctions.
 An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug in the United States generally must satisfactorily complete each of the following steps before the product candidate will be approved by the FDA: 
  
• | preclinical testing including laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies, which must be performed in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations and standards;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, potency and purity of the product candidate for each proposed indication, in accordance with current good clinical practices, or GCP;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, for a drug product which includes not only the results of the clinical trials, but also, detailed information on the chemistry, manufacture and quality controls for the product candidate and proposed labelling for one or more proposed indication(s);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review of the product candidate by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities, including those of third parties, at which the product candidate or components thereof are manufactured to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of any FDA audits of the non-clinical and clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of clinical data in support of the NDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA to allow marketing of the new drug product; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct any post-approval studies required by the FDA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies 
 Before an applicant begins testing a product candidate with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage, including in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as other studies to evaluate, among other things, the toxicity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations and standards. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among 
 38


other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity and long-term toxicity studies may continue after the IND is submitted. 
 The IND and IRB Processes 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their voluntary informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
 An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any product candidate that is not the subject of an approved NDA. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial, and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In these cases, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. 
 Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. Clinical holds are imposed by the FDA whenever there is concern for patient safety and may be a result of new data, findings, or developments in clinical, nonclinical, and/or chemistry, manufacturing, and controls. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol may not be allowed to proceed, while other protocols may be allowed. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, a clinical trial may only resume after the FDA has so notified the sponsor. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the clinical trial can proceed. 
 A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When a foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain regulatory requirements, including CGP requirements, of the FDA in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. The GCP requirements encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies. 
 In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization as to whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or the competitive environment. 
 39


Information about clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website. Similar requirements for posting clinical trial information are present in the European Union (EudraCT) website: https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/ and other countries, as well.
 Expanded Access to an Investigational Drug for Treatment Use 
 Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational new drug products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational drugs for patients who may benefit from investigational therapies. FDA regulations allow access to investigational drugs under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the drug under a treatment protocol or Treatment IND Application. 
 When considering an IND application for expanded access to an investigational product with the purpose of treating a patient or a group of patients, the sponsor and treating physicians or investigators will determine suitability when all of the following criteria apply: patient(s) have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context or condition to be treated; and the expanded use of the investigational drug for the requested treatment will not interfere with the initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the product or otherwise compromise the potential development of the product. 
 There is no obligation for a sponsor to make its drug products available for expanded access. If a sponsor has a policy regarding how it responds to expanded access requests, it must make such policy publicly available upon the earlier of initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial; or 15 days after the drug or biologic receives designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy. 
 In addition to and separate from expanded access, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy. 
 Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of a qualified investigator in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written clinical trial protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Additional studies may also be required after approval. 
 Phase 1 clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, including adverse effects, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and pharmacodynamics in healthy humans or in patients. During Phase 1 clinical trials, information about the investigational drug product’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials. 
 Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications and determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more costly Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 2 clinical trials are well controlled, closely monitored and conducted in a limited patient population. 
 Phase 3 clinical trials proceed if the Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken within an expanded patient 
 40


population to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. A well-controlled, statistically robust Phase 3 clinical trial may be designed to deliver the data that regulatory authorities will use to decide whether or not to approve, and, if approved, how to appropriately label a drug. Such Phase 3 studies are referred to as “pivotal.” 
 In some cases, the FDA may approve an NDA for a product candidate but require the sponsor to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product candidate’s safety and effectiveness after approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of a larger number of patients in the intended treatment group and to further document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under accelerated approval regulations. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products. 
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies. They must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 Pediatric Studies 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time. 
 For drugs intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, the FDA must, upon the request of an applicant, meet to discuss preparation of the initial pediatric study plan or to discuss deferral or waiver of pediatric assessments. In addition, the FDA will meet early in the development process to discuss pediatric study plans with sponsors, and the FDA must meet with sponsors by no later than the end-of-phase 1 meeting for serious or life-threatening diseases and by no later than ninety (90) days after the FDA’s receipt of the study plan. 
 The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act in 2012. The FDA maintains a list of diseases that are exempt from the requirements of PREA, due to low prevalence of disease in the pediatric population. Under the amended section 505B of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, or FDARA, beginning on August 18, 2020, the submission of a pediatric assessment, waiver or deferral will be required for certain molecularly targeted cancer indications with the submission of an NDA application or supplement to an NDA application. Previously, drugs that had been granted orphan drug designation were exempt from the requirements of the PREA.
 Review and Approval of an NDA 
 In order to obtain approval to market a drug product in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides sufficient data establishing the safety, purity and potency of the proposed drug product for its intended indication. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, 
 41


manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by independent investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety, purity and potency of the drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. 
 The NDA is a vehicle through which applicants formally propose that the FDA approve a new product for marketing and sale in the United States for one or more indications. Every new non-biologic drug product candidate must be the subject of an approved NDA before it may be commercialized in the United States. BLAs are submitted for approval of biologic products. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2021 is $2,875,842 for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee, which for fiscal year 2021 is $336,432. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for products with orphan designation, an exception from the program fee when the program does not engage in manufacturing the drug during a particular fiscal year and a waiver for certain small businesses. 
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of the application, generally within 60 calendar days of its receipt, and strives to inform the sponsor within 74 days whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept the application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Under that agreement, 90% of applications seeking approval of New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date on which the FDA accepts the application for filing, and 90% of applications for NMEs that have been designated for Priority Review are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date. The review process and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, goal date may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. 
 Before approving an application, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is being or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including component manufacturing, finished product manufacturing and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Under the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, the FDA must implement a protocol to expedite review of responses to inspection reports pertaining to certain applications, including applications for products in shortage or those for which approval is dependent on remediation of conditions identified in the inspection report. 
 In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. A REMS uses risk-minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, the seriousness of the disease, the expected benefit of the product, the expected duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events and whether the product is a new molecular entity. 
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel product to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that review, evaluate and provide a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but the FDA considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Priority Review and Regenerative Advanced Therapy Designations 
 The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are referred to as Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review designation and Regenerative Advanced Therapy designation. 
 Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interaction with the FDA, and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information, and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. 
 42


However, the FDA’s time-period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
 Second, a product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner. 
 Third, the FDA may designate a product for Priority Review if it treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A Priority Review designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months. 
 With passage of the Cures Act in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as Regenerative Advanced Therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a Regenerative Advanced Therapy designation include early interactions with the FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for Priority Review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints. 
 Accelerated Approval Pathway 
 The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely, based on epidemiologic, therapeutic, pathophysiologic, or other evidence, to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval. 
 For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, efficacy biomarker or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a product. 
 The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. The benefit of accelerated approval derives from the potential to receive approval based on surrogate endpoints sooner than possible for trials with clinical or survival endpoints, rather than deriving from any explicit shortening of the FDA approval timeline, as is the case with Priority Review. 
 The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to initiate expedited 
 43


proceedings to withdraw approval of the product. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. 
 The FDA’s Decision on an NDA 
 On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the application and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 If the FDA approves a new product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, or require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval. The agency may also require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including a REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. REMS programs can include medication guides, communication plans for health care professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patent registries. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. The FDA may require a REMS before or after approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, changing manufacturing processes and adding labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 Post-Approval Regulation 
 If regulatory approval for marketing of a product or new indication for an existing product is obtained, the sponsor will be required to comply with all regular post-approval regulatory requirements as well as any post-approval requirements that the FDA may have imposed as part of the approval process. The sponsor will be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and manufacturing problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling requirements. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP regulations, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Accordingly, the sponsor and its third-party manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP regulations and other regulatory requirements. 
 A product may also be subject to official lot release, meaning that the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA samples of each lot, together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. Finally, the FDA will conduct laboratory research related to the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of pharmaceutical products. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 44


 
• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drug products placed on the market. This regulation includes, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. Promotional claims about a drug’s safety or effectiveness are prohibited before the drug is approved. After approval, a drug product generally may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA, as reflected in the product’s prescribing information. In the United States, health care professionals are generally permitted to prescribe drugs for such uses not described in the drug’s labeling, known as off-label uses, because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose rigorous restrictions on manufacturers’ communications, prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. It may be permissible, under very specific, narrow conditions, for a manufacturer to engage in nonpromotional, non-misleading communication regarding off-label information, such as distributing scientific or medical journal information. 
 If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the DOJ, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion, and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. 
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and its implementing regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCA, which regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drug samples at the federal level, and set minimum standards for the regulation of distributors by the states. The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market. 
 Section 505(b)(2) NDAs 
 NDAs for most new drug products are based on two full clinical studies which must contain substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the proposed new product for the proposed use. These applications are submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. The FDA is, however, authorized to approve an alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. This type of application allows the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and efficacy for a similar product, or published literature. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) applies to NDAs for a drug for which the investigations made to show whether or not the drug is safe for use and effective in use and relied upon by the applicant for approval of the application “were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.” 
 Thus, Section 505(b)(2) authorizes the FDA to approve an NDA based on safety and effectiveness data that were not developed by the applicant. NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(2) may provide an alternate and potentially more expeditious pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, the applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
 Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs 
 In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress established an abbreviated regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve generic drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs, known as the reference listed drugs, or RLDs.  Abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, the applicant may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for the RLD. 
 To approve an ANDA, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, route of administration, dosage form, strength and conditions of use of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is bioequivalent to the RLD. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD 
 45


if “the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.” Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. 
 Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. 
 Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay 
 Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. 
 Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that: 
  
• | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


• | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the applicant is not seeking approval). 
 If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, the expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
 To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. As a result, approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
 Pediatric Exclusivity 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits 
 46


pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. With regard to patents, the six-month pediatric exclusivity period will not attach to any patents for which a generic (ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA) applicant submitted a paragraph IV patent certification, unless the NDA sponsor or patent owner first obtains a court determination that the patent is valid and infringed by a proposed generic product.
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. A company must seek orphan drug designation before submitting an NDA for the candidate product. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the PDUFA goal dates for the regulatory review and approval process, although it does convey certain advantages such as tax benefits and exemption from the PDUFA application fee. 
 If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same drug for the same condition for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different product for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same product for different conditions. If a drug designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. 
 Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same drug for the same condition is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. This is the case despite an earlier court opinion holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously required the FDA to recognize orphan exclusivity regardless of a showing of clinical superiority. Under Omnibus legislation signed by President Trump on December 27, 2020, the requirement for a subsequent product to show clinical superiority in order to break the previous product’s orphan drug exclusivity applies to drugs and biologics that received orphan drug designation before enactment of FDARA in 2017, but have not yet been approved or licensed by FDA.
 Patent Term Restoration and Extension 
 A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted on a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date of a clinical investigation involving human beings is begun and the submission date of an application, plus the time between the submission date of an application and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and only those claims covering the approved product, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Additionally, the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The United States Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA. 
Health Care Law and Regulation 
 Health care providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, patient privacy laws and regulations and other health care laws and regulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state health care laws and regulations, include the following: 

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 47


 
to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or the ACA, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to health care items or services that are reimbursed by non-government third-party payors, including private insurers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Further, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. Additionally, some state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives in the jurisdiction. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage and Health Care Reform 
 In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated health care costs. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. 
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. 
 The containment of health care costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and biologics and other medical products, government control and other changes to the health care system in the United States. 
 In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the ACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for drug products under government health care programs. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our potential product candidates are: 
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of “average manufacturer price” for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 70% point-of-sale-discount off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 49


Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2030 pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.
 Since enactment of the ACA, there have been and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed by President Trump on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, is effective as of 2019. Additionally, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. Congress may consider other legislation to replace elements of the ACA during the next Congressional session. 
 The Trump Administration also took executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the ACA, including directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On January 28, 2021, however, President Biden rescinded those orders and issued a new Executive Order which directs federal agencies to reconsider rules and other policies that limit Americans’ access to health care, and consider actions that will protect and strengthen that access.  Under this Executive Order, federal agencies are directed to re-examine: policies that undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions, including complications related to COVID-19; demonstrations and waivers under Medicaid and the ACA that may reduce coverage or undermine the programs, including work requirements; policies that undermine the Health Insurance Marketplace or other markets for health insurance; policies that make it more difficult to enroll in Medicaid and the ACA; and policies that reduce affordability of coverage or financial assistance, including for dependents.
 On November 10, 2020, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments as to whether the individual mandate portion of the ACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well.  On February 10, 2021, the Biden Administration withdrew DOJ’s support for this lawsuit. A ruling by the Supreme Court is expected sometime this year.  Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.
 The costs of prescription pharmaceuticals have also been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States. To date, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries, as well as proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. To those ends, President Trump issued five Executive Orders intended to lower the costs of prescription drug products but it is unclear whether, and to what extent, these orders will remain in force under the Biden Administration.   
 Further, on September 24, 2020, the Trump Administration finalized a rulemaking allowing states or certain other non-federal government entities to submit importation program proposals to FDA for review and approval. Applicants are required to demonstrate that their importation plans pose no additional risk to public health and safety and will result in significant cost savings for consumers.  The FDA has issued draft guidance that would allow manufacturers to import their own FDA-approved drugs that are authorized for sale in other countries (multi-market approved products).
 At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and 
 50


federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures. 
 Review and Approval of Medicinal Products in the European Union 
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. Specifically, however, the process governing approval of medicinal products in the European Union, or EU, generally follows the same lines as in the United States. It entails satisfactory completion of preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication. It also requires the submission to the relevant competent authorities of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, and granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the EU. 
 Clinical Trial Approval 
 The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP and the related national implementing provisions of the individual member states of the European Union, or EU Member States, govern the system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU. Under this system, an applicant must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by, among other documents, an investigational medicinal product dossier (the Common Technical Document) with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2005/28/EC, where relevant the implementing national provisions of the individual EU Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance documents.
 In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014, was adopted, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive. The Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable in all EU Member States without the need for any national implementing legislation. It will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the EU. The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EU. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval of clinical trials, the sponsor of a clinical trial will be required to submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial to a reporting EU Member State through an EU Portal. The submission procedure will be the same irrespective of whether the clinical trial is to be conducted in a single EU Member State or in more than one EU Member State.   
 
The Clinical Trials Regulation has not yet become effective. In January 2020, the website of the European Commission reported that the implementation of the Clinical Trials Regulation was dependent on the development of a fully functional clinical trials portal and database, which would be confirmed by an independent audit which was conducted in December 2020, and that the new legislation would come into effect six months after the European Commission publishes a notice of this confirmation. The Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable six months after the European Commission publishes notice of this confirmation and has published an expected system “go live” in December 2021. When the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable, the existing Clinical Trial Directive and national legislation put in place to implement the Directive will be repealed. Following implementation of the Clinical Trials Regulation, a transitional period will be in effect for one year where new clinical trial applications can be submitted either under the existing Clinical Trials Directive or under the new Clinical Trials Regulation.

PRIME Designation in the EU 
 In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The Priority Medicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises, or SMEs, may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated MAA assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated Agency contact and rapporteur from the Committee for Human Medicinal Products, or CHMP, or Committee for Advanced Therapies, are appointed early in PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s Committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies. 
 Marketing Authorization 
 To obtain a marketing authorization for a product under EU regulatory systems, an applicant must submit an MAA either under a centralized procedure administered by the EMA, or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in the EU Member States (decentralized procedure, national procedure or mutual recognition procedure). A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the EU. Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 provides that prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the EU, applicants have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Paediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted (1) a product-specific waiver, (2) a class waiver or (3) a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. 
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid across the European Economic Area (i.e., the EU as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional. The centralized procedure may at the request of the applicant also be used in certain other cases. We anticipate that the centralized procedure will be mandatory for the product candidates we are developing. 
 Under the centralized procedure, the CHMP is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product and for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days but it is possible that the CHMP can revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it considers that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. At the end of this period, the CHMP provides a scientific opinion on whether or not a marketing authorization should be granted in relation to a medicinal product. Within 15 calendar days of receipt of a final opinion from the CHMP, the European Commission must prepare a draft decision concerning an application for marketing authorization. This draft decision must take the opinion and any relevant provisions of EU law into account. Before arriving at a final decision on an application for centralized authorization of a medicinal product the European Commission must consult the Standing Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use. The Standing Committee is composed of representatives of the EU Member States and chaired by a non-voting European Commission representative. The European Parliament also has a related “droit de regard”. The European Parliament’s role is to ensure that the European Commission has not exceeded its powers in deciding to grant or refuse to grant a marketing authorization.

The European Commission may grant a so-called “marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances”. Such authorization is intended for products for which the applicant can demonstrate that it is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use, because the indications for which the product in question is intended are encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence, or in the present state of scientific knowledge, comprehensive information cannot be provided, or it would be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical ethics to collect such information. Consequently, marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances may be granted subject to certain specific obligations, which may include the following: 
  
• | the applicant must complete an identified program of studies within a time period specified by the competent authority, the results of which form the basis of a reassessment of the benefit/risk profile;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the medicinal product in question may be supplied on medical prescription only and may in certain cases be administered only under strict medical supervision, possibly in a hospital and in the case of a radiopharmaceutical, by an authorized person; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the package leaflet and any medical information must draw the attention of the medical practitioner to the fact that the particulars available concerning the medicinal product in question are as yet inadequate in certain specified respects.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances is subject to annual review to reassess the risk-benefit balance in an annual reassessment procedure. Continuation of the authorization is linked to the annual reassessment and a negative assessment could potentially result in the marketing authorization being suspended or revoked. The renewal of a marketing authorization of a medicinal product under exceptional circumstances, however, follows the same rules as a “normal” marketing authorization. Thus, a marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances is granted for an initial five years, after which the authorization will become valid indefinitely, unless the EMA decides that safety grounds merit one additional five-year renewal. 
 The European Commission may also grant a so-called “conditional marketing authorization” prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for an application for a full marketing authorization. Such conditional marketing authorizations may be granted for product candidates (including medicines designated as orphan medicinal products), if (i) the risk-benefit balance of the product candidate is positive, (ii) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (iii) the product fulfills an unmet medical need and (iv) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. A conditional marketing authorization may contain specific obligations to be fulfilled by the marketing authorization holder, including obligations with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions and/or specific obligations. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to the review by the CHMP of applications for a conditional marketing authorization. 
 The EU medicines rules expressly permit the EU Member States to adopt national legislation prohibiting or restricting the sale, supply or use of any medicinal product containing, consisting of or derived from a specific type of human or animal cell, such as embryonic stem cells. While the products we have in development do not make use of embryonic stem cells, it is possible that the national laws in certain EU Member States may prohibit or restrict us from commercializing our products, even if they have been granted an EU marketing authorization. 
 Unlike the centralized authorization procedure, the decentralized marketing authorization procedure requires a separate application to, and leads to separate approval by, the competent authorities of each EU Member State in which the product is to be marketed. This application is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States who, within 90 days of receipt, must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all EU Member States. 
 The mutual recognition procedure similarly is based on the acceptance by the competent authorities of the EU Member States of the marketing authorization of a medicinal product by the competent authorities of other EU Member States. The holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the competent authority of an EU Member State requesting that this authority recognize the marketing authorization delivered by the competent authority of another EU Member State.

Regulatory Data Protection in the EU 
 In the EU, innovative medicinal products approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity pursuant to Directive 2001/83/EC. Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 repeats this entitlement for medicinal products authorized in accordance the centralized authorization procedure. Data exclusivity prevents applicants for authorization of generics of these innovative products from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abridged) application for a period of eight years. During an additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic MAA can be submitted and authorized, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be placed on the EU market until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be an NCE so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials. 
 Periods of Authorization and Renewals 
 A marketing authorization has an initial validity for five years in principle. The marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the EU Member State. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. The European Commission or the competent authorities of the EU Member States may decide, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one further five-year period of marketing authorization. Once subsequently definitively renewed, the marketing authorization shall be valid for an unlimited period. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the medicinal product on the EU market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing EU Member State within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause). 
 Paediatric Studies and Exclusivity 
 Prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, applicants must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved PIP covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. The respective requirements for all marketing authorization procedures are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the so-called Paediatric Regulation. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The Paediatric Committee of the EMA, or PDCO, may grant deferrals for some medicines, allowing a company to delay development of the medicine for children until there is enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults. The PDCO may also grant waivers when development of a medicine for children is not needed or is not appropriate, such as for diseases that only affect the elderly population. Before an MAA can be filed, or an existing marketing authorization can be amended, the EMA determines that companies actually comply with the agreed studies and measures listed in each relevant PIP. If an applicant obtains a marketing authorization in all EU Member States, or a marketing authorization granted in the centralized procedure by the European Commission, and the study results for the pediatric population are included in the product information, even when negative, the medicine is then eligible for an additional six-month period of qualifying patent protection through extension of the term of the Supplementary Protection Certificate. 
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000, as implemented by Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provides that a drug can be designated as an orphan drug by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the EU when the application is made, or (2) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. 
 54


Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity in all EU Member States and in addition a range of other benefits during the development and regulatory review process including scientific assistance for study protocols, authorization through the centralized marketing authorization procedure covering all member countries and a reduction or elimination of registration and marketing authorization fees. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 
 Regulatory Requirements After a Marketing Authorization has been Obtained 
 In case an authorization for a medicinal product in the EU is obtained, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. These include: 

• | Compliance with the EU’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules must be ensured. These rules can impose post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The manufacturing of authorized medicinal products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the EU with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the EU.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The marketing and promotion of authorized drugs, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the EU notably under Directive 2001/83EC, as amended, and are also subject to EU Member State laws. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is prohibited across the EU.

General Data Protection Regulation 
 The collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the EU, including personal health data, is subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EU, including the U.S., and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance.
 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom 
 On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit. Following protracted negotiations, the United Kingdom left the EU on January 31, 2020. On December 24, 2020, the United Kingdom and the European Union entered into a Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which sets out certain procedures for approval and recognition of medical products in each jurisdiction. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime that applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom, as the United Kingdom legislation now has the potential to diverge from European legislation. It remains to be seen how Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the United Kingdom in the long-term. The MHRA has recently published detailed guidance for industry and 
 55


organizations to follow from January 1, 2021 now that the transition period is over, which will be updated as the United Kingdom’s regulatory position on medical products evolves over time.  
 Furthermore, while the Data Protection Act of 2018 in the United Kingdom that “implements” and complements the EU’s GDPR, is now effective in the United Kingdom, it is still unclear whether transfer of data from the European Economic Area, or EEA, to the United Kingdom will remain lawful under GDPR. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement provides for a transitional period during which the United Kingdom will be treated like an EU Member State in relation to processing and transfers of personal data for four months from January 1, 2021.  This may be extended by two further months. After such period, the United Kingdom will be a “third country” under the GDPR unless the European Commission adopts an adequacy decision in respect of transfers of personal data to the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has already determined that it considers all of the EU and EEA member states to be adequate for the purposes of data protection, ensuring that data flows from the United Kingdom to the EU and EEA remain unaffected.
 Pricing Decisions for Approved Products 
 In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, EU Member States have the option to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. EU Member States may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other EU Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the EU have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage health care expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the EU. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. 
 As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU Member States, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced EU Member States, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries.
