Our Company 
 Tilray, Inc. (“Tilray”, “we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company”) is a global pioneer in cannabis research, cultivation, production and distribution, incorporated in the State of Delaware on January 24, 2018. On April 30, 2021, Tilray and Aphria completed the Arrangement. The business combination brought together two highly complementary businesses to create a leading cannabis-focused consumer packaged goods company with one of the largest global geographic footprints in the industry.  With a focus on sustainability, our state-of-the-art greenhouses and cultivation operations, processing and distribution facilities make us one of the world’s leading fully-integrated cannabis companies.
 We were among the first companies to be permitted to cultivate and sell legal medical cannabis. Today, we supply high-quality medical cannabis products to tens of thousands of patients in 20 countries spanning five continents through our global subsidiaries, and through agreements with established pharmaceutical distributors. 
 We are a leader in the recreational adult-use market in Canada where we offer a broad-based portfolio of adult-use brands and products, and continue to expand our portfolio to include new innovative cannabis products and formats. We maintain agreements to supply all Canadian provinces and the Yukon and Northwest Territories with our adult-use products for sale through their established retail distribution systems. We believe that our differentiated

portfolio of brands, which is designed to resonate with consumers in all categories, sets us apart from our competitors and is providing us with the ability to establish a leading position in the adult-use market in Canada. Therefore, we are investing in brand building with our consumers, new product innovation, insights, distribution, trade marketing and cannabis education to drive market share in the Canadian adult-use cannabis industry.
 Through Fresh Hemp Foods Ltd. (“Manitoba Harvest”), we are also a leading hemp food manufacturer.  Manitoba Harvest produces, manufactures, markets and distributes a broad-based portfolio of hemp-based food products, which are sold in major retailers across the U.S. and Canada.
 In November 2020, Aphria acquired SW Brewing Company, LLC (“SweetWater”), the 11th largest craft brewery in the United States according to Brewers Association.  Founded in 1997, SweetWater has broad consumer appeal and has established strong distribution across the United States.  From its state-of-the-art brewery in Atlanta, Georgia, SweetWater produces a balanced variety of year-round and seasonal specialty craft brews.  
 Following completion of the Arrangement, we reconstituted our senior management team with members from both Aphria and Tilray.  The experienced new leadership team provides a strong foundation to accelerate our growth and capitalize on the business combination’s many benefits. Our management team is complemented by experienced operators, cannabis industry experts, PhD scientists, horticulturists, and extraction specialists, all of whom apply the latest scientific knowledge and technology to deliver quality-controlled, rigorously tested cannabis products on a large scale. 
 Our Opportunity
 With the closing of the Arrangement, we are now focused on executing our highest return priorities including business integration and accelerating our global growth strategy. Tilray is poised to transform the industry with our highly scalable operational footprint, a curated portfolio of diverse medical and adult-use cannabis brands and products, a multi-continent distribution network, and a robust capital structure to fund our global expansion strategy.
 The business combination provides, among others, the following financial and strategic benefits:
  
• | Strategic Footprint and Operational Scale. We believe that we possess the strategic footprint and operational scale necessary to compete more effectively in today’s consolidating cannabis market with a strong, flexible balance sheet, strong cash balance, and access to capital, which we believe gives us the ability to accelerate growth and deliver long-term sustainable value for stockholders.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Low-cost, State-of-the-Art Production & Leading Canadian Adult-Use Cannabis Producer. The demand for our products will be supported by low-cost state-of-the-art cultivation, processing, and manufacturing facilities, and a complete portfolio of branded cannabis 2.0 products to strengthen our leadership position in Canada.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Positioned to Pursue an Accelerated International Growth Strategy. We are well-positioned to pursue international growth opportunities with our strong medical cannabis brands, distribution network in Germany, and end-to-end European Union Good Manufacturing Practices (“EU-GMP”) supply chain, which includes EU-GMP production facilities in Canada, Portugal and Germany.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhanced Consumer Packaged Goods Presence and Infrastructure in the U.S. In the United States, we maintain a strong consumer packaged goods presence and infrastructure with two strategic businesses: SweetWater, a leading cannabis lifestyle branded craft brewer; and Manitoba Harvest, a pioneer in branded hemp food and ingredient products. In the event of federal legalization in the U.S., we expect to be well-positioned to compete in the U.S. cannabis market given our existing strong brands and distribution system in addition to our track record of growth in consumer-packaged goods and cannabis products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Substantial Synergies. The Company expects to deliver significant cost synergies within eighteen months of closing the Arrangement, including cost synergies in the key areas of cultivation and production, cannabis and product purchasing, sales, and marketing, and corporate expenses.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strategy and Outlook 
 As a leading global cannabis company, we are setting the standard for brand development, product innovation and industrial scale cultivation and automation for the production of cannabis grown in environmentally responsible 
 
6


conditions. Our overall strategy is to leverage our scale, expertise and capabilities to drive market share, achieve industry-leading, profitable growth and build sustainable, long-term shareholder value. In order to ensure long-term sustainable growth, we continue to focus on leveraging consumer insights, drive category management leadership and assess growth opportunities, including the introduction of our product into new geographies, new innovation and strategic partnerships. In addition, we are relentlessly focused on managing our cost of goods and expenses in order to maintain our strong financial position.  
 To achieve our vision of building the leading global cannabis-lifestyle consumer packaged goods company that is changing people’s lives for the better – one person at a time – by inspiring and empowering the worldwide community to live their very best life, we will focus on the following strategies:
  
• | Build global brands that lead, legitimize and define the future of cannabis. As the markets where cannabis is legal today continue to grow and develop and as cannabis legalizes in more countries around the world, we see unique opportunities to introduce, market and distribute our broad portfolio of differentiated brands, that will appeal to a diverse base of patients and consumers. We believe we are well positioned to develop leading global brands and drive sustainable growth.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Develop innovative products and form factors that change the way the world consumes cannabis. We plan to continue to develop innovative products and form factors that possess the most consumer demand and are truly differentiated from our competitors, while optimizing our production capabilities. We will continue to invest in innovation in order to continue to provide our patients and consumers with a differentiated portfolio of products that exceeds their expectations and meets their needs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Grow and leverage our investment in craft beer and hemp-based food. We continue to grow the SweetWater brand by expanding our distribution footprint into new territories and focusing on new product development and innovation that delights our consumers. We seek to drive growth in our Manitoba Harvest brand and other hemp-based food and ingredients products by leveraging our consumer insights and consumer marketing activities, new product development as well as educating the consumer on the benefits from hemp-based foods. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand the availability of pure, precise, and predictable medical cannabis products for patients around the world. Since 2014, we have seen an increase in the demand for medical cannabis from both patients, doctors and governments in conjunction with a shift in the medical community, which is increasingly recognizing medical cannabis as a viable option for the treatment of patients suffering from a variety of health conditions. We are focused on driving accessibility to high-quality medical cannabis that is accessible to all and we are well-positioned to do so on a global basis through our EU-GMP certified facilities in Canada, Portugal and Germany. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage our operational scale providing low-cost, high quality production. We believe we have the operational scale necessary to compete more effectively in today’s consolidating cannabis market. Our state-of-the-art facilities are among the lowest cost production operations with the capabilities to produce a complete portfolio of form factors and products, including flower, pre-roll, capsules, vapes, edibles and beverages. We also have a strong, flexible balance sheet, cash balance and access to capital, which we believe will give us the ability to accelerate growth and deliver long-term sustainable value for our stockholders.

Reportable Segments
 Our business is primarily organized around our product categories, each of which have very different target consumers, go-to-market strategies, distribution networks and margins.  This enables us to track and measure our success and build processes for repeatable success in each of these categories. As a result, we have defined our operating segments on a product category basis, as this aligns with how our Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) manages our business, including resource allocation and performance assessment.  We report our operating results in five segments: 

• | Cannabis business – Cultivation, production, distribution and sale of both medical and adult-use cannabis products
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Distribution business – Purchase and resale of pharmaceutical and wellness products to customers
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Beverage alcohol business – Production, distribution and sale of beverage alcohol products

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Business under development – Operations in which we have not received final licensing or have not commenced commercial sales from operations

These investments are focused on brand building with consumers, product innovation, distribution, trade marketing and cannabis education. Our strategy is to develop a brand focused portfolio that resonates with consumers in all category segments. 
 We are positioned to grow our adult-use brand portfolio to specifically meet the different consumer segments of the adult-use cannabis market. We leverage our selection of strains to offer each consumer segment a different experience through its product and terpene profiles, while also focusing on the value proposition for each of these segments as it relates to price, potency and product assortment. We also have a license agreement in place that allows us to produce and distribute certain branded adult-use products in Canada, including Marley Natural™ and Grail™. 
 Each brand is unique to a specific consumer segment and designed to meet the needs of these targeted segments, as described below. Our portfolio of brands and products and our marketing activities have been carefully curated and structured to enable us to develop and promote our brands and product lines in an effective and compliant manner.

Our Wellness Brands
 Manitoba Harvest develops, manufactures, markets and distributes a diverse portfolio of hemp-based food and wellness products under various brands, which include Manitoba Harvest, Hemp Hearts, Hemp Yeah!, Hemp Bliss, Just Hemp Foods, and Mighty Seed Hemp Co.
Our Beverage Alcohol Brands
 SweetWater has created an award-winning lineup of year-round, seasonal and specialty beers under a portfolio of brands closely aligned with a cannabis lifestyle, which include the flagship 420 alcoholic beverage offerings and its Oasis® hard seltzers. We believe the SweetWater product offerings, including the 420 Strain series of products, resonate as a cannabis lifestyle brand.

Our Operations
 Through the investment in building and scaling state-of-the-art facilities, we believe that we maintain one of the highest-quality, lowest cost cannabis production operations in Canada, with the scale and distribution network that differentiates us from our competitors in the industry. We continue to invest in the expansion of our global supply chain to address the unmet needs of patients around the world.
 We currently maintain key international operations in Portugal, Germany, Italy, United Kingdom, Colombia and Argentina as well as strategic relationships in Israel, Denmark and Poland. In establishing our international footprint, we sought to create operational hubs in those continents where we identified the biggest opportunities for growth and designed our operations to ensure consistent, high-quality supply of cannabis products as well as a distribution network.  While these markets are still at various stages of development, and the regulatory environment 
 
10


around them is either newly formed or still being formed, we are uniquely positioned to bring the knowledge and expertise gained in Canada in order to generate profitable growth in these geographies.
Distribution 
 Canadian Adult-use Market
 Under the Canadian legislative regime, provincial, territorial and municipal governments have the authority to prescribe regulations regarding retail and distribution of adult-use cannabis. As such, the distribution model for adult-use cannabis is prescribed by provincial regulations and differs from province to province. Some provinces utilize government run retailers, while others utilize government-licensed private retailers, and some a combination of the two. All of our adult-use sales are conducted according to the applicable provincial and territorial legislation and through applicable local agencies. 
 Through our subsidiaries, Aphria and High Park Holdings Ltd. (“High Park”), we maintain supply agreements for adult-use cannabis with all the provinces and the Yukon Territory and the Northwest Territories in Canada, representing access to 99.8% of Canadians. 
 Aphria is party to a distribution agreement with Great North Distributors to provide sales force and wholesale/retail channel expertise required to efficiently distribute Aphria’s products through each of the provincial/territorial cannabis control agencies.  High Park engaged Kindred Partners Inc. as its sales agent for its adult-use portfolio across all of Canada's provinces and territories, excluding Quebec, in order to leverage Kindred’s industry insights, resources, best-in-class sales team and brand-building services to grow High Park's footprint across the country.  We also engage Rose LifeSciences Ltd. as our sale agent exclusively for the Province of Quebec, representing our entire brand portfolio.
 Canadian Medical Market
 In Canada, the medical distribution channel follows a direct to patient model and both Tilray and Aphria have online portals for patients to effectively and efficiently manage the process of registering and ordering medical products. 
 International Medical Markets
We continue to evaluate the most efficient methods and strategic opportunities to distribute and sell our medical cannabis products to patients and pharmacies around the world. Through our various subsidiaries and partnerships with distributors, our medical products are available to patients in 20 countries on 5 continents, which include the following international distribution channels:

• | CC Pharma is a leading importer and distributor of EU-pharmaceuticals for the German market and throughout Europe and we plan to leverage its distribution network in Germany and throughout Europe.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our products are also distributed by multiple wholesalers and directly to pharmacies in Germany. As a result, we are able to fulfill prescriptions for our medical cannabis products throughout Germany.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We import and distribute compliant medical cannabis products to other international markets, including Italy, Israel, France, Sweden, United Kingdom, and Luxemburg.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In Argentina, ABP, S.A., distributes medical cannabis throughout Argentina under the Argentinian “Compassionate Use” national law, which allows patients with refractory epilepsy, holding a medical prescription from a neurologist, to apply for special access to imported medical cannabis products.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In November 2020, Aphria entered into a strategic relationship with ODI Pharma AB, which gives ODI the exclusive right to sell a defined set of co-branded products in Poland over a five-year period. We will supply medical cannabis product to ODI, which will be processed into finished product, co-branded under the Aphria and ODI brand names, and sold exclusively within the Polish market.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wholesale
 In Canada, we are authorized to sell wholesale bulk and finished cannabis products to other licensees under the Cannabis Regulations. The bulk wholesale sales and distribution channel requires minimal selling, administrative, 
 
11


and fulfillment costs. Our focus on the right strain assortment, quality of flower, extraction capabilities and processing, enables us to drive wholesale channel opportunities for revenue growth. 
 Recent changes in the Canadian market resulted in more competitors moving towards an asset light model through the rationalization of cultivation facilities. As this transition occurs, the Company anticipates demand for its saleable flower to increase, providing new opportunities in the wholesale channel.   
 We also intend to expand our capabilities outside of saleable flower, as our quality of extraction processes continue to grow into new categories with the consumption of new cannabis 2.0 products. We plan to be selective in choosing partners, with the intent to secure supply agreements to further optimize and drive efficiency within our supply chain and operations.  While we intend to pursue wholesale sales channels as part of our growth strategies in Canada, these sales will continue to be used to aid in balancing inventory levels. 
 Wellness Sales and Distribution
 Our wellness sales consist of hemp seed and other hemp-based food products, which are sold to retailers, wholesalers, and direct to consumers. We are a leading provider of hemp seeds and related food products that are sold in over 17,000 retail locations in the United States and Canada and available globally in 19 countries. 
Beverage Alcohol Sales and Distribution
 In the U.S., our craft beer is distributed under a three-tier model utilized for beverage alcohol. Distribution points include approximately 29,000 off-premises retail locations ranging from independent bottle shops to national chains. SweetWater’s significant on-premises business allows consumers to enjoy its varietals in more than 10,000 restaurants and bars. Further, in addition to its traditional distribution footprint, SweetWater 420 Extra Pale Ale and Elevated HAZY IPA are served on all Delta Air Lines flights nationwide plus internationally totaling more than 50 countries across six continents which have served to extend SweetWater’s brand reach on both a national and international level. The Company supplements this distribution with Delta Air Lines through a kiosk in Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson Airport and secured access to distribute through an on-premise location at the Denver International Airport. SweetWater is also available in Canada through limited distribution within Ontario and Quebec.
Regulatory Environment 
 Canadian Medical and Adult-Use 
 Medical and adult-use cannabis in Canada is regulated under the federal Cannabis Act (Canada) (the “Cannabis Act”) and the Cannabis Regulations (“CR”) promulgated under the Cannabis Act. Both the Cannabis Act and CR came into force in October 2018, superseding earlier legislation that only permitted commercial distribution and home cultivation of medical cannabis. The following are the highlights of the current federal legislation:

• | a federal license is required for companies to cultivate, process and sell cannabis for medical or non-medical purposes. Health Canada, a federal government entity, is the oversight and regulatory body for cannabis licenses in Canada;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | allows individuals to purchase, possess and cultivate limited amounts of cannabis for medical purposes and, for individuals over the age of 18 years, for adult-use recreational purposes;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enables the provinces and territories to regulate other aspects associated with recreational adult-use. In particular, each province or territory may adopt its own laws governing the distribution, sale and consumption of cannabis and cannabis accessory products, and those laws may set lower maximum permitted quantities for individuals and higher age requirements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | promotion, packaging and labelling of cannabis is strictly regulated. For example, promotion is largely restricted to the place of sale and age-gated environments (i.e., environments with verification measures in place to restrict access to persons of legal age). Promotions that appeal to underage individuals are prohibited;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

United States Regulation of Hemp 
 Hemp products are subject to state and federal regulation in respect to the production, distribution and sale of products intended for human ingestion or topical application. Hemp is categorized as Cannabis sativa L., a subspecies of the cannabis genus. Numerous unique, chemical compounds are extractable from Hemp, including CBD. Hemp, as defined in the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (the “2018 Farm Bill”), is distinguishable from marijuana, which also comes from the Cannabis sativa L. subspecies, by its absence of more than trace amounts (0.3% or less) of the psychoactive compound THC. 
 The 2018 Farm Bill preserves the authority and jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), under the Food Drug & Cosmetic Act (the “FD&C Act”), to regulate the manufacture, marketing, and sale of food, drugs, dietary supplements, and cosmetics, including products that contain Hemp extracts and derivatives, such as CBD. As a result, the FD&C Act will continue to apply to Hemp-derived food, drugs, dietary supplements, cosmetics, and devices introduced, or prepared for introduction, into interstate commerce. As a producer and marketer of Hemp-derived products, the Company must comply with the FDA regulations applicable to manufacturing and marketing of certain products, including food, dietary supplements, and cosmetics.
 As a result of the 2018 Farm Bill, federal law dictates that CBD derived from Hemp is not a controlled substance; however, CBD derived from Hemp may still be considered a controlled substance under applicable state law. Individual states take varying approaches to regulating the production and sale of Hemp and Hemp-derived CBD. Some states explicitly authorize and regulate the production and sale of Hemp-derived CBD or otherwise provide legal protection for authorized individuals to engage in commercial Hemp activities. Other states, however, maintain drug laws that do not distinguish between marijuana and Hemp and/or Hemp-derived CBD which results in Hemp being classified as a controlled substance under certain state laws. 
 European Union Medical Use 
 While each country in the European Union (“EU”) has its own laws and regulations, many common practices are being adopted relative to the developing and growing medical cannabis market. For example, to ensure quality and safe products for patients, many EU countries only permit the import and sale of medical cannabis from EU-GMP certified manufacturers. 
 The EU requires adherence to EU-GMP standards for the manufacture of active substances and medicinal products, including cannabis products. The EU system for certification of GMP allows a Competent Authority of any EU member state to conduct inspections of manufacturing sites and, if the strict EU-GMP standards are met, to issue a certificate of EU-GMP compliance that is also accepted in other EU member countries.

Craft Brewing in the United States
 The alcoholic beverage industry in the United States is regulated by federal, state and local governments. These regulations govern the production, sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages, including permitting, licensing, marketing and advertising. To operate its production facilities, SweetWater must obtain and maintain numerous permits, licenses and approvals from various governmental agencies, including but not limited to, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (the “TTB”), the FDA, state alcohol regulatory agencies and state and federal environmental agencies. Our brewery operations are subject to audit and inspection by the TTB at any time. 
 In addition, the beer industry is subject to substantial federal and state excise taxes.  Excise taxes may be increased in the future by the federal government or any state government or both. In the past, increases in excise taxes on alcoholic beverages have been considered in connection with various governmental budget-balancing or funding proposals.
 
Environmental Regulation
 Our cannabis and brewing operations are subject to environmental regulations and local permitting requirements and agreements regarding, among other things, air emissions, water discharges and the handling and disposal of hazardous wastes. While we have no reason to believe the operation of our facilities violates any such regulation or requirement, if such a violation were to occur, or if environmental regulations were to become more stringent in the future, we could be adversely affected.
Competitive Conditions 
 Cannabis Market
 We continue to face intense competition from the illicit market as well as other companies, some of which may have longer operating histories and more financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience. With potential consolidation in the cannabis industry, we could face increased competition by larger and better financed competitors.
 Growers of cannabis and retailers operating in the illicit market continue to hold significant market share in Canada and are effectively competitors to our business.  Illicit market participants divert customers away through product offering, price point, anonymity and convenience. 
 Outdoor cultivation also significantly reduces the barrier to entry by reducing the start-up capital required for new entrants in the cannabis industry. It may also ultimately lower prices as capital expenditure requirements related to growing outside are typically much lower than those associated with indoor growing. Further, the licensed outdoor cultivation capacity is extremely large. While outdoor cultivation is almost exclusively extraction grade, its presence in the market will have a negative effect on pricing of extraction grade wholesale cannabis.
 As of July 2, 2021, Health Canada has issued approximately 700 active licenses to cannabis cultivators, processors and sellers. Health Canada licenses are limited to individual properties. As such, if a licensed producer seeks to commence production at a new site, it must apply to Health Canada for a new license. As of May 31, 2021, roughly 2,000 authorized retail cannabis stores have opened across Canada. As demand for legal cannabis increases and the number of authorized retail distribution points increases, we believe new competitors are likely to enter the Canadian cannabis market. Nevertheless, we believe our brand recognition combined with the quality, consistency, and variety of cannabis products we offer will allow us to maintain a prominent position in the Canadian adult use and medical markets.
 Competition is also based on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity, the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences, as well as convenience and service. 
 Internationally, the capacity of cannabis companies to operate is limited to those countries which have legalized aspects of the cultivation, distribution, sale or use of cannabis. We focused on developing assets in certain strategic international jurisdictions which maintain legalized aspects of the cannabis business. With the combination of Tilray and Aphria, we possess operational hubs in continents with significant growth opportunities and the production capability and distribution network to distribute such products throughout the region served by each hub.

The barrier to entry for competitors in these jurisdictions is significantly influenced by the national regulatory landscape with respect to cannabis and the economic climate subsisting in each region. 
 We expect more countries to pass regulation allowing for the use of medical and/or recreational cannabis. While expansion of the global cannabis market will provide more opportunities to grow our international business, we also expect to experience increased global competition.
 Craft Brewing Market
 Through SweetWater, we compete in the craft brewing market, as well as in the much larger alcohol beverage market, which encompasses domestic and imported beers, flavored alcohol beverages, spirits, wine, hard ciders and hard seltzers. With the proliferation of participants and offerings in the wider alcohol beverage market and within the craft beer segment, we face significant competition.  There have also been numerous acquisitions and investments in craft brewers by larger breweries and private equity and other investors, which further intensified competition within the craft beer market. 
 While the craft beer market is highly competitive, we believe that we possess certain competitive advantages. Our unique portfolio combines an award-winning lineup of craft beers with a unique portfolio of brands closely aligned with a cannabis lifestyle, and supported by a state-of-the-art brewery and strong distribution across the United States. Additionally, as a domestic brewery, we maintain certain competitive advantages over imported beers, such as lower transportation costs, a lack of import charges and superior product freshness.
Seasonality
 SweetWater’s sales of craft beer generally reflect a degree of seasonality, with comparatively higher sales in the summer and the winter holiday season. Typically, the demand for cannabis and hemp-based products is fairly consistent throughout the calendar year.  In addition, CC Pharma’s revenue tends to be higher in the summer months as patients increase their purchases of pharmaceutical products in order to have sufficient product on hand for summer vacations.  Moreover, the impact of COVID-19 on customer behavior and access to our products may cause temporary seasonal fluctuations or changes to our businesses. Therefore, the results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results to be achieved for the full year.
 Social and Environmental Initiatives
In an emerging and constantly evolving industry, our core values unite, inform and inspire the way we interact with employees, patients and consumers. Our commitment to our people, the planet, product quality and innovation helps us create stronger, healthier communities everywhere we do business. Our corporate social responsibility goes beyond our borders. We are committed to exporting our industry-leading knowledge and practices to our global subsidiaries. For the communities we call home, we are vigilant of the impact we have and strive to be a positive contributor to their well-being. Some of the Company’s initiatives in this regard are as follows:

• | We offer compassionate pricing for eligible patients that require financial assistance.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We employ and continuously improve, sustainable growing and business practices to provide efficiencies, cost reduction benefits and lessen our impact on the environment
