ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
------------+----------

 
As used herein, the term we, our, us, and the Company refers to Kallo, Inc., a Nevada corporation unless otherwise noted.
 
We were incorporated in the state of Nevada on December 12, 2006 as Printing Components Inc. and then changed our name to Diamond Technologies Inc. and then to our current name of Kallo Inc. On December 11, 2009, we merged with Kallo Technologies Inc. (formerly known as Rophe Medical Technologies Inc.), an Ontario corporation and its shareholders (collectively Rophe) wherein we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Rophe in exchange for 3,000,000 common shares and $1,200,000.
 
Upon acquiring Rophe, the focus of our business was to develop medical information technology software. It has since expanded to the delivery and support of what we believe may offer an end-to-end healthcare solution for developing countries and rural communities with the goal on improving all aspects of health care delivery. We have incurred over $9,000,000 in losses in 2020 and we cannot be certain that we will avoid additional losses at that level or higher.
 
Business Overview
 
We are a small company with limited financial resources and we offer what we believe may be an end-to-end health care solution that is called the Kallo Integrated Delivery System (KIDS). Our KIDS product currently consists of the following three (3) components:

1. | Care Platforms 
---+-------------------


a. | These include the care facility platforms – MobileCareTM and RuralCareTM described in more detail in the MD&A section, Dialysis care and brick and mortar hospitals as well as the emergency medical services care both land and air transportation. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Digital Technology 
---+-----------------------


a. | This component of the business includes the Electronic Medical Records (EMR), Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS), eLearning system, eGovernance solutions as well as our Tele-health solution that supports the Global and Regional response centers for real time support of medical emergencies. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Education & Training 
---+-------------------------


a. | This component includes the education and training for all aspects of healthcare management – clinical including clinical informatics, engineering including bio-medical, information and communications technology and health administration. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Each of these components are currently included in the full KIDS solution but can also be used as individual components to enhance an existing health care infrastructure.
 
Our Copyrighted Technologies: 
 
While we believe that our technologies are protected under Canadian and International copyrights and are authored by and owned by John Cecil., we have not obtained any evaluation of the extent of our copyright or other intellectual property right claims by any independent third party and we have no present plans to obtain any such evaluation at this time. And in that context, we believe that Kallo Inc. has the rights to the products referred in this section, of which items B, C, and D (listed below) are under development and we anticipate that they will likely require further development work. There can be no assurance that we will not later discover that the extent of our copyright claims are limited and/or that we may be subject to claims of infringement asserted by other persons. In that event we may be exposed to significant and protracted litigation with likely consequential and serious financial losses resulting thereby.

Our Products in Development
 
Our product portfolio includes three earlier stage products listed below, all of which highlight the broad applicability of our proprietary technologies to what we believe may offer us potential future product opportunities if market conditions allow and in that event we plan to evaluate partnership opportunities for further development and commercialization of these products.

1. | The company has Copyrighted Technology EMR Integration Engine that demonstrate the future direction for integrated solutions as well as current efforts that illustrate interoperability within the continuum of care. EMR Integration Engine is software, which connects all the other applications in or outside a hospital/clinic with the EMR system. This enables the doctor/nurse to seamlessly access information in other healthcare applications without moving from one computer to the next. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | C&ID-IMS is an Internet-based solution for monitoring and managing Communicable and Infectious Disease information. Our target markets are Health Organizations and Ministries of Health, hospitals and Center for Disease Control (CDC) & the World Health Organization (WHO) members around the globe. While we believe that our technologies are protected under Canadian and International copyrights and are authored by and owned by John Cecil, we have not obtained any third-party independent evaluation of the extent of our copyright or other intellectual property right claims by any independent third-party and we have no present plans to obtain any such evaluation. And in that context, we believe that Kallo Inc. has the rights to the products referred in this section, of which items B, C, and D (listed below) are under development and we anticipate that they will likely require further development work. There can be no assurance that we will not later discover that the extent of our copyright claims are limited and/or that we may be subject to claims of infringement asserted by other persons.

3. | CCG is our clinical-care globalization technology. We believe that this product may, if market and competitive conditions allow, offer us an opportunity to respond to the growing medical tourism phenomenon - patients going to low-cost countries for elective medical procedures. Based on our own internal and limited assessment undertaken without any independent third -party evaluation, we believe that this may be a fast-growing worldwide industry segment that may be actively promoted by certain countries. In that sense, it may be that CCG may be used by both the destination and home country of a patient to maintain complete and accurate records of the treatment history, avoiding errors due to incomplete patient data and lessening the burden and expense of corrective action on the home country when medical tourists return home. But we also know that any such growth in this segment will likely be subject to then current laws and regulations in addition to other factors over which we have no control.

4. | MC-Telehealth (Mobile Clinic with Telehealth system) is our planned mobile clinic long distance or Telehealth technology. We believe that our product, if properly installed and used, may allow the remote transmission of standardized formats of data for laboratory information, diagnostic imaging, diagnosis and clinical notes. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | KIDS (Kallo Integrated Delivery System), a Technology & process framework defines and describes the component parts of the various products and services that Kallo is delivering to its clients, including the human resources component, and how these parts interact and relate to one another. The framework also recognizes the need for collaboration with local care facilities, services and providers to support continuity of care and facilitate patient transport between facilities. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | KIDS (Kallo Integrated Delivery System) Global Tele-Health Ecosystems. The Tele-health Program encompasses the broad variety of Technologies and administrative processes needed to deliver virtual medical care, health promotion/prevention and other patient education to KIDS patients. If properly installed and managed, we believe that our tele-health program may serve to facilitate synchronous and asynchronous interactions where patients or care providers are in different locations. The KIDS system includes scheduling, information delivery and care management services that we believe may offer opportunities to enhance the delivery of healthcare services if the system is properly installed and managed. Overall, we have conducted only a limited amount of internal evaluation of our technology and our planned business operations. That is, we have not engaged or secured any independent third-party evaluation of our technology, our copyright claims, and our planned business operations and even our business model. In that respect there is a clear risk that we may later discover that our limited internal management assessments are materially inaccurate and in one or more respects we have made inaccurate assumptions regarding the willingness of the marketplace to adopt, accept or utilize all of our technology and/or the business model that we have adopted. We may also discover that our copyright claims are invalid and conflict with superior claims asserted by other persons with the result we are exposed to conflicting claims with resulting liability thereby. To the extent that our assumptions and/or our business model is materially inaccurate or fails to address the needs of the healthcare marketplace, we will likely incur significant and protracted financial losses thereby.

Target Market
 
Based on our current internal management assessments undertaken without the benefit of any independent third-party review or evaluation, we believe that our primary target market for the Kallo Integrated Delivery System (KIDS) may be one or more selected markets in certain developing countries where health care services are limited and where we may be able to enter into what we hope may be commercially feasible contractual arrangements without undue and unacceptable risks and challenges. To that end and in anticipation that we may be successful in these efforts, we have established several sales and marketing partnership agreements under Business Associate section either representing Kallo independently or as an organization. While we are currently in various stages of our sales cycle with more than 10 countries, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in these efforts or, if we are successful, that we can implement and undertake our business plans without incurring significant and protracted losses and negative cash flow. Yet, we have incurred over $9,000,000 in losses in 2020 and we cannot be certain that we will avoid additional losses at that level or higher.
 
Additionally, with the components of our KIDS solution, we are targeting markets where, if our financial resources and market conditions allow, we believe we may be able to offer complimentary services to existing health care infrastructures. These markets currently include the following:
 

● | Communicable & Infectious disease Information Management System – supporting World Health Organization (WHO) and Center for Disease Control (CDC); $200B market 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Electronic Medical Records integration engine for Health Information Access Layer – focused on clinics, hospitals, IDC & IHC; $100B market 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Clinical Care Globalization – focused on medical tourism; $40B market 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Mobile Medical Clinics – focused on disaster recovery management and rural community health services for wide range of services, HIV monitoring, chemotherapy, acute care, dialysis, etc; $30B market However, we are acutely aware that market conditions are ever-changing and we can not assure you that we can undertake these efforts, or if we do, that we can do so without incurring significant and protracted losses and negative cash flow. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intellectual Property and Research and Development
 
If market conditions and our financial resources allow, we anticipate that we likely will continue our efforts in research and development through collaborations with medical faculties in Canada and the United States on an ongoing basis where our company stands to benefit from the technology ownership of the treatment or diagnostic systems developed for commercial use.
 
Since 2016, we decreased our expenses relating to research and development but we anticipate that we will, if market conditions and our financial resources allow, continue our research and development work on the Mobile Clinic and Telehealth system, which we anticipate will may1 be in demand in the future if our internal management assessments are accurate and market conditions do not become unfavorable.
 
Competition
 
We are a small company with limited financial resources. We compete with many larger, well-established entities in various sectors; mobile clinic and temporary medical facility manufacturers, health care equipment resellers, EMR developers, health care education providers, EMS contracted services, etc. Our competitors tend to be focused on a component of our health care solution, but do have established histories in their particular area of expertise affording them a resource advantage. We are effectively in the start-up phase of operations and as a result, we have little or no impact upon our competition. We believe that, if market conditions and our financial resources allow, we may be able to offer a fully integrated solution. In the opportunities that we have been engaged in, we have not encountered a competitor that offers the full end to end solution that we are offering in the marketplace.

Managements View of the Market Trend
 
The Intelligence Unit of The Economist published a report in 2017 recognizing that access to healthcare is a key topic of debate worldwide and that countries are facing a range of healthcare challenges.
 
In 2016, they developed the Global Access to Healthcare Index to measure how healthcare systems across 60 countries are working to address their most pressing healthcare needs.
 
As shown in Chart 1 below, the index is based on a set of accessibility and healthcare-system measures. The accessibility domain measures access to specific kinds of care and the healthcare systems domain measures access to effective and relevant healthcare services such as policy, institutions, and infrastructure.
 

One of the primary findings of this report is that much more needs to be done to develop and extend coverage, the geographical reach of infrastructure, equity of access, and efficiency to improve the sustainability of health systems.
 
Specifically, the key findings of the report are as follows:
 

1. | Political will and a social compact are prerequisites for both access and sustainable health systems. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Public investment underpins good access and demonstrates the commitment of governments to ensuring the health of their populations. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Universal coverage does not mean universal access, but extending universal health coverage (UHC) can be a crucial part of improving access. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Access to data is fundamental. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | A well-trained and integrated workforce is the backbone of a sustainable healthcare system. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | Good primary care is a vital building block for good access. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As might be expected, the index reveals that developed countries are performing much better in all areas compared with developing countries. For example, Chart 8 below identifies the lowest performing countries in the area of equity of access to healthcare.

The report also recognizes that many developing countries have shown significant improvements in their efforts to meet the UNs Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and the countries that have signed up to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have agreed to aim for a 40% reduction in premature deaths by 2030. As part of the SDGs, countries have pledged to reduce child and maternal deaths and mortality from tuberculosis, HIV and malaria by two-thirds, and deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and other causes by one-third. Yet it is increasingly clear that insufficient investment in healthcare, particularly in the developing world, has led to disparities in health outcomes globally.
 
Over the last couple of decades we have noted that there have been growing multilateral efforts to encourage countries to increase the amount of money they spend on healthcare. The WHO has recommended that countries spend a minimum of 5% of GDP on health in order to be taken seriously on provision of access. Meanwhile, in the Abuja Declaration of 2001 the heads of state of African Union countries pledged to set a target of allocating at least 15% of their budgets to improving healthcare. Over a decade later, however, many of them were still making insufficient progress.
 
The extensive work that Kallo has done over the past 10 years studying the health challenges faced by many African countries has led to the design of our comprehensive healthcare delivery solution which addresses all of the key findings of this report.
 
With respect to the importance of political will, Kallos approach of working closely with the government, providing a national healthcare system tailored to the specific needs of the country and Kallos commitment to providing ongoing support helps to engender the political will that developing countries need to achieve success.
 
With respect to the importance of public investment in healthcare, Kallo is helping to address this need by providing innovative financing options which allow developing countries to make the needed healthcare investments without creating undue negative economic impact.
 
With respect to the issue of universal health coverage, the report states that there is an important distinction to be made between the ability to access healthcare services and its successful delivery to a wide population. Further, the report states that a right to healthcare may be guaranteed in law, but not actually available in reality, especially in remote and underdeveloped regions. Kallos KIDS solution specifically recognizes the importance of extending universal health coverage through the innovative use of a variety of care platforms that can reach the unreached while using technology to ensure that the access to healthcare services is available to all the citizens of a country.
  -6-

 
With respect to access to data, we believe that our KIDS solution includes state-of-the-art integrated electronic medical records and hospital information systems to gather and process the data that is critical to allowing governance structures to effectively oversee the entire healthcare system.
 
With regards to the importance of a well-trained and integrated workforce, Kallo has recognized the importance of providing education and training to local healthcare practitioners by establishing Kallo University which collaborates with teaching institutions and hospitals in Canada to provide a wide range of these services.
 
With respect to the importance of good primary care, our KIDS solution specifically focuses on providing primary care through all of its care platforms as well as providing specialized care as required.
 
Through all of Kallos extensive study of the healthcare challenges of developing countries and as confirmed by the key findings of this Economist Intelligence Unit report, we believe that our comprehensive KIDS solution and our approach to working directly with the governments of developing countries provides the greatest opportunity for achieving success in significantly improving access to world class healthcare services for all. 
 
Government Regulation and Compliance
 
The healthcare regulations and standards vary widely in the geographic areas that we are focused in, with the primary concerns around patient health, safety, and privacy. With rapid advances in clinical and technology changes, the increased scrutiny by governments, the media and consumers has created continual monitoring and increased regulation on drug and patient safety specifically.
 
Within the global market that we serve, North America has some of the most stringent regulations and standards for medical technology and pharmaceutical approvals. As such, we have partnered with a number of major biomedical devices/equipment suppliers to ensure the highest standards of equipment. If we are successful, we intend to utilize only the highest standards of product regardless of the market that we are serving. 
 
Employees
 
As of February 22, 2021, we have four full time employees.
 
Warranties
 
We do not provide warranties in connection with our products or services. Our third party products are supplied with the manufacturers warranty and we offer additional coverage with a service agreement.
Insurance
 
We currently do not have insurance but, if our financial resources allow, we plan to obtain general liability and other insurance as appropriate.
 
Executive Offices
 
Our administrative office is located at 255 Duncan Mill Road, Suite 504, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, M3B 3H9, our telephone number is (416) 246-9997. Our registered agent for services of process is the Corporation Trust Company of Nevada, located at 6100 Neil Road, Suite 500, Reno, Nevada 89511. Our fiscal year end is December 31st.
