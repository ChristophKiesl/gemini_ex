ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company and were formed in May 2017 to initially focus on developing new generation therapies for dermatological disorders. We believe that our pipeline has the potential to improve the quality of life for patients suffering from indications including atopic dermatitis (also known as eczema), chronic wounds, psoriasis, asthma and acne. Since our formation, we have expanded our business to also focus on developing (i) a topical formulation for treating side effects from drugs used for the treatment of cancer; (ii) a treatment for asthma and allergies using inhalational administration; (iii) a topical treatment for patients with lupus; (iv) a treatment for mast-cell derived cancers and anaphylaxis; and (v) a treatment for lung diseases resulting from bacterial infections. We are also focused on potentially developing a COVID-19 treatment as well as a diagnostic device for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 via a mobile device.
Dermatological Disorders
 
The BioLexa Platform
 
We have obtained an exclusive license from the University of Cincinnati to make, use, have made, import, offer for sale, and sell products based upon or involving the use of (i) topical compositions comprising a zinc chelator and gentamicin and (ii) zinc chelators to inhibit biofilm formation (the “BioLexa Platform” or “BioLexa”). The license enables us to develop the platform for any indications in humans.
 
The BioLexa Platform is a proprietary, patented, drug compound platform for the treatment of eczema. It combines an FDA-approved zinc chelator with one or more approved antibiotics in a topical dosage form to address unchecked eczema flare-ups by preventing the formation of infectious biofilms and the resulting clogging of sweat ducts. We intend to initially use the BioLexa Platform to develop two different topical cream products: (i) a product to treat eczema and (ii) a product that reduces post-procedure infections, accelerates healing and improves clinical outcomes for patients undergoing aesthetic dermatology procedures.
 
The technology is based on scientific research into the mechanism of Staphylococcus biofilm formation conducted by Andrew B. Herr, PhD at the University of Cincinnati. Dr. Herr conducted multiple in-vitro experiments, or experiments conducted in a controlled environment outside of a living organism, demonstrating that chelation of zinc can prevent Staphylococcus bacteria from forming complex colonies called a biofilm. Biofilms are used by bacteria as a defense mechanism against the host immune response and antibiotics. Prevention of the biofilm formation leaves the bacteria in their planktonic, or single cell state and susceptible to host immune defenses and antibiotic therapy. Dr. Herr’s in-vitro work demonstrating that zinc is an enabler for staph-biofilm formation led to the design and implementation of a series of in-vivo experiments, or experiments conducted using living organisms. These experiments were conducted at the University of Miami using a minipig wound infection model and intended to demonstrate that the combination of zinc removal, or chelation, and broad spectrum antibiotic therapy was more effective than either approach on its own. These positive results supported development of the BioLexa Platform for multiple indications with staph-biofilms as the causative agent.
 
We intend to develop the BioLexa Platform for use in patients following the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) rules. Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) was enacted to enable sponsors to seek New Drug Application (“NDA”) approval for novel repurposed drugs without the need for such sponsors to undertake time consuming and expensive pre-clinical safety studies and Phase 1 safety studies. Proceeding under this regulatory pathway, we will be able to rely upon publicly available data with respect to gentamicin and zinc chelator in our NDA submission to the FDA for marketing approval.
 
In September 2018, we attended the first of a series of meetings with the FDA to review the requirements for submission and activation of an investigational new drug application (“IND”) with respect to the BioLexa Platform for use in eczema. We prepared and presented to the FDA our proposed first in human clinical trial plan for the treatment of eczema in patients over the age of one year old, and the FDA provided us with general guidance with respect to specific animal studies, dosing schedules and suggested human safety studies before we commence clinical trials in pediatric or adult patients. The FDA requested that safety and efficacy of BioLexa be established in adults prior to investigating pediatric and adolescent patients. Therefore, we planned to conduct our first clinical trial for BioLexa in Australia in order to enroll both adult and adolescents to support future clinical development.

On August 13, 2020, we submitted our application for approval to conduct our clinical trial of BioLexa to the Belberry Human Research Ethics Committee (“HREC”) in Australia and received approval from HREC on December 9, 2020. We have engaged Novotech (Australia) Pty Limited as our local clinical research organization in Australia to provide clinical management, data management, biostatistical, medical monitoring, pharmacovigilance, and other related services to support the first in human clinical trial of BioLexa.
 
We believe that the key elements for our market success with respect to BioLexa include:
 

● | the proprietary formulation of two FDA-approved drugs to treat bacterial proliferation which may reduce development time and costs by giving us the ability to rely on safety and efficacy data from the two approved drugs; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | our proprietary formulation is not a topical corticosteroid, and provides a novel mechanism of action and potentially a preferred safety profile as a market differentiator; and 
● | the recent literature set forth below reaffirms the critical role that S. aureus plays in the development of atopic dermatitis flare-ups within the international medical community, supporting the targeted mechanism of action of BioLexa. Shi et al, “MRSA Colonization is Associated with Decreased Skin Commensal Bacteria in Atopic Dermatitis,” Invest Dermatol. 2018. Blicharz, et al, “Staphylococcus aureus: an underestimated factor in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis?,” Adv Dermatol Allergol 2019. 

 
HT-001
 
On February 1, 2020, we entered into a patent license agreement with The George Washington University (“GW”) pursuant to which GW granted us a license to certain patent rights to, among other things, make, use, offer and sell certain licensed products throughout the world with respect to HT-001 which we intend to potentially use for treating dermatological side effects from epidermal growth factor receptor (“EGFR”) inhibitors, and potentially other drugs used for the treatment of cancer. HT-001 is a topical formulation under development for the treatment of patients with rash and skin disorders associated with initial and repeat courses of tyrosine kinase EGFR inhibitor therapy. EGFR inhibitors are used for the treatment of cancers with EGFR up-regulation (such as non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer and colon cancer); however, EGFR inhibitors are often associated with dose-limiting skin toxicities that can result in the interruption or reduction of treatment. HT-001 is targeted to treat these EGFR-induced skin disorders to allow patients to achieve the best potential outcomes of EGFR therapy. HT-001 has achieved positive results in its initial pre-clinical studies conducted at GW. In December 2020, we submitted a pre-IND meeting request to the FDA with respect to HT-001 as a concomitant therapy with EGFR inhibitors. In preparation for such pre-IND meeting, we prepared and submitted to the FDA our IND-opening clinical trial plan in January 2021, which includes two phase 2 trials conducted in patients. Based on the FDA’s feedback, we intend to advance our IND-enabling activities for HT-001 as planned.
 
We believe that the key elements for our market success with respect to HT-001 include:
 

● | To our knowledge, there are currently no drugs approved for the treatment of skin toxicities associated with EFGR inhibitor therapy and 49-100% of patients develop skin toxicities during EGFR inhibitory therapy;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The main active ingredient of HT-001 is already approved in oral and IV dosage forms which supports pursuit of the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway to reduce development time and cost;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | To our knowledge, there are no current topical formulations available using HT-001’s active ingredient so we believe that there is no direct market competition; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We have the potential to pursue other indications such as chronic pruritus, atopic dermatitis and other skin toxicities that develop from anti-cancer therapies using the HT-001 formulation.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HT-003
 
On July 30, 2020 (the “Isoprene Effective Date”), we entered into a Sublicense Agreement (the “Isoprene Sublicense Agreement”) with Isoprene Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Isoprene”) pursuant to the commercial evaluation sublicense and option agreement dated March 8, 2019 by and among us, the University of Maryland, Baltimore and Isoprene. Pursuant to the Isoprene Sublicense Agreement, Isoprene granted us an exclusive sublicense to certain intellectual property (i) to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell and import certain licensed products, (ii) in connection therewith, to use certain inventions and licensed materials and (iii) to practice certain patent rights for the treatment of dermatological conditions or diseases, referred to as HT-003.
 
Retinoids, which include Vitamin A (retinol) and its analogues (both synthetic and metabolites), play a critical role in cell signaling and biological processes, including regulation of immune cells and inflammation, signaling pathways that control normal skin maintenance, embryonic development and cell growth/differentiation/repair. Deficiencies in retinoids and their active metabolites have been implicated in a wide variety of diseases. In the skin, retinol deficiency leads to hyperkeratosis and keratinizing metaplasia that is observed in skin disorders like psoriasis and acne. Vitamin A and retinoic acid also play a crucial role in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis and therefore, altered metabolism of retinoids has been suspected as playing a potential role in tumorigenesis. Accordingly, retinoids have been approved in the US for treatment of acne and psoriasis as well as other therapeutic indications such as acute promyelocytic leukemia and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma; however, the therapeutic use of exogenous retinoids has been limited due to negative effects associated with high systemic concentrations. A new therapeutic approach to increase intracellular retinoic acid (the active metabolite of retinol) potentially without causing negative side effects of exogenous retinoic acid is to use inhibitors of retinoic acid metabolism (collectively, “RAMBAs”), which prolong the presence of retinoic acid. HT-003 is a novel RAMBA under investigation for topical treatment in acne and psoriasis applications.
 
In December 2019, we entered into a research collaboration agreement with Weill Cornell Medicine for the completion of pre-clinical studies investigating the mechanism of action of HT-003 that was renewed in January 2021 as a result of positive preclinical results. Dr. Jonathan Zippin, M.D., Ph.D., FAAD, Associate Professor of Dermatology at Weill Cornell Medicine and our Senior Scientific Advisor, is the principal investigator for such pre-clinical studies.
 
The RAMBAs have the potential to be developed as a platform for multiple inflammatory-based indications. Accordingly, on December 22, 2020, we entered into an option agreement to expand the therapeutic indication of the sublicensed RAMBAs from Isoprene. The option agreement includes the investigation of RAMBAs for treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases, including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Preclinical proof-of-concept studies began in the first quarter of 2021.
 
HT-005 Z-Pods™
 
On August 19, 2019, we entered into a sublicense agreement with Zylö Therapeutics, Inc. (“Zylö”) pursuant to which Zylö granted us an exclusive sublicense to certain licensed patent rights and certain licensed technology to, among other things, develop, make and sell certain licensed products and to practice certain licensed technology in the United States and Canada initially with respect to therapeutic uses related to lupus in humans. HT-005 Z-Pods™ include a novel topical delivery matrix (Z-Pods™) loaded with an endogenous ligand with suspected immune-modulating action. Z-Pods™ use patented xerogel-derived nanoparticles for sustained and controlled topical delivery of active pharmaceutical ingredients. In 2020, Zylö completed positive proof of concept data in a lupus mouse model to support further development activities in 2021.
 
Genetic Marker for Food Allergies
 
On May 18, 2018, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the University of Cincinnati for a patented, novel genetic marker for food allergies. The genetic marker licensed may be used to (i) identify at risk infants in predicting food allergies, including peanut and milk allergies, (ii) identify a person’s predisposition to an allergic reaction and (iii) determine an individual’s propensity to develop atopic dermatitis, such as eczema. We intend to utilize the genetic marker in the future for purposes of determining an individual’s propensity to develop eczema as well as to identify and treat allergies in at-risk infants.
Respiratory Products
 
HT-004
 
On November 20, 2019, we entered into a license agreement with North Carolina State University (“NC State”) pursuant to which NC State granted us an exclusive license to, among other things, develop, make, use, offer and sell certain licensed products throughout the world with respect to HT-004 for treating allergic diseases. HT-004 is a potential disease-modifying agent that uses exon-skipping oligonucleotide-targeted methods to reduce mast cell responses to immunoglobulin E (IgE)-directed antigens, which is one of the key mechanisms in the pathophysiology of asthma, atopic dermatitis and other allergic diseases. HT-004 is currently under investigation for the treatment of asthma and allergies using inhalational administration.

-


Preclinical proof-of-concept data was generated in October 2020 supporting efficacy of HT-004 after inhalational delivery in a mouse model. Critical proof-of-concept studies in a humanized mouse model are planned to be conducted in 2021. These studies are being conducted by our Scientific Advisory Board member, Dr. Glenn Cruse, at NC State.
 
We believe that the key elements for our market success with respect to HT-004 include:
 

● | To our knowledge, there are currently no disease-modifying agents for asthma or allergy diseases;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The active pharmaceutical ingredient in HT-004 is a novel molecular class that we believe would prevent generic competition after commercialization;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | HT-004 is being developed for inhalational administration by either inhaler or nebulizer for easy access at home by patients; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | HT-004 is applicable for both adult and pediatric patient populations with asthma and/or allergies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
HT-006
 
On December 22, 2020, we entered into a non-exclusive commercial evaluation license agreement with the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command (“USAMRDC”), as amended, pursuant to which USAMRDC granted us a non-exclusive commercial evaluation license to HT-006 for the treatment of lung diseases resulting from bacterial infections. We will initially target treatment of serious bacterial infections of the lung, such as hospital-acquired pneumonia (“HAP”) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (“VAP”). Given the indication, we intend to develop HT-006 for inhalational administration.
 
Both HAP and VAP are considered life-threatening diseases for which current treatment options are limited or not effective against multi-drug resistance bacteria. As such, we intend to pursue streamlined development opportunities under the FDA’s program for “antibacterial therapies for patients with an unmet medical need for the treatment of serious bacterial diseases.” This streamlined program allows for the use of nonclinical animal studies to reduce clinical studies required for approval.
 
We intend to begin proof-of-concept preclinical testing in the first quarter of 2021.
 
Cancer Treatments
 
HT-KIT
 
We have obtained from NC State an exclusive, worldwide, royalty bearing license to certain intellectual property to, among other things, discover, develop, make, have made, use and sell certain licensed products and sell, use and practice certain licensed services with respect to cancer and anaphylaxis; this is being developed as HT-KIT. The HT-KIT drug is designed to more specifically target the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT in mast cells, which is required for the proliferation, survival and differentiation of bone marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cells. Mutations in the KIT pathway have been associated with several human cancers, such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors and mast cell-derived cancers (mast cell leukemia and mast cell sarcoma). Based on the initial proof-of-concept success, we intend to initially target mast cell neoplasms for development of HT-KIT, which is a rare, aggressive cancer with poor prognosis.
 
The same target, KIT, also plays a key role in mast cell-mediated anaphylaxis, a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death. Anaphylaxis typically occurs after exposure to an external allergen that results in an immediate and severe immune response. We also intend to pursue the anaphylaxis indication for HT-KIT in parallel to cancer treatment.
 
COVID-19 Products
 
HT-002
 
On May 18, 2020, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with the Virginia Commonwealth University Intellectual Property Foundation (“VCU”) pursuant to which VCU granted us an exclusive, royalty bearing license to HT-002, a novel peptide developed by researchers at VCU that may be used to slow the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (the “VCU Peptide”) and a non-exclusive royalty bearing, worldwide license with respect to certain licensed technical information patents to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell and import certain licensed products and perform certain licensed services. On June 29, 2020, we entered into a Sponsored Project Agreement with VCU for the development of a potential COVID-19 treatment using the VCU Peptide.
 
Proof-of-Concept preclinical studies are expected to be completed in 2021.

VaxCelerate SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine
 
On March 23, 2020, we entered into a Royalty and Development Agreement (the “Voltron Agreement”) with Voltron Therapeutics, Inc. (“Voltron”), pursuant to which we formed a joint venture entity named HaloVax, LLC (“HaloVax”), to jointly develop potential product candidates for the prevention of COVID-19 based upon certain technology that had been exclusively licensed by Voltron from The General Hospital Corporation (d/b/a Massachusetts General Hospital) (“Mass Gen”). The SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is being developed using VaxCelerate, a self-assembling vaccine platform licensed from Mass Gen by HaloVax. VaxCelerate offers two unique elements to combat SARS-CoV-2: a fixed immune adjuvant and variable immune targeting, the combination which is designed to illicit a robust, protective immune response.
 
Critical IND-enabling preclinical studies are planned to be completed in 2021.
 
On-the-Go Sars-Cov-2 Testing Device
 
On August 7, 2020, we entered into a patent license agreement (the “GW Patent License Agreement”) with GW pursuant to which GW granted us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty bearing license to certain intellectual property that can be used to develop a device designed to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, the GW Patent License Agreement permits us to make, have made, use, import, offer for sale and sell certain licensed products in the field of virus sensing and detection. On September 17, 2020, we entered into a sponsored research agreement with GW relating to the development of a diagnostic device for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 via a mobile device as an aid in the diagnosis of the COVID-19 infection.
Product Development Pipeline
 
The following table summarizes our product development pipeline.
 

Competition
 
The biopharmaceutical industry utilizes rapidly advancing technologies and is characterized by intense competition. There is also a strong emphasis on intellectual property and proprietary products. In the segment of the biopharmaceutical industry, competition from different sources including major biopharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies, and public and private research institutions will continue. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in product candidate development and may have progressed further toward approval and marketing. In addition, smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
Manufacturing and Supply
 
We do not have any manufacturing capability and therefore we currently rely on and intend to continue to rely on contract manufacturing organizations to produce our product candidates in accordance with regulatory requirements.
Commercialization
 
Our success depends not only on the successful development and approval of our products candidates but also on the commercialization of our potential products. If and when our product candidates receive regulatory approval, we intend to engage third-parties such as pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the commercialization of our products.

Intellectual Property Portfolio
 
Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the U.S. and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our products, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world. In addition, we intend to actively pursue product life-cycle management initiatives to extend our market exclusivity.
 
We intend to cement our market exclusivity in conjunction with our formulation-development partners through additional patents based on the pharmaceutical and clinical characteristics of our product candidates in the proprietary formulation and through the introduction of line extensions such as combination drugs and new formulations.
 
In addition to any granted patents, our products may be eligible for market exclusivity to run concurrently with the term of the patent for three and a half years in the U.S. pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman Act and pediatric exclusivity guideline and up to ten years of market exclusivity in the E.U. which includes eight years of data exclusivity and two years of market exclusivity from the date we file an NDA or the European equivalent referred to as Marketing Authorization Application.
 
Government Regulations
 
Governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries extensively regulate the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing of pharmaceutical products, including biological products, and medical devices, such as those being developed by us. In the U.S., the FDA regulates such products under the FDCA and the Public Health Services Act and implements related regulations. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements, both before and after approval, may subject us to administrative and judicial sanctions, such as a delay in approving or refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution.
U.S. Food and Drug Administration Regulations
 
United States Drug Development
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs (including biological products, such as vaccines), medical devices and combinations of drugs and devices, or combination products, under the FDCA and its implementing regulations. These products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, requests for voluntary product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

● | completion of extensive pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with an applicable IND and other clinical study related regulations, sometimes referred to as good clinical practices (“GCPs”) to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its proposed indication;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an NDA or biologics license application (“BLA”);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) requirements;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-


Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 

● | Phase 1. The product is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product is suspected or known to be unavoidably toxic, the initial human testing may be conducted in patients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2. Involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 trials. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”), which oversees the conduct of clinical trials, can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. The clinical trial sponsor may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
 FDA Review Process
 
The results of product development, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug, or BLA for a biological product, requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee, and the sponsor of an approved NDA or BLA is also subject to an annual program user fee; although a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
 
The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), the FDA’s goal to complete its substantive review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant is ten months from the receipt of the NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification and may go through multiple review cycles.
 
The review and evaluation of an NDA or BLA by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete, and we may not receive a timely approval, if at all.
 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements.
 
There is no assurance that the FDA will ultimately approve a product for marketing in the United States, and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs during the review process. If a product receives marketing approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling or may condition the approval of the NDA or BLA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-market testing or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 clinical trials to further assess drug safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals, including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”), to assure the safe use of the drug.

Section 505(b)(2) Regulatory Approval Pathway
 
Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA provides an alternate regulatory pathway for approval of a new drug by allowing the FDA to rely on data not developed by the applicant. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of an NDA where one or more of the investigations relied upon by the applicant for approval was not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon published literature and/or the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved drug already on the market. Approval or submission of a 505(b)(2) application, like those for abbreviated new drugs (“ANDAs”), may be delayed because of patent and/or exclusivity rights that apply to the previously approved drug.
 
A 505(b)(2) application may be submitted for a new chemical entity (“NCE”) when some part of the data necessary for approval is derived from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and when the applicant has not obtained a right of reference.
 
Section 505(b)(2) applications also may be entitled to marketing exclusivity if supported by appropriate data and information. Three-year new data exclusivity may be granted to the 505(b)(2) application if one or more clinical investigations conducted in support of the application, other than bioavailability/bioequivalence studies, were essential to the approval and conducted or sponsored by the applicant. Five years of marketing exclusivity may be granted if the application is for an NCE, and pediatric exclusivity is likewise available.
 
Orange Book Listing and Paragraph IV Certification
 
For NDA submissions, including those under Section 505(b)(2), applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents with claims that cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval, each of the patents listed in the application is published in Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly referred to as the Orange Book. Any applicant who subsequently files an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA that references a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a Paragraph IV Certification.
 
If an applicant has provided a Paragraph IV Certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV Certification to the holder of the NDA for the approved drug and the patent owner once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA holder or patent owner may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to notice of the Paragraph IV Certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV Certification prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of 30 months from the date of the lawsuit, the applicant’s successful defense of the suit, or expiration of the patent.
 
United States Medical Device Regulation 
 
Medical devices, including diagnostic test devices, also are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA under the FDCA, as well as other federal and state regulatory bodies in the United States, and laws and regulations of foreign authorities in other countries. FDA requirements specific to medical devices are wide ranging and govern, among other things, the design, development and manufacturing, human clinical trials, preclearance or approval, advertising and promotion, and product import and export. Unless an exemption applies, medical devices distributed in the United States must receive either premarket clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDCA or premarket approval of a premarket application (“PMA”). During the COVID-19 public health emergency, the FDA has authorized COVID-19 diagnostic tests under its Emergency Use Authorization authority. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II, or Class III—depending on the degree or risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Medical devices deemed to pose relatively low risk are placed in either Class I or II. Class II devices generally require the manufacturer to submit a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission for commercial distribution. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices are placed in Class III requiring PMA approval.
Reimbursement
 
Potential sales of any of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, at least in part, on the extent to which such products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage and/or reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. A third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our future revenues and results of operations. Decreases in third-party reimbursement or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover a product candidate, if approved, or any future approved products could reduce physician usage of our products, and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
 
In the United States, the Medicare Part D program provides a voluntary outpatient drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries for certain products. We do not know whether our product candidates, if approved, will be eligible for coverage under Medicare Part D, but individual Medicare Part D plans offer coverage subject to various factors such as those described above. Furthermore, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policies and payment limitations in setting their own coverage policies.

Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 
Sales of our product candidates, if approved, or any other future product candidate will be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we might conduct our business. The healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include the following:

● | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is in exchange for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Federal false claims and false statement laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent. 
● | Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors or making any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 


● | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 and their implementing regulations, impose obligations on certain types of individuals and entities regarding the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.

 
Also, many states have similar laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, we may be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the federal government’s and/or pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines, state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, as well as state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA.
 
Additionally, to the extent that our product is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
