Company Overview
Commvault Systems, Inc. is a global data protection and information management software company offering customers enterprise level, intelligent data management solutions built from the ground up on a single platform and unified code base. Commvault was incorporated in Delaware in 1996. 
At Commvault, we believe in solving hard problems for our customers. To do this, we provide capabilities which enable our customers to accelerate their digital transformation in today's ever evolving workforce using tools that are light touch and utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning to drive automation. Our product portfolio empowers our customers to reduce complexity, reign in data fragmentation, and accelerate their cloud journey. All software functionality shares the same back-end technologies to deliver the benefits of a holistic approach to protecting, managing, and accessing data. Our software addresses many aspects of storage and data management in the enterprise, while providing scalability and control of data and information. We believe our technology provides the broadest set of capabilities in the industry, which allows customers to reduce storage costs and administrative overhead. We also provide our customers with a broad range of professional services.
Products
Commvault provides a portfolio of intelligent data management solutions that help organizations securely manage their data without increasing costs or complexity. These offerings are organized into three categories - (1) Data Protection, (2) Data Insights and (3) Storage. 
All of Commvault's products are managed seamlessly through a single view. The Commvault Command Center is our user interface for managing data protection and disaster recovery initiatives. It provides default configuration values and streamlined procedures for routine data protection and recovery tasks. Customers can use the Command Center to set up their data protection environment, identify content that they want to protect, and initiate and monitor backups and restores. The main navigation pane allows customers to easily access various components including downloads, forms, analytics, monitoring and more. This provides a controlled foundation for self-service, helping to reduce the load on administrators and IT support staff. 
Data Protection
Commvault Backup and Recovery is designed to meet the needs of any size business and covers workloads across all locations: hybrid environments include on-premises and multiple cloud providers; physical servers; virtual machines; applications and databases; endpoint devices; cloud applications and more. Commvault Backup and Recovery provides backup, verifiable recovery and cost-optimized cloud workload mobility, helping to ensure data availability, even across multiple clouds. Our simplified backup and recovery solution allows customers to manage all workloads – cloud, virtual machines ("VMs"), containers, applications, databases and endpoints – from a single platform, while flexible copy data management allows users to multi-purpose backed-up data for DevOps, replication and more, across your entire infra-structure.
Commvault Disaster Recovery provides an easy-to-use replication and disaster recovery solution from a single extensible platform, all managed through an intuitive user interface. Commvault’s standalone disaster recovery solution is both easy to implement and cost-effective. It provides orchestration and automated compliance reporting, flexible replication, cost-optimized cloud data mobility, and verifiable recoverability via copy data management.
Commvault Complete Data Protection is a comprehensive, yet easy-to-use data protection solution that combines Commvault Backup and Recovery with Commvault Disaster Recovery. It delivers backup, replication, and disaster recovery for all workloads, on-premises, in the cloud, across multiple clouds, and in hybrid environments. It provides trusted recovery of data and applications, virtual machines, and containers, along with verifiable recoverability of replicas, cost-optimized cloud data mobility, security and resilient ransomware protection, and flexible copy data management to leverage protected data for DevOps, testing, and analytics.
Data Insights
Commvault Activate is an integrated family of solutions for actionable insights, combining Commvault Data Governance, Commvault File Storage Optimization, and Commvault eDiscovery and Compliance. Activate can operate independent of Commvault Complete Data Protection or as part of a combined solution to maximize data management capabilities for any business. This means that with Activate customers can gain insights to data that isn’t managed by Commvault to drive analytics, and other tasks against those data sources.
Storage
Hyperscale
Commvault HyperScale X is an intuitive and easy-to-deploy, scale-out solution that is fully integrated with Commvault’s intelligent data management platform to help enterprises transition from legacy scale-up infrastructures. It provides scalability, security and resiliency to accelerate an organization’s digital transformation journey as they move to hybrid cloud, container and virtualized environments. Its flexible architecture allows customers to get up and running quickly and grow as needs change. HyperScale X technology accelerates hybrid cloud adoption with an integrated solution that delivers comprehensive data management for all workloads, including containers, virtual and databases, from a single, extensible platform. With HyperScale X, customers can leverage the entire Commvault software portfolio giving them access to all the features, functions, and industry leading integration with applications, databases, public cloud environments, hypervisors, operating systems, NAS systems and primary storage arrays, wherever the data resides. It is available in two form factors giving customers the flexibility to choose an implementation based on specific needs and preferences:
•Commvault HyperScale X Appliance: A fully integrated appliance that streamlines operations and infrastructure and is ideally suited for smaller deployments with capacity requirements less than 150 terabytes that want the simplicity of an all-in-one integrated appliance from a single vendor
•Commvault HyperScale X Software: Pre-validated hardware platform and configuration, provides greater flexibility and allows customer to leverage existing vendor relationships, and is ideally suited for larger environments that require greater scale

Customers
Our current customer base spans thousands of organizations across a wide variety of sizes, including large global enterprise companies, and small or mid-sized businesses and government agencies. We support customers in a broad range of industries, including banking, insurance and financial services, government, healthcare, pharmaceuticals and medical services, technology, legal, manufacturing, utilities and energy. 
Strategic Relationships
An important element of Commvault’s strategy is to establish relationships with third parties that assist us in developing, marketing, selling and implementing our software and services. We believe that strategic and technology-based relationships with industry leaders are fundamental to our success. We have forged numerous relationships with software application, hardware and cloud vendors to enhance our combined capabilities and to create the optimal combination of data and information management applications. We believe this approach enhances our ability to expand our product offerings and customer base and to enter new markets. We have established the following types of strategic relationships:
Alliance and Technology Partners.    We maintain strategic product and technology relationships with major industry leaders to ensure that our software applications are integrated with, supported by and add value to our partners’ hardware and software products. Collaboration with these market leaders allows us to provide applications that enable our customers to improve data and information management efficiency. Our significant strategic relationships include Microsoft (including Azure), Cisco, Dell EMC, Amazon Web Services (AWS), NetApp, Nutanix, Fujitsu, Google Cloud, Hitachi, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM, Lenovo, OpenStack, Oracle, Pure Storage, Red Hat, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, Splunk, Supermicro and VMware. In addition to these relationships, we maintain relationships with a broad range of industry operating system, application and infrastructure vendors to verify and demonstrate the interoperability of our software applications with their equipment and technologies.
Distributors, Value-Added Reseller, Systems Integrator, Corporate Reseller and Original Equipment Manufacturer Relationships.    Our corporate resellers bundle or sell our software applications together with their own products, and our value-added resellers resell our software applications independently. As of March 31, 2021, we had more than 500 reseller partners and systems integrators that have distributed our software worldwide.
In order to broaden our market coverage, we work closely with our global original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") partners, investing significant time and resources to deliver unique, joint solutions incorporating Commvault software. These partners team with our technical, engineering, marketing and sales force on helping to enhance integration, tuning, operational management, implementation and vision for solutions that are designed to meet current and future data and information management needs. Our alliance managers work directly with global OEM partners to design, deliver and support field activities that make it easier for customers to locate, learn about, and purchase these differentiated solutions. Our most significant OEM partner is Hitachi Vantara ("Hitachi"). Hitachi has no obligation to recommend or offer our software applications exclusively or at all, and they have no minimum sales requirements and can terminate our relationship at any time. 
Additionally, we have a non-exclusive distribution agreement covering our North American commercial markets and our U.S. Federal Government markets with Arrow Enterprise Computing Solutions, Inc. ("Arrow"), a subsidiary of Arrow Electronics, Inc. Pursuant to this distribution agreement, Arrow's primary role is to enable a more efficient and effective distribution channel for our products and services by managing our reseller partners and leveraging their own industry experience. Sales generated through our distribution agreement with Arrow accounted for 36% of our total revenue in fiscal 2021 and 37% of our total revenue in fiscal 2020.
Service Provider Partners. Our software is the data protection platform for over 200 service providers, which provide cloud-based solutions to client systems worldwide. As companies of all sizes and markets rapidly adopt cloud infrastructures for improved costs, speed and agility, we remain committed to these strategic relationships to address this growing trend.  Customers looking to move IT operations into the cloud depend on service providers to help them migrate, manage and protect their cloud infrastructures. We have partnered with a broad ecosystem of managed service provider and cloud partners so they can effectively deliver data management-as-a-service solutions based on Commvault software across geographies, vertical markets and offerings. Leading providers who have integrated Commvault software into their solution portfolios include Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, Rackspace, Meridian, Sirius and Flexential.
Competition
The data storage management market is intensely competitive, highly fragmented and characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving standards. The principal competitive factors in our industry include product functionality, product performance, product integration, platform coverage, ability to scale, price, worldwide sales infrastructure, global technical support, name recognition and reputation. The ability of major system vendors to bundle hardware and software solutions is also a significant competitive factor in our industry. 
We currently compete with other providers of data and information management software as well as large and emerging storage hardware manufacturers that have developed or acquired their own data and information management software products. These manufacturers have the resources and capabilities to develop their own data and information management software applications, and many have been making acquisitions and broadening their efforts to include broader data and information management and storage products. These manufacturers and our other current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties, creating new competitors or alliances. Large operating system and application vendors have introduced products or functionality that includes some of the same functions offered by our software applications. In the future, further development by these vendors could cause some features of our software applications to become redundant.
Our primary competitors in the data and information management software applications market, each of which has one or more products that compete with a part of or our entire software suite, are Dell-EMC, IBM, Veritas, Veeam, Rubrik and Cohesity. 
Some of our competitors have greater financial resources and may have the ability to offer their products at lower prices than ours. In addition, some of our competitors have greater name recognition than us, which could provide them a competitive advantage with some customers. Some of our competitors also have longer operating histories, have substantially greater technical, sales, marketing and other global resources than we do, as well as a larger installed customer base and broader product offerings, including hardware. As a result, these competitors can devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products than we can. Refer to our "Risk Factors" below.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our data and information management software applications and related services to large global enterprises, small and medium sized businesses, and government agencies. We sell through our worldwide direct sales force and our global network of distributors, value-added resellers, systems integrators, corporate resellers and OEM partners. 
We have a variety of marketing programs designed to create brand awareness and market recognition for our product offerings and for sales lead generation. Our marketing efforts include webinars, active participation at trade shows, technical conferences and technology seminars; advertising; content development and distribution; public relations; social media; industry analyst relations; publication of technical and educational articles in industry journals; sales training; and preparation of competitive analyses. In addition, our strategic partners augment our marketing and sales campaigns through seminars, trade shows and joint public relations and advertising campaigns. Our customers and strategic partners provide references and recommendations that we often feature in external marketing activities.
Research and Development
Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development, testing and certification of our data and information management software applications. Our engineering efforts support product development across all major operating systems, databases, applications and network storage devices. A substantial amount of our development effort goes into certification, integration and support of our applications to ensure interoperability with our strategic partners’ hardware and software products. We have also made substantial investments in the automation of our product test and quality assurance laboratories. 
Technology, Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
We believe our software platform serves as a major differentiator versus our competitors’ data and information management software products. Our platform’s unique indexing, cataloging, data movement, media management and policy technologies are the source of the performance, scale, management, cost of ownership 
benefits and seamless interoperability inherent in all of our data and information management software applications. Additional options enable content search, data encryption and auditing features to support data discovery and compliance requirements. Our success and ability to compete depend on our continued development and protection of our proprietary software and other technologies, including "open source" software. We rely primarily on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, as well as contractual provisions, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. 
As of March 31, 2021, we had 883 issued patents and 399 pending patent applications in the United States, as well as 130 issued patents in foreign countries and 15 pending foreign patent applications. As disclosed, we have established proprietary trademark rights in markets across the globe, and own hundreds of U.S. and foreign trademark registrations and pending registration applications for marks comprised of or incorporating the Commvault name. Refer to our “Risk Factors” below.
People
Commvault aims to unlock potential in data, customers and our employees. To accomplish that, everyone has the green light to discover, create, nurture and sustain the energy needed to drive innovation and help our customers—by inspiring one another, by imagining what others simply don’t and by working to make what’s already great, even greater—whether that’s product, process or team. As of March 31, 2021, we had 2,671 employees worldwide, including 1,003 in sales and marketing, 724 in research and development, 621 in customer services and support and 323 in general and administration. Approximately 48% were in the United States and 52% were located internationally.
Inclusion and Diversity
At Commvault, we believe that diversity is more than a program – it is a business imperative at the heart of our human capital management strategy. In partnership with our leadership team, we not only drive the ability to be a best-in-class data management organization but uphold our value in the marketplace by leading as an employer of choice. Our commitment is driven and executed by a three-pronged approach to Inclusion and Diversity ("I&D"): Workplace Inclusion, Workforce Diversity and Personal Accountability. 
To fortify our strategy, we continue to elevate our employee engagement efforts – which is the foundation of our approach. We have implemented an Employee Resource Group (“ERG”) operating model and have established four ERGs to provide opportunity for cross-cultural learning, mentoring and relationship building across employees: 
1.CV WIT (Women in Technology), 
2.Multi-Culture, 
3.LGBTQ+ & Allies, and 
4.VALOR (Veterans) 
In addition to our continued employee engagement initiatives, in 2020 we launched the Courageous Conversations platform. Courageous Conversations was designed as a forum where difficult conversations can be broached in an open, safe and respectful manner. This platform has become the hub for all I&D related conversations, where employees and senior leaders share courageous life experiences related to bias and social injustice. Since its inception, we have hosted seven powerful sessions, each virtually, reaching our workforce population around the globe.
We continue to be committed to our focus to secure the very best talent, with a concerted effort to expound on and build a truly inclusive and diverse pipeline of candidates. We are committed to providing a clear line of sight to career progression while investing in the development, creativity and aspirational needs of all employees.
COVID-19 Response
Commvault values its people. In navigating this unprecedented time, we are focused on driving business globally while honoring and caring for the health and safety of our employees, customers, and partners. During 2020, and continuing into 2021, the vast majority of our employees worked remotely, delivering successful and proactive results. We continue to monitor the spread of COVID-19 and are adhering to guidelines set forth by the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control as we look to reopen offices. We continue to provide employees with routine updates, resources and support to ensure everyone’s health, safety and well-being.
