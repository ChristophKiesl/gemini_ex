--------+---------

Overview 
 We are a biotechnology company focused primarily on the development of new products for inflammation, inborn errors of metabolism, and other diseases that are thought to be related to endogenously generated toxic and pro-inflammatory chemical species known as aldehydes. We are developing ADX-102 (formerly known as NS2), as well as other novel product candidates, including ADX-103 and ADX-104, that are designed specifically to sequester aldehydes for the treatment of: 

 | Noninfectious Anterior Uveitis, a rare but severe inflammatory eye disease that can lead to blindness;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Allergic Conjunctivitis, a common disease that affects more than 20% of the population worldwide, and related rare allergic ocular diseases that are characterized by inflammation of the conjunctiva (a membrane covering part of the front of the eye), resulting in ocular itching, excessive tear production, swelling, and redness;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Dry Eye Syndrome, a common inflammatory disease characterized by insufficient moisture and lubrication associated with the anterior surface of the eye, leading to ocular irritation, burning, stinging, and, in severe cases, loss of vision;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Sjögren-Larsson Syndrome (SLS), a rare inborn error of metabolism caused by mutations in an enzyme that metabolizes fatty aldehydes, resulting in severe skin and neurological disorders; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Succinic Semi-Aldehyde Dehydrogenase Deficiency (SSADH), a rare inborn error of metabolism caused by genetic mutations in an aldehyde-metabolizing enzyme, leading to severe neurological disease.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In February 2016, we announced that the results of a randomized, parallel-group, double-masked, vehicle-controlled Phase 2a clinical trial of ADX-102 ophthalmic solution in patients with allergic conjunctivitis demonstrated statistically and clinically significant activity of ADX-102 over vehicle in reducing ocular itching and tearing. In May 2016, we announced that the results of our randomized, parallel-group, investigator-masked, active-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of ADX-102 ophthalmic solution in patients with noninfectious anterior uveitis demonstrated that ADX-102 reduced inflammatory cell count in the anterior chamber of the eye to a degree similar to that of standard-of-care corticosteroid therapy (which may lead to cataracts and glaucoma in some patients), but without the intraocular pressure elevations that were observed in subjects treated with corticosteroids. In August 2016, we announced that the results of a randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trial of a dermatologic formulation of ADX-102 for the treatment of the skin manifestations of SLS demonstrated clinically relevant activity of ADX-102 in diminishing the severity of ichthyosis, a serious dermatologic disease characteristic of SLS. In all clinical trials to date, ADX-102 was well tolerated, and no serious adverse events have been reported.

In February 2017, we announced the enrollment of the first patient in a Phase 2b clinical trial of topical ocular ADX-102 for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. We expect to begin a planned Phase 3 clinical trial of topical ocular ADX-102 for the treatment of noninfectious anterior uveitis in the second quarter of 2017. We expect to begin a planned Phase 3 clinical trial of topical dermatologic ADX-102 for the treatment of the skin manifestations of SLS in the second half of 2017. We expect to begin a planned Phase 2a clinical trial of topical ocular ADX-102 for the treatment of Dry Eye Syndrome in the second quarter of 2017. Contingent on preclinical results, regulatory feedback, and other factors, we may also initiate a planned Phase 2a clinical trial of ADX-103 in Dry Eye Syndrome. We expect to begin a planned Phase 1 clinical trial of systemically administered ADX-102 or ADX-104 in the first half of 2018. We expect to begin systemically administered Phase 2a clinical trials in SLS and SSADH in the second half of 2018. All of our development timelines may be subject to adjustment depending on recruitment rate, regulatory review, preclinical and clinical results, and other factors that could delay the initiation or completion of clinical trials. Our clinical development pipeline is summarized in the figure below. 
 Clinical Development Pipeline 
 

Since our incorporation, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. Our ability to generate revenues largely depends upon our ability, alone or with others, to complete the development of our product candidates to obtain the regulatory approvals for and to manufacture, market and sell our products and product candidates. The results of our operations will vary significantly from year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter and depend on a number of factors, including risks related to our business and industry, risks relating to intellectual property and other legal matters, risks related to our common stock, and other risks that are detailed in the section of this annual report on Form 10-K entitled Risk Factors. 
Business Strategy 
 We intend to develop ADX-102 and other novel aldehyde traps for the diseases described above as well as potentially other diseases where aldehydes may mediate pathology. We believe that aldehyde trapping is a novel approach with broad therapeutic potential in inflammatory diseases and inborn errors of aldehyde metabolism. Accordingly, we have patented and will continue to attempt to patent novel drug compositions, formulations, and methods that relate to aldehyde trapping. While we may continue to develop and eventually attempt to market aldehyde traps for certain diseases following regulatory approval, if any, we may also partner with larger companies to develop and commercialize products for other diseases where aldehyde toxicity is implicated, particularly diseases that afflict large populations worldwide. 
 
6 
 
Specifically, our business strategy is to: 
 

 | Continue the development of and pursue regulatory approval for ADX-102 and other aldehyde traps. We have initiated clinical trials of ADX-102 in several diseases, and we may initiate clinical trials of ADX-103, ADX-104, and other aldehyde traps. If sufficient safety and efficacy is demonstrated over multiple clinical trials as part of the standard drug development process, we intend to apply to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and comparable foreign agencies for marketing approval of our product candidates.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Aggressively develop new intellectual property and consider partnerships to accelerate development and maximize commercial potential. We have discovered and synthesized a variety of aldehyde traps that we intend to develop and patent for new indications. For some indications, especially those that afflict large populations worldwide, we will consider development and commercialization licensing opportunities with strategic partners that have significant financial resources, commercialization experience, and global infrastructure.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Explore building in-house capabilities to commercialize ADX-102, ADX-103, and ADX-104 in the United States and other geographies. As, and if, ADX-102 and our other product candidates progress through clinical programs, in addition to partnering opportunities that we may consider, we also intend to evaluate the development of our own specialty sales force and marketing capabilities to allow us to directly market our product candidates in the United States or in other geographies, if approved by FDA or analogous regulatory agencies outside the United States.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Consider in-licensing complementary drug programs. We may consider in-licensing additional product candidates or technology rights that are unrelated to aldehyde trapping but complementary to our current development programs.

The Markets for Our Product Candidates 
 Occurring generally as a result of a large number of metabolic processes, aldehydes are an endogenously generated chemical species that, among other things, promote inflammation. At high levels, aldehydes are toxic and are implicated as mediators of many inflammatory diseases. Other diseases thought to be related to aldehydes include inborn errors of metabolism, where genetic mutations lead to the incapacity to metabolize certain toxic aldehydes. We believe that the medical needs of the patients suffering from aldehyde-mediated diseases are not currently well addressed and that there is a large market potential for therapies that can lower aldehyde levels. In particular, current therapies for inflammatory diseases are often inadequate and may lead to toxicity, and there are no FDA-approved therapies specifically indicated for inborn errors of aldehyde metabolism. 
Allergic Conjunctivitis 
 Allergic conjunctivitis is a common allergic disease that is thought to be mediated in part by pro-inflammatory aldehydes, and is characterized by inflammation of the conjunctiva, resulting in excessive ocular itching and tear production in addition to ocular swelling and redness. Allergic conjunctivitis has been estimated to affect more than 20% of the population worldwide. The mainstay of therapy for allergic conjunctivitis is anti-histamines, which may lead to mydriasis (large pupils) and, in some patients, blurry vision. Further, approximately one million patients in the United States do not respond to anti-histamines, especially after the acute effects of the medication subside. Many anti-histamine refractory patients are treated with corticosteroids, which often lead to a variety of ocular toxicities that include glaucoma (a potentially blinding disease characterized by elevated intraocular pressure), cataracts (lens opacities that can lead to loss of vision), ocular infection, and ulceration. Other ocular diseases related to allergic conjunctivitis include atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC), a rare condition characterized by persistent allergic inflammation of the front of the eye. Treatment of AKC generally requires chronic corticosteroid administration, and physicians treating AKC patients must continuously balance the severity of the disease with the toxicity of corticosteroids. 
 
7 
 
By trapping pro-inflammatory aldehydes, we believe ADX-102 may reduce inflammation in allergic conjunctivitis, AKC, and related diseases. ADX-102 may also reduce the burden of corticosteroid use in patients with persistent disease or in patients that do not respond adequately to anti-histamines. Given the toxicity of corticosteroids, we believe that there is a high demand for a novel topical anti-inflammatory agent to be used in conjunction with lower doses of, or in place of, corticosteroids. 
 Noninfectious Anterior Uveitis 
 Noninfectious anterior uveitis is an inflammatory ocular disease that is associated with elevated aldehyde levels and is characterized by severe pain, sensitivity to light, and loss of vision that can progress to blindness. The disease may occur with other autoimmune diseases. The annual incidence of noninfectious anterior uveitis in the United States is estimated to be 150,000 patients, and approximately one-third of these patients have one or more episodes per year. The disease is typically treated with topical corticosteroids, and many patients are at risk of developing glaucoma and cataracts as a result of corticosteroid treatment. Corticosteroids may also increase the incidence of infection and corneal ulceration. 
 By trapping pro-inflammatory aldehydes, we believe ADX-102 may diminish inflammation in noninfectious anterior uveitis and reduce the burden of corticosteroid use. Given the toxicity of corticosteroids, we believe that there is a high demand for a novel topical anti-inflammatory agent to be used in conjunction with lower doses of, or in place of, corticosteroids. 
 Dry Eye Syndrome 
 Dry Eye Syndrome is a common inflammatory disease that is estimated to affect five to ten percent of the population in the United States, and is characterized by insufficient moisture and lubrication of the anterior surface of the eye. Symptoms may include ocular irritation, burning, or stinging, and severe cases may lead to loss of vision. In patients with Dry Eye Syndrome, elevated ocular levels of pro-inflammatory aldehydes are correlated with disease severity and likely contribute to persistent inflammation. Since aldehydes covalently bind to lipids (fats) found in tears, the increased aldehyde load in Dry Eye Syndrome patients may also exacerbate insufficient ocular surface lubrication. 
 Until 2016, only one drug had been approved by the FDA for the treatment of Dry Eye Syndrome, and therapy for the disease is generally considered by patients and physicians to be inadequate. Patients with severe cases of Dry Eye Syndrome may require corticosteroids. Since lowering aldehyde levels may diminish ocular inflammation and preserve tear lubricating capacity in patients with Dry Eye Syndrome, ADX-102 and ADX-103 represent a potential novel, dual-acting therapeutic approach that could be used to augment the efficacy of currently available medications and, in severe cases, reduce or eliminate the need for corticosteroid therapy. 
 Sjögren-Larsson Syndrome 
 SLS is caused by genetic mutations of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), an enzyme that converts long-chain aldehydes to fatty acids. FALDH dysfunction leads to fatty aldehyde accumulation, which is thought to result in a severe skin disorder called ichthyosis, which is characterized by thick, scaly, flaking, itchy and inflamed skin involving much of the body surface area, as well as mental delay, spasticity, and, in some patients, retinal disorders. SLS patients are generally diagnosed as neonates given the severe ichthyosis that presents at birth. The disease persists lifelong, and SLS patients have a shortened lifespan, often dying in the sixth decade of life. Some SLS patients are believed to inherit the disease, though most occurrences of SLS appear to be due to sporadic mutations. The disease occurs worldwide. To our knowledge, Sweden is currently the only country to have estimated the prevalence of the disease, at 1 per 250,000 people. Extrapolating from the Swedish estimate, it is generally assumed that there are approximately 1,000 or fewer SLS patients in the United States and a larger number in Europe. The United States SLS prevalence estimate is supported by frequency analysis of FALDH missense mutations in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute exome sequencing database. We believe that 
 
8 
 
 many older SLS patients may be undiagnosed, potentially due to the lack of available dermatologic and genetic medicine expertise available when those patients were younger. There is no FDA-approved treatment specifically indicated for SLS. 
 The primary day-to-day complaint of SLS patients and their caregivers is ichthyosis, a severe skin disease characterized in SLS patients by thick, scaly, dry, flaking, wrinkled, pigmented, pruritic (itchy), inflamed skin. SLS patients are consistently disturbed by pruritus and often excoriate skin by scratching. The scales that accumulate on the surface of the skin are subject to bacterial overgrowth, which results in an unpleasant odor that is associated with some SLS patients. The ichthyosis in SLS affects most of the body, generally sparing only the face, palms, and soles, and considerable social stigma and emotional burden is common, especially given scale odor, the flaking skin, and the misconception that patients suffer from diffuse cutaneous infectious disease. There is currently no specific therapy approved for the treatment of the dermatologic disease in SLS, though some patients and their caregivers apply non-specific topical creams, including keratinolytics (acids that soften skin), moisturizers, and retinoids. We believe that the effects of keratinolytic and moisturizing creams are minimal or non-existent in treating severe ichthyosis, and due to toxicity, retinoids are not suitable for chronic use. 
 The dermatologic disease in SLS is thought to be caused by aldehyde-mediated modification of lipids (fats) that are generated in the epidermis (the most superficial layer of skin) to form a moisture barrier that holds water in the skin. Moisture barrier compromise leads to water loss, which in turn leads to epidermal thickening characteristic of ichthyosis. We believe that by lowering levels of aldehydes and thereby preventing lipid modification and the ensuing moisture barrier dysfunction, ADX-102, when applied topically to the skin, has the potential to ameliorate the dermatologic symptoms of SLS. Further, by reducing aldehyde load throughout the body, we believe the systemic administration of ADX-102, ADX-104, or other aldehyde traps may be beneficial in the treatment of the neurological and ocular symptoms of SLS. 
 Succinic Semi-Aldehyde Dehydrogenase Deficiency 
 SSADH Deficiency is a neurological disease caused by mutations in succinic semi-aldehyde dehydrogenase that result in elevated levels of succinic semi-aldehyde, a toxic aldehyde that is converted into gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and other metabolites that lead to severe neurological dysfunction, including cognitive delay, seizures, and motor disease. Over 400 patients with SSADH Deficiency have been identified worldwide, though the precise prevalence of the disease is not known. GHB (also known as sodium oxybate, a drug marketed for psychiatric disorders) and possibly other succinic semi-aldehyde metabolites lead to depression of neurological function, and some patients with a diagnosis of autism have been found to have SSADH Deficiency. 
 There is currently no FDA-approved therapy specifically indicated for SSADH Deficiency, and most patients are treated supportively with anti-epileptic medications. While several therapeutic approaches have been attempted in clinical trials, and one medication is currently undergoing testing in a clinical trial run by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, to our knowledge, none have shown promise in addressing the core toxicity of succinic semi-aldehyde, and patients are generally poorly responsive to these approaches. By trapping succinic semi-aldehyde, ADX-102, ADX-104, or other systemically administered aldehyde traps may have the potential to reduce the direct toxicity of succinic semi-aldehyde as well as the formation of neurotoxic metabolites, and represent a novel approach with considerable therapeutic potential in a disease where there remains significant unmet medical need. 
 A New Therapeutic Approach for Inflammation and Inborn Errors of Aldehyde Metabolism: ADX-102, ADX-103, ADX-104, and Other Novel Aldehyde Traps 
 Aldehyde Toxicity and Sequestration 
 Aldehydes are generated through a variety of metabolic processes. At high levels, aldehydes are toxic, binding proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and DNA, and may mediate inflammation in, and the progression of, many 
 
9 
 
 serious diseases through signaling cascades that lead to the activation of intracellular inflammatory factors, including NF-kB, an important protein in the inflammatory response. In addition, aldehyde binding to cellular constituents leads to the formation of adducts and aggregates that may lead to cellular dysfunction. Because of the inherent toxicity of aldehydes, most, if not all, living organisms contain enzymes such as aldehyde dehydrogenases that detoxify aldehydes. The toxicity of aldehydes is evidenced by human studies showing an increased rate of cognitive decline, cancer, and cardiovascular disease in populations with diminished aldehyde dehydrogenase capacity. Additionally, most inflammatory diseases, including autoimmune disease, neurodegenerative disease, and cardiovascular diseases, manifest elevated aldehyde levels that apparently overwhelm endogenous aldehyde catabolic capacity. To our knowledge, there has never been a concerted pharmaceutical effort to lower all free aldehyde levels. Thus, we believe that aldehyde sequestration represents a novel platform for the treatment of inflammatory conditions and inborn errors of aldehyde metabolism where genetic mutations prevent the normal degradation of aldehydes. 
 Aside from increasing levels of inflammation, there is no generally accepted biological role of high levels of aldehydes. Some physiologic molecules have aldehyde forms, including retinaldehyde (a form of Vitamin A) and pyridoxal and pyridoxal phosphate (forms of Vitamin B6), but these molecules are not free aldehydes in that they are tightly chaperoned and protected by proteins that prevent the aldehydes from reacting with other molecules, including aldehyde traps. Thus, pharmacotherapeutic aldehyde sequestration is expected a priori not to adversely affect normal physiologic processes. Consistent with the toxicity of free aldehydes and the lack of accessibility to chaperoned physiologic aldehydes, our most advanced aldehyde trap, ADX-102, which has been administered to over 100 subjects across four clinical trials, has been generally well tolerated and has not resulted in any serious adverse events. 
 Aldehyde Traps 
 We are currently developing ADX-102, a new chemical entity, for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and inborn errors of aldehyde metabolism. ADX-102 is a small molecule designed specifically to trap, and thereby allow for the degradation of, aldehydes. In in vitro and animal studies, ADX-102 appears to have minimal pharmacology, meaning that ADX-102 does not appear to affect most cellular components, including most receptors, enzymes, ion channels, or other proteins. ADX-102 has been shown to bind and trap aldehydes more rapidly than aldehydes bind any cellular constituent. Evidence suggests that ADX-102 covalently binds to aldehydes to form ADX-102-aldehyde adducts, which appear to be rapidly degraded in cellular environments, after which neither ADX-102 or free aldehydes are detectable. Outside of biological systems, ADX-102-aldehyde adducts are remarkably non-reactive and stable, suggesting that ADX-102-aldehyde binding is effectively irreversible; hence the notion of ADX-102 as an aldehyde trap. By essentially irreversibly binding aldehydes to form covalent adducts that are then degraded, ADX-102 and other aldehyde traps have the potential to substantially lower aldehyde levels. 
 We believe we have been the first to demonstrate the positive effects of lowering aldehyde levels with an aldehyde trap in a variety of animal models relating to inflammation, suggesting that aldehyde traps may have potent anti-inflammatory effects that persist hours after ADX-102 administration at a variety of different doses relevant to clinical testing. In addition, we believe we have also been the first to demonstrate the activity of ADX-102 in binding aldehydes in in vitro and preclinical models of inborn errors of aldehyde metabolism. 
 

 | In mouse models of ocular inflammation and post-surgical healing, topically applied ADX-102 ophthalmic solution reduced ocular redness and inflammatory cytokines comparable to corticosteroid therapy and slowed the development of corneal haze (fibrosis).

 | In mice injected with a pro-inflammatory agent known as endotoxin, intraperitoneally administered ADX-102 statistically reduced a variety of inflammatory cytokines (protein inflammatory mediators), including IL-5, Il-1ß, IL-17, and TNF-a, while up-regulating the primary anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. Additionally, in models of mouse contact dermatitis (induced by phorbol myristate acetate) and

allergic contact dermatitis (induced by sensitivity to oxazolone), ADX-102 statistically reduced inflammation as measured by edema (swelling). (Data presented at the American Academy of Asthma Allergy and Immunology 2015 Annual Meeting)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | In a model of radiation mucositis (oral inflammation) in hamsters, chronic subcutaneous administration of ADX-102 reduced healing time and decreased fibrosis (scarring).

 | In cells lacking FALDH (a model of SLS), ADX-102 prevented aldehydes from binding a lipid (fat) thought to be critical to the dermal moisture barrier. (Data presented at the Society for Inherited Metabolic Disorders 2015 Annual Meeting)

 | In a knock-out mouse model of SSADH Deficiency, ADX-102 trapped succinic semi-aldehyde in key tissues following intraperitoneal injection. (Data presented at the 2016 SSADH Symposium and at the 2015 American Society of Human Genetics Annual Meeting)

 | In two different mouse models of inflammatory pain, intraperitoneally administered ADX-102 dose-dependently reduced nociceptive behavior, suggesting that ADX-102 down-regulates pain signaling in inflammation. (Data presented at the 2016 International Conference on Pain Research and Management)

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Thus, we believe that aldehyde trapping with ADX-102 potentially has a variety of mechanisms of action  lowering inflammation, reducing healing time, diminishing scarring, protecting a lipid important in tissue moisture barriers, and mitigating pain  that may ameliorate aldehyde-mediated disease and deter aldehyde-mediated disease progression in different ways at the same time. 
 In addition to the development of ADX-102, we intend to continue the discovery and development of other novel aldehyde traps and we intend to continue to develop intellectual property around such molecules. We have identified, synthesized, and tested numerous molecules that may be more potent than ADX-102 in trapping aldehydes. We are currently screening novel traps for product candidates to address diseases where topical and systemic administration are applicable to reduce aldehyde-mediated pathology. We have nominated two new aldehyde traps, ADX-103 and ADX-104, for clinical development, which may begin 2018, depending on additional preclinical data, regulatory discussions, funding, and other factors. 
 Clinical Development 
 In order to assess the efficacy of aldehyde trapping in human disease, in 2015 we initiated a series of clinical trials in patients with ocular inflammatory disease and in patients with SLS, an inborn error of aldehyde metabolism. Our initial clinical trials in inflammation involved ocular testing, in part, due to the ability to non-invasively assess inflammation on the surface of and within the eye and the ability to treat the eye with topical administration of drug. Our initial clinical trial in inborn errors of aldehyde metabolism focused on SLS, in part, because the dermatologic aspects of the disease may respond to topical administration of drug, and assessment of dermatological response can be performed with relatively non-invasive techniques and clinical examination. Most inflammatory diseases and inborn errors of aldehyde metabolism, involve at least some tissues that cannot be effectively treated topically, and thus we are developing systemic formulations of aldehyde traps, including ADX-102 and ADX-104. We plan to initiate Phase 1 clinical testing of a systemic formulation in the first half of 2018.

Allergic Conjunctivitis 
 In September 2015, we initiated a randomized, parallel-group, double-masked, vehicle-controlled Phase 2a clinical trial of 0.5% ADX-102 ophthalmic solution in patients with allergic conjunctivitis. Using the conjunctival allergen provocation test (CAPT), one hundred healthy men and women with at least a two-year history of allergic conjunctivitis to grass, tree, or ragweed pollen were randomized in equal groups for treatment with topical ocular ADX-102 or vehicle, and ocular inflammation was induced by exposure to allergen. The clinical endpoints in the trial included patient assessment (on a 0 to 3 point scale) of ocular itching and tearing, two prominent inflammation-related symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. In February 2016, we announced that the results demonstrated statistically significant activity of ADX-102 over vehicle in reducing ocular itching and tearing after a single dose (see figure below). Relative to baseline scores, ADX-102 demonstrated durable efficacy that persisted across substantially all time points over three hours following CAPT challenges. Despite a stronger than expected vehicle effect, peak changes in ocular itching and tearing scores were statistically superior to vehicle. The reductions from baseline scores were of the same magnitude previously observed in the CAPT model with existing therapies utilized in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. ADX-102 was generally well tolerated and there were no safety concerns during the trial. Transient and generally mild stinging was noted in the treatment arm. Two patients dropped out of the trial during treatment. 
Allergic Conjunctivitis Phase 2a Clinical Trial Results for Ocular Itching and Tearing Following a Single Dose of ADX-102 vs. Vehicle 
 

To our knowledge, the data from the allergic conjunctivitis Phase 2a clinical trial represent the first demonstration of the efficacy of aldehyde trapping in any human disease, and we believe that the results validate the potential of aldehyde traps as a novel anti-inflammatory therapy. 
 In February 2017, we announced the enrollment of the first patient in a Phase 2b allergic conjunctivitis clinical trial of topical ocular ADX-102. Given the unexpectedly large vehicle response observed in the Phase 2a clinical trial, we have reached agreement with the FDA that saline, instead of vehicle, will be the control in the Phase 2b clinical trial and subsequent clinical trials. The primary endpoint in Phase 2b will be difference from saline in patient-reported ocular itching following a single dose of ADX-102 in the Conjunctival Allergen Challenge (CAC) model, which has been used for the registration of other drugs for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. In addition to saline, two concentrations of ADX-102 topical ocular solution will be tested: 0.1% and 0.5%. Planned enrollment is 50 subjects in each of the three arms of the trial. Results from the trial are expected in the third quarter of 2017.

Noninfectious Anterior Uveitis 
 In April 2015, we initiated a randomized, parallel-group, double-masked, comparator-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of 0.5% ADX-102 ophthalmic solution in patients with noninfectious anterior uveitis, a rare but painful and potentially blinding ocular inflammatory disease. Forty-five subjects were randomized equally to receive six weeks of treatment with one of the following: ADX-102 0.5% four times daily; Pred Forte® 1% (a corticosteroid) four times daily (tapered); or ADX-102 0.5% four times daily and Pred Forte® 1% two times daily (tapered). In May 2016, we announced that the results of the trial demonstrated that the activity of ADX-102 was comparable to Pred Forte® in reducing anterior chamber inflammatory cell count (see figure below), which is the primary endpoint required for product registration. At the week 4 visit, grade 0 cell count (zero or one cells) was observed in 53% of ADX-102-treated patients versus 38% of corticosteroid-treated patients. Elevations of intraocular pressure observed in corticosteroid-treated patients were not observed in ADX-102-treated patients (see figure below). ADX-102 was generally well tolerated and there were no serious adverse events, consistent with previous Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials.

Noninfectious Anterior Uveitis Phase 2 Clinical Trial Results for Intraocular Pressure (mmHg) 
 

We expect to initiate, in the second quarter of 2017, a Phase 3 clinical trial of topical ocular 0.5% ADX-102 for the treatment of noninfectious anterior uveitis. We have reached agreement with the FDA that vehicle will be used as a control in the trial. The primary endpoint will be difference from control in time to cure (zero anterior chamber inflammatory cells). Up to 100 patients will be enrolled and randomized equally to receive either ADX-102 or vehicle for 4 weeks.

Dry Eye Syndrome 
 In the second quarter of 2017, we expect to initiate enrollment of a Phase 2a clinical trial in Dry Eye Syndrome, a common ocular inflammatory disease characterized by pain, burning, and stinging. Approximately 45 patients will be equally randomized to 28 days of treatment with topical drops containing 0.1% ADX-102; 0.5% ADX-102 or 0.5% ADX-102 in a novel, lipid-based formulation. Endpoints will include assessment of tear quality (osmolarity and tear film breakup time), corneal integrity, and symptoms. Results from the trial are expected in the fourth quarter of 2017. Contingent on preclinical results, regulatory feedback, and other factors, we may also initiate a Phase 2a clinical trial of ADX-103 for the treatment of Dry Eye Syndrome. 
 Sjögren-Larsson Syndrome 
 In March 2015, we initiated a randomized, parallel-group, double-blinded, vehicle-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of a dermatologic formulation of ADX-102 for the treatment of the skin manifestations of SLS. Twelve subjects with SLS and moderate to severe ichthyosis were randomized equally to receive ADX-102 1% dermatologic formulation or vehicle formulation administered once daily on a 4 x 10 inch area of skin for two months. Investigators and subjects were blinded to treatment group. Ichthyosis was graded by a blinded central review of digital photographs, as well as by clinical exam, using the Ichthyosis Severity Score, which is comprised of assessments of global impression, scaling, erythema (redness), lichenification (thickness) and excoriation (abrasion). 
 In August 2016, we reported that ADX-102 consistently produced clinically meaningful effects in reducing the severity of ichthyosis. As assessed by central review, five of six subjects (83%) treated with ADX-102 achieved a rating of almost clear or mild on global assessment. Six of six (100%) subjects treated with ADX-102 improved over the course of therapy as assessed by central review (p < 0.05, see figure below), and the improvement was greater than that observed with vehicle-treated patients (p < 0.05). For ADX-102-treated subjects, mean reductions in ichthyosis severity were greater after 8 weeks of therapy than after 4 weeks of therapy, suggesting a disease modifying effect of ADX-102. ADX-102 was observed to be generally well tolerated, and there were no significant adverse events, serious adverse events or discontinuations in the trial.

In the second half of 2017, we expect to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial of topical dermatologic ADX-102 for the treatment of the skin manifestations of SLS. Up to 30 patients will be treated with a 1% dermatologic formulation of ADX-102 for at least four months. The endpoint of the clinical trial is the severity of ichthyosis following treatment. 
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights 
 Overview 
 We are building an intellectual property portfolio for ADX-102 and other aldehyde traps in the United States and abroad. We currently seek, and intend to continue to seek, patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates, methods of use, and processes for manufacture, and for other technologies, where appropriate. Our current policy is to actively seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other things, filing patent applications in the United States and abroad relating to proprietary technologies that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on, and will continue to rely on, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. 
 Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for the technologies that we consider important to our business, our ability to defend our patents, and our ability to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. 
 Patent Portfolio 
 Our patent portfolio currently includes patents and patent applications covering the composition, formulation, and uses of ADX-102, ADX-103, ADX-104, and other novel aldehyde trapping compounds. As of December 31, 2016, we owned five United States patents and five pending United States non-provisional patent applications, as well as numerous foreign counterparts to these patents and patent applications. We expect the issued ADX-102 composition of matter patent in the United States, if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, to expire in 2028. It is possible that the term of the composition of matter patent in the United States may be extended up to five additional years under the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act. We expect the foreign ADX-102 composition of matter patents, if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, to expire in 2026. We expect other patent applications in the portfolio, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, to expire from 2026 to 2034. ADX-102 composition of matter patents have been issued in Australia, Canada, China, Europe (validated in approximately 14 member countries), Hong Kong, India, Japan, Mexico, Russia and South Korea. ADX-102 composition of matter patent claims are pending in Brazil. 
Other Intellectual Property Rights 
 Our marks ALDEYRA THERAPEUTICS and our logo are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. 
 Confidential Information and Inventions Assignment Agreements 
 We currently require and will continue to require each of our employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of such individuals employment, consulting or collaborative relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of 
 
15 
 
 the relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions resulting from such individuals work performed for us, utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed by the individual during employment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by applicable law. Our consulting agreements also provide for assignment to us of any intellectual property resulting from services performed by a consultant for us. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 We are currently seeking and will continue to seek to develop and commercialize ADX-102 or our other product candidates for certain diseases in the United States alone or with corporate partners. If approved by regulatory agencies for marketing, our current expectation is that ADX-102 or our other product candidates would initially be sold by us to small groups of physicians that specialize in rare disorders or severe disease. We may also plan to utilize strategic partners or contract sales forces to assist in the commercialization of ADX-102 or our other product candidates for common diseases, and with such partners, would seek to build awareness in the approved patient populations of the clinical utility of ADX-102 and our other product candidates. 
Manufacturing 
 We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of ADX-102 or our other product candidates, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently depend on third-party contract manufacturers for all of our required raw materials, drug substance and finished drug product for our preclinical research and clinical trials. We have no immediate plans to purchase, erect or otherwise create any manufacturing facilities to be owned by us for any of these purposes, and intend to continue to depend on third-party contract manufacturers for the foreseeable future. We do not have any current contractual relationships for the manufacture of commercial supplies of ADX-102 or our other product candidates. If ADX-102 or our other product candidates are approved by any regulatory agency, we intend to enter into agreements with third-party contract manufacturers for the commercial production at such time. We may utilize third-party consultants to manage our manufacturing contractors. We believe that the active pharmaceutical ingredient and other materials needed for the formulation of ADX-102, ADX-103, and ADX-104 are relatively easy to manufacture, and that multiple suppliers and formulators could be employed for this purpose. Further, the raw materials needed for manufacture of ADX-102, ADX-103 and ADX-104, as well as other components of our formulations, are generally readily available from multiple sources. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had eleven full time employees and had engaged a number of consultants. We intend to increase our employee base in connection with the continuing clinical development of ADX-102, ADX-103, ADX-104, and other product candidates. We expect that a number of consultants previously engaged in development of our product candidates will participate in ongoing clinical and manufacturing activities. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be very good. 
Competition 
 Aldehyde Modulation 
 Various academic groups have published on the idea of reducing aldehyde levels, primarily by using compounds with primary amines (certain nitrogen-containing compounds) that react with aldehydes through a well-known chemical process known as the Schiff base reaction. The Schiff base reaction is reversible, and generally the substrates (precursors) and products of the reaction exist in equilibrium such that at any point in time, the aldehyde substrate may be bound or unbound. In this way, Schiff base reactions alone represent reversible and 
 
16 
 
 temporary aldehyde binding. Various aldehyde-binding amines have been described, particularly carnosine (a naturally occurring dipeptide), which has a variety of additional potential mechanisms of action unrelated to aldehydes. At least one group has published on the use of certain nitrogen-containing marketed products to temporarily, in a reversible manner, bind retinaldehyde as a potential therapy for retinal disease. We believe that ADX-102 and other novel aldehyde traps that we have discovered are differentiated from the above approaches in that the chemical structures are novel and the reaction with aldehydes is essentially irreversible in vivo, which we believe may result in a more effective means of diminishing aldehyde levels. 
 Other Pharmacotherapies 
 The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions. We believe that the key competitive factors that will affect the development and lead to the commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety, tolerability, and the ability to reduce the dependence on, or the dose of, more toxic products. 
 Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for products and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors products may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any product that we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new products enter the market and advanced technologies become available. In addition, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our products non-competitive or obsolete. 
 We expect that, if approved, ADX-102 and or our other product candidates, will compete with a variety of generic and proprietary pharmaceuticals, depending on the approved indication. Table 1 below summarizes competitive products by indication. 
 Table 1. Competitive Pharmaceuticals by Indication 
 

Indication | Competitive Products 
Allergic Conjunctivitis | Topical antihistamines and corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), mast cell stabilizers
Noninfectious Anterior Uveitis | Topical corticosteroids 
Dry Eye Syndrome | Topical immunomodulators (cyclosporine, lifitegrast), topical corticosteroids, artificial tear solutions 
Sjögren-Larsson Syndrome | Retinoids, keratinolytics, and moisturizers 
Succinic Semi-Aldehyde Dehydrogenase Deficiency | Anti-epileptics 

 We believe that there is significant unmet medical need for the diseases that we intend to study. If ADX-102 or our other product candidates are proven to be safe and effective, we believe that ADX-102 and or our other product candidates could be used in place of or in addition to current therapies, especially in instances where current therapies are toxic and reducing exposure to such therapies would be desirable. Topical corticosteroids for ocular inflammatory diseases are often associated with toxicity, including glaucoma, cataracts, ocular 
 
17 
 
 infection, and ulceration. There is no approved therapy for SLS. We believe that the current non-specific creams and medications for SLS are poorly effective, if effective at all. There is no approved therapy for SSADH Deficiency. We believe that anti-epileptics and other medications used in SSADH Deficiency are inadequate in controlling the symptoms of the disease. While ADX-102 and other novel aldehyde traps may manifest efficacy and safety advantages over currently available therapies, many such therapies are generic or may be priced considerably lower than the pricing we anticipate for our product candidates. Pricing factors may discourage the initial or prolonged use of ADX-102 or our other product candidates. 
 Many drugs are in development for allergic conjunctivitis and Dry Eye Syndrome. Novartis/Alcon (ESBA105, LME636) and EyeGate Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (EGP-437) have conducted or are conducting clinical trials in anterior uveitis. For the diseases we intend to study, there may be other developmental therapies of which we are not aware. We believe that there are no drugs in development specifically for SLS. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke is conducting a clinical trial of a GABA receptor antagonist (SGS-742) for SSADH Deficiency. 
 A myriad of new treatments have been or are being developed to treat inflammatory diseases, and in theory could be used for the treatment of the diseases our products are intended to target. Immune-modulating products include cytokine inhibitors, immune cell receptor inhibitors, and Janus kinase inhibitors. Companies that currently market such therapies include Abbvie, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, UCB Inc. and UCB S.A., Amgen, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., and Pfizer, Inc. As these products become used more commonly, they may begin to be used in the diseases that we intend to target, and such products may manifest efficacy and safety advantages over ADX-102 or our other product candidates. 
 Government Regulation 
 FDA Approval Process 
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDAs refusal to approve pending applications, a clinical hold, warning letters, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production, withdrawal of the product from the market, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. 
 FDA approval is required before any new drug, such as a new chemical entity, or a new dosage form, new use or new route of administration of a previously approved product, can be marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a new drug product may be marketed in the United States generally involves: 
 

 | completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing and formulation studies in compliance with the FDAs good laboratory practice (GLP) regulation;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) at each site where a clinical trial will be performed before the trial may be initiated at that site;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices (GCP) to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product candidate for each intended use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured to assess compliance with the FDAs cGMP regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
18 
 

 | submission to the FDA of a new drug application (NDA) which must be accepted for filing by the FDA;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | payment of user fees, if applicable; and
--+-----------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, manufacturing and control procedures and stability, as well as animal studies to assess the toxicity and other safety characteristics of the product. The results of preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, our submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Even if the IND becomes effective and the trial proceeds without initial FDA objection, the FDA may stop the trial at a later time if it has concerns, such as if unacceptable safety risks arise. 
 Further, an independent IRB, covering each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and informed consent information for subjects before the trial commences at that site and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or for failure to comply with the IRBs requirements, or may impose other conditions. 
 If a Phase 2 clinical trial is the subject of discussion at an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, a sponsor may be able to request a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the design of the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. If such an agreement is reached, it will be documented and made part of the administrative record, and it will be binding on the FDA and may not be changed unless the sponsor fails to follow the agreed-upon protocol, data supporting the request are found to be false or incomplete, or the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the drug was identified after the testing began. Even if an SPA is agreed to, approval of the NDA is not guaranteed because a final determination that an agreed-upon protocol satisfies a specific objective, such as the demonstration of efficacy, or supports an approval decision, will be based on a complete review of all the data in the NDA. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Sponsors of clinical trials generally must register and report, at the NIH-maintained website ClinicalTrials.gov, key parameters of certain clinical trials. For purposes of an NDA submission and approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
 

 | Phase 1: The product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2: The product is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
19 
 

and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more extensive clinical trials.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 3: These are commonly referred to as pivotal studies. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the product appears to be effective and has an acceptable safety profile, trials are undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, to obtain additional evidence of clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites, to establish the overall risk-benefit relationship of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 4: In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsors agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the products safety and effectiveness after NDA approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. NDAs must also contain extensive information relating to the products pharmacology, chemistry, manufacturing and controls and proposed labeling, among other things. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition which is defined as one affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or more than 200,000 individuals where there is no reasonable expectation that the product development cost will be recovered from product sales in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA and does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If an orphan drug-designated product subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it was designed, the product will be entitled to seven years of product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. If a competitor obtains approval of the same drug, as defined by the FDA, or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitors product for the same indication or disease, the competitors exclusivity could block the approval of our product candidate in the designated orphan indication for seven years. 
 For some products, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) which could include measures imposed by the FDA such as prescribing restrictions, requirements for post-marketing studies or certain restrictions on distribution and use. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agencys threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to payment of additional user fees. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. 
 Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), the FDA agrees to specific performance goals for NDA review time through a two-tiered classification system, Standard Review and Priority Review. Standard Review NDAs have a goal of being completed within a ten-month timeframe. A Priority Review designation is given to products that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The goal for completing a Priority Review is six months. 
 
20 
 
It is likely that our product candidates will be granted a Standard Review. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain information or obtain clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. In addition, for combination products, the FDAs review may include the participation of both the FDAs Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the FDAs Center for Devices and Radiological Health, which may complicate or prolong the review. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP. 
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and, in some cases, the related manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (CRL) to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. CRLs generally outline the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDAs satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 
 Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems are identified after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval testing, including Phase 4 studies, and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products which have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Products may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, and, even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product or impose other conditions, including labeling or distribution restrictions or other risk-management mechanisms, such as a Black Box Warning, which highlights a specific warning (typically life-threatening), or a REMS program. Further, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, a company may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new or supplemental NDA, which may require such company to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to product/device listing, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. 
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 
21 
 
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things: 
 

 | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


 | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. While physicians may prescribe for off label uses, manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability, both at the federal and state levels. 
 The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 gave the FDA the authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, from manufacturers to ensure that the benefits of a drug or biological product outweigh its risks. In determining whether a REMS is necessary, FDA must consider the size of the population likely to use the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the drug, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the drug is a new molecular entity. If the FDA determines a REMS is necessary, the drug sponsor must agree to the REMS plan at the time of approval. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate health care providers of the drugs risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to assess the strategy at 18 months, three years, and seven years after the strategys approval. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on a drug already on the market if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the drugs benefits outweigh its risks. 
 Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drug candidates, some of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the products approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for extension must be made prior to expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA. 
 
22 
 
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an approved NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
 Manufacturing Requirements 
 We and our third-party manufacturers must comply with applicable FDA regulations relating to FDAs cGMP regulations and, if applicable, quality system regulation requirements for medical devices. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to, among other things, organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet cGMP requirements to the satisfaction of the FDA pursuant to a pre-approval inspection before we can use them to manufacture our products. We and our third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic unannounced inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including, among other things, warning letters, voluntary corrective action, the seizure of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties. 
Other Regulatory Requirements 
 We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have an adverse effect on our ability to operate our business and generate revenues. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development and production efforts, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. 
Research and Development Expenses 
 Substantially all of our research and development expenses incurred to date have been related to the development of ADX-102 and our other product candidates. Our research and development expenses totaled $13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
 
23 
 
We anticipate that we will incur additional research and development expenses in the future as we evaluate and possibly pursue the development of our product candidates for additional indications, or develop additional product candidates. 
 We recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of: 
 

 | salaries and related expenses for personnel;
--+---------------------------------------------


 | fees paid to consultants and contract research organizations in conjunction with independently monitoring clinical trials and acquiring and evaluating data in conjunction with clinical trials, including all related fees such as investigator grants, patient screening, lab work and data compilation and statistical analysis;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | costs incurred with third parties related to the establishment of a commercially viable manufacturing process for our product candidates;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | costs related to production of clinical materials, including fees paid to contract manufacturers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | costs related to upfront, milestone payments under in-licensing agreements as well as costs for unapproved inventory for which there is no future alternative use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | costs related to compliance with FDA regulatory requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 We expense both internal and external development costs as they are incurred. 
 We expect that a large percentage of our research and development expenses in the future will be incurred in support of our current and future non-clinical, preclinical and clinical development programs. These expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties in terms of both their timing and total cost to completion. We expect to continue to develop stable formulations of our product candidates, test such formulations in preclinical studies for toxicology, safety and efficacy and to conduct clinical trials for each product candidate. We anticipate funding clinical trials for our product candidates ourselves, but we may engage collaboration partners at certain stages of clinical development. As we obtain results from clinical trials, we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain product candidates or programs in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates or programs. Completion of clinical trials by us or our future collaborators may take several years or more, the length of time generally varying with the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product candidate. The costs of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project owing to but not limited to the following: 
 

 | the number of sites included in the trials;
--+--------------------------------------------


 | the length of time required to enroll eligible patients;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


 | the number of patients that participate in the trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


 | the number of doses that patients receive;
--+-------------------------------------------


 | the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;
--+---------------------------------------------------


 | the duration of patient follow-up;
--+-----------------------------------


 | the phase of development the product candidate is in; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------


 | the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate.

Our expenses related to clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and contract research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Generally, these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee or unit price. Payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients or the completion of clinical trial milestones. Expenses related to clinical trials generally are accrued based on contracted amounts applied to the level of patient enrollment and activity according to the protocol. If timelines or contracts are modified based upon changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed, we modify our estimates of accrued expenses accordingly on a prospective basis. 
 None of our product candidates have received FDA or foreign regulatory marketing approval. In order to grant marketing approval, a health authority such as the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies must conclude that clinical and preclinical data establish the safety and efficacy of our product candidates with an appropriate benefit to risk profile relevant to a particular indication, and that the product can be manufactured under cGMP in a reproducible manner to deliver the products intended performance in terms of its stability, quality, purity and potency. Until our submission is reviewed by a health authority, there is no way to predict the outcome of their review. Even if the clinical studies meet their predetermined primary endpoints, and a registration dossier is accepted for filing, a health authority could still determine that an appropriate benefit to risk relationship does not exist for the indication that we are seeking. 
 We cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our product candidates will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plan or capital requirements. 
 As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our development projects or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of an approved product candidate.
