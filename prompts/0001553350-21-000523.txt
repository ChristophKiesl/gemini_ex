ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
MediXall Group, Inc. (hereinafter “MediXall,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”) seeks to provide consumers with the knowledge and ability to make rapid, cost-effective healthcare purchases through its online platform, MediXall.com and Health Karma, which we refer to herein as the “MediXall Platform”. We believe that this will finally put people in control of their own healthcare and allow the full benefits of our free market system to be achieved in the healthcare industry. Our website is located at gethealthkarma.com. The information contained on our website or that can be accessed through our website neither constitutes part of this prospectus nor is incorporated by reference herein.
 
Our mission is to continually raise the bar of the healthcare experience by using data and technology to help everyone find healthcare providers, services and tools that empower them to make the best decisions along their healthcare journey.
 
MediXall.com / Health Karma is our online healthcare platform and is designed to address the growing need of self-pay and high deductible consumers for greater transparency and price competition in their healthcare costs. Launched in November 2020, the Health Karma platform is the second generation of MediXall.com, and is available through our website at www.GetHealthKarma.com and is all about seeking to make it easier for consumers to learn, decide, and pay for healthcare, without intruding on the important relationship with trusted doctors. Seeking to accomplish this, MediXall has sought to create a unified online environment that can connect physicians and service providers to patients, and payers to the physicians and service providers, across all healthcare settings.
 
Combining user experience, data, and consumer-first thinking, Medixall has sought to build a highway that makes consumers’ healthcare experience more effective and efficient. In one lane of the highway we seek to connect healthcare providers to patients and payers, and in the other lane we seek to connect healthcare providers to innovative technology solutions (one example is Telehealth). We believe that by creating this highway, Health Karma can provide users comprehensive support throughout their entire healthcare journey. Using the Health Karma platform, everyone will be able to track their deductible and out-of-pocket maximum in real-time, find experienced doctors, estimate health care costs, book in-person and telehealth appointments, and pay for appointments — all in one place.
 
With the focus on personalized cost estimates, MediXall has aimed to develop functionality to offer users the ability to integrate their existing healthcare benefits to enable the consumer to make confident financial decisions based on their insurance plan and coverage. Powered by a comprehensive database that includes over 1 million doctors in America and connected to thousands of health insurance policies nationwide, we expect that this functionality, through Health Karma which is now available. With the addition of this new functionality, MediXall has sought to create a one stop shop for helping the consumer, whether they are insured or not, understand what they need, who they need to go to, how much it will cost them and even when they need it.
 
Thus far, we have launched the MediXall.com platform marketplace throughout Florida beginning in 2019 in a controlled launch, and we have launched Health Karma throughout the U.S. in a beta release beginning in August 2020 and nationwide public launch in November 2020. The Company generated no revenue in 2020 and minimal revenue in 2019 as its online healthcare platform is still in the application and development stage.
 
We seek to generate revenues from the Health Karma Platform from fees charged to providers for the use of the technology on the Health Karma Platform. We also aim to earn revenue from subscription and services primarily from sales of subscriptions and additional features for the Health Karma Platform. Additionally, MediXall Provider Network members can choose to enter into a separate contract with MediXall technology partners to purchase additional features and functionalities, as well as other products and services.

Thus far, we have taken and also plan to take the following significant steps in our business operations. However, there can be no assurance that our planned activities can occur as planned or at all.

● | Built MediXall’s Underlying Technology to Be Highly Scalable & Flexible. We believe that MediXall’s underlying technology is a highly scalable, integrated, application program interface or API-driven technology platform. The platform has been built to accommodate the seamless and quick introduction of new services and products that we plan to introduce. These include vision, dental, behavioral health, dermatology, wellness services, medical tourism services, and other services which are currently in the development stages.

● | We Believe that we have Validated MediXall’s Ability to Attract End-Users Through Successful Controlled Launch of MediXall.com throughout the state of Florida. Through the controlled launch of MediXall.com throughout Florida beginning in 2019, we were able to successfully implement and refine our acquisition and engagement strategy to attract and convert both providers and consumers into active MediXall.com users.

● | Started bringing together a top-notch Internal Development team. With the opportunities and growth trajectory in front of the company, our goal was to build a team proficiently skilled in critical product development in a timely fashion. Speed to market is a critical factor in success. As such, we believe that we have expedited a high-quality internal development team within the MediXall organization. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Started Building a high-quality Internal Product Design and Marketing team. Within the complexities in healthcare, as well as the everchanging environment in healthcare, it is important that the company is able to tell the MediXall story in a way that resonates with our desired audience and create a user experience that emphasizes value. To ensure consistent messaging and user experience throughout the MediXall Platform, accelerate the company’s visibility and build credibility for the MediXall brand, we initiated a high-quality internal product design and marketing team. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Developed Health Karma seeking to take Advantage of New Technologies. We developed the Health Karma Healthcare Ecosystem as a unified online environment connecting physicians and other healthcare providers to patients, and payers to the providers, across all healthcare settings. We believe that this has positioned it as a dynamic distribution platform that attracts and supports new generations of healthcare technologies and services, delivering innovative solutions benefiting Health Karma, our end-users, and the healthcare industry as a whole.

Our Market Opportunity
 
We believe that favorable macro-economic trends, in combination with the expansion of our capabilities, present significant opportunities for on-demand and consumer driven healthcare to address the most pressing, universal healthcare challenges through solutions, such as ours.
 
Barriers and inefficiencies in healthcare systems around the world present market participants with major global challenges such as:
 

● | consumers lack sufficient access to high quality, cost effective healthcare at appropriate sites of care, while bearing an increasing share of costs; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2
-


● | employers and health plans lack effective solutions that reduce costs while enhancing healthcare access for beneficiaries; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | providers lack flexibility to increase productivity by delivering healthcare on their own terms. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Traditional market participants are therefore increasingly unable to effectively and efficiently receive, deliver or administer healthcare. At the same time, the emergence of technology platforms solving massive structural challenges in other industries has highlighted the need for similar solutions in healthcare. We believe there is a significant opportunity to solve these challenges through an online solution, such as ours, that matches consumer demand and physician supply in real-time, while offering health plans and employers an attractive, cost-effective healthcare alternative for their beneficiaries. We believe that MediXall.com offers a solution to address these challenges.
 
Rising Healthcare Costs. Healthcare spending, overall, is very high in the United States, and growing. From 2005 to 2018, health care spending in the United States tripled. According to the 2018 National Health Expenditures Report by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), healthcare spending reached nearly $3.6 trillion, up 4.6% from 2017. About 10% of that $3.6 trillion spent on health care was paid for directly by consumers through out-of-pocket costs, which was about $375.6 billion. That makes healthcare one of the country’s largest industries, equaling approximately 17.7% of gross domestic product (“GDP”). In comparison, health care costs were $27.2 billion in 1960, just 5% of GDP. That translates to an annual health care cost of $11,172 per person in 2018 versus just $146 per person in 1960. Health care costs have risen faster than annual income. According to the CMS National Health Expenditure Projections 2018-2027 Forecast Summary Report, U.S. health care spending is projected to reach nearly $6.0 trillion by 2027, 19.4% of GDP. Furthermore, the average insurance premium for consumers has risen 22% over the past five years, to $7,188 for single coverage in 2019, and to nearly $20,576 for family coverage, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation’s 2019 Employer Health Benefits Survey Report. However, only 80% of health insurance premiums go towards paying for service, while the other 20% is lost in administrative overhead. Oftentimes healthcare providers go unpaid for months, or longer — causing ever increasing costs. Despite employers paying about three quarters of their workers’ premiums, according to the Society for Human Resource Management, individual workers’ health costs have gone up as well. In addition to premium increases, their out-of-pocket costs, which include what they spend for deductibles, co-pays and co-insurance, have risen too. According to a 2019 Kaiser Family Foundation’s analysis of IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database and KFF Employer Health Benefits Survey, 2018, between 2008 and 2018, health costs incurred by families covered by large employers – including premium contributions and out-of-pocket spending on health services – has increased 67% from $4,617 to $7,726.
 
Wasteful spending amidst rising costs in U.S. healthcare system. According to the “Waste in the US Health Care System” research report published in 2019 by the Journal of the American Medical Association, estimated cost of waste in the US health care system ranged from $760 billion to $935 billion, accounting for approximately 25% of total health care spending. Examples of waste include failure to adhere to best care practices and lack of care coordination, which leads to unnecessary readmissions and inappropriate levels of care delivery. Wasteful spending includes significant variation among providers in the cost and quality of similar care from provider to provider and market to market that is not explained by geography alone and also includes overtreatment, which is testing and care that is not medically beneficial. Additionally, the healthcare system has many inefficient processes that are manual, complex, frequently changing and time consuming, are prone to error, costly and require undue amounts of clinicians’ and other professionals’ time. According to the CMS National Health Expenditure Projections 2018-2027 Forecast Summary Report, this implies that healthcare spending is increasing at a 5.6% annual growth rate, or 3.2% higher than expected inflation over the same period. Given the significant and lasting financial burden of ongoing rising costs and wasteful spending on society, both governmental and commercial payers and providers are increasingly focused on reducing costs attributable to administrative complexity and errors, excessive manual labor, and uncoordinated, unproductive, ineffective care whose value is not well determined or communicated. As a result, we expect continued strong demand for solutions that can aid in reducing waste, improve efficiency and help ensure delivery of clinically appropriate, value-based care.
 
Increasing consumerism in healthcare. As patients pay an ever-growing share of their healthcare costs, they are increasingly demanding higher quality care, increased cost transparency, shared decision making and convenience. According to the Master Patient Experience Survey 2020 by Software Advice, almost three quarters, 71% of surveyed patients use online reviews as the very first step to finding a new doctor. As such, patient experience and satisfaction are becoming important priorities for providers as they compete to attract and retain new patients. Moreover, healthcare providers are increasingly becoming more patient- centric due to increased competition and development of more targeted technologies. We believe the healthcare industry has significantly lagged behind other consumer-centric industries, such as retail, banking and entertainment. We believe that technology can enable patients to assume greater control of their own health, and research has shown that activated, engaged patients have better health experiences and better outcomes.

Consumerism has entered the healthcare industry with force. Consumers have become the fastest-growing payer of healthcare services. As with any purchase, the more you pay, the more you expect in return. As out-of-pocket healthcare costs balloon, consumers demand more from healthcare organizations. After decades of consumer-averse thinking and less-than-exceptional experiences, consumers have grown sick and tired of an industry meant to keep them well. Once an afterthought in a system built around physicians and payers, consumers are now better informed, less patient, and laser-focused on quality and cost. Having cut their teeth on experiences with a broad range of industries, consumers now come to healthcare with great expectations.
 
Increasing patient financial responsibility in healthcare. The unsustainable levels of spending on healthcare and extreme inefficiencies in the system have driven an increased focus by employers and health plans to control healthcare expenditures. As these healthcare expenditures continue to rise, employers and health systems have shifted more of the cost to patients through increased cost sharing and the use of high-deductible health plans. According to a 2019 Kaiser Family Foundation’s analysis of IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database and KFF Employer Health Benefits Survey, 2018, between 2008 and 2018, health costs incurred by families covered by large employers – including premium contributions and out-of-pocket spending on health services – has increased 67% from $4,617 to $7,726, These trends have resulted in significant increases in out-of-pocket patient spending, which CMS expects to total $586 billion by 2027. The emergence of the patient as a major payer of healthcare is a dramatic shift in the industry payment landscape, which has historically been between the insurer and healthcare provider organization. We believe that healthcare provider organizations have had ineffective channels to communicate and transact directly with patients, and traditional approaches have lacked personalization and data- driven analysis. Increases in patient financial responsibility require provider staff to obtain payment from the patient before and after the point of care, tasks that are best accomplished with more automated registration, billing and collection workflows, as well as patient-centric payment options. Against this backdrop, patients have historically struggled to understand their bills. According to the 2017 McKinsey & Company Healthcare Industry analysis, by some estimates, healthcare provider organizations collect only half of patient balances after initial visit, which contributes to incremental financial pressure.
 
The Healthcare Opportunity
 

While the U.S. leads the world in medical research and biotech breakthroughs, it also has the world’s costliest care system, representing nearly 18% of GDP. Healthcare spending, overall, is very high in the United States, and growing. From 2005 to 2018, health care spending in the United States tripled. According to the 2018 National Health Expenditures Report by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), healthcare spending reached nearly $3.6 trillion, up 4.6% from 2017. About 10% of that $3.6 trillion spent on health care was paid for directly by consumers through out-of-pocket costs, which was about $375.6 billion. In addition, about a third of $3.6 trillion dollars in annual spending is wasted —lost in paperwork, unnecessary procedures, lack of coordination, and other inefficiencies.

That all translates into rising insurance premiums and higher deductibles. The proliferation of high deductible health plans we are seeing today marks the beginning of the return of the individual health care consumer. Before a patient reaches and exceeds their insurance deductible, a patient shopping for an MRI, a strep test, or just about anything else, will act just like any other customer shopping in the market for any other goods or services. For any purchase before hitting the deductible, the patient is “paying with their own money,” and will be price sensitive, therefore willing to shop around among different providers of the same medical service.
 
However, unlike most other consumer-driven transactions, there is a significant outside influence driving patients’ decisions: Health insurance. 
 
Health insurance introduces cost uncertainty into virtually every patient-driven decision. As reported in the 2018 Alegeus Consumer Health & Financial Fluency Report, consumers don’t understand the basics of health insurance. Nearly half (42%) said they “aren’t confident they understand how health insurance works.” Half (50%) said they “don’t know what counts toward their deductible.” And nearly half (45%) “don’t know how to validate whether a procedure is covered by their plan.” Alegeus also found that more than half (51%) of respondents couldn’t figure out what they would likely pay out-of-pocket during their plan year, which is a considerable source of financial stress.
 
Most people know what a premium is when it comes to their insurance, because they have to pay it every month. But when PolicyGenius surveyed more than 2,000 Americans to see if they could define four other key health insurance terms: deductible, co-insurance, co-pay, and out-of-pocket maximum, only 4% of Americans could actually define all four terms.

All this research indicates that a large number of consumers don’t fully understand the basic language of healthcare and health insurance. As a result, patients are understandably confused about what their healthcare will cost - they regularly can’t understand their medical bills, have difficulty finding out what doctor they should go to and how much they will have to pay out of their own pocket or even what payment options are available. All this leads to hesitancy to their buying decisions when it comes to healthcare. 
 

Our Opportunity to Remove the Confusion from Healthcare
 
No one wants to spend their hard-earned money without knowing what they're purchasing and how much it will cost. At MediXall, we ask one simple question: Why should Healthcare be any different?
 
Consumers are still navigating the confounding, expensive maze of healthcare largely alone. The industry remains geared around reactive care. While some companies have emerged that are helping consumers become educated advocates along their care journey, we have yet to see a platform that we believe can offer complete support to consumers through their entire healthcare journey.

Accordingly, MediXall has sought to address the following in the MediXall Platform:
 

● | Creating a shopping marketplace for healthcare services, breaking the traditional local network model. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reversing the flow of the healthcare relationship/interaction model and become a trusted adviser on the consumer’s side for a spectrum of needs (imagine a healthcare and wellness concierge that helps consumers make informed decisions). 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Integrating deep understanding of consumer habits, motivation, and history to “activate” consumers to live healthy lives. There’s a market void for players to jump in and function as a “GPS for health.”

Description of Our Products and Services - MediXall.com / Health Karma
 
Seeking to take advantage of this market opportunity, we launched the MediXall.com platform marketplace throughout Florida beginning in 2019 in a controlled launch, and we launched Health Karma throughout the U.S. in a beta release beginning in August 2020 and nationwide public launch in November 2020. Since the public launch in the fourth quarter of 2020, the second generation of MediXall.com, Health Karma is available through our website at www.GetHealthKarma.com.
 
The U.S. healthcare system is a minefield for employees and their families, full of unknown differences in total costs and quality within a plan network. From choosing a healthcare provider and managing bills to understanding benefits, navigating the healthcare system is complex. Employers and their employees share the unnecessary costs of choosing the wrong provider and can benefit greatly from ensuring that the choice of every consumer is guided toward the highest value for everyone.
 
Typical transparency tools and provider directories fail members and employers in two ways: they publish confusing price ranges across similar facilities without intelligent guidance that includes quality and appropriate settings of care, and they deliver low engagement rates because they assume consumers are eager shoppers, which is proven to be false by leading academic research.
 
The reality is that healthcare costs start when people choose a doctor. Choosing the wrong doctor can have a snowball effect, resulting not only in poor care decisions, but also in wasting money on unnecessary, expensive care. Health Karma seeks to give people the information they need to select the right doctor or the right care from the start, and provide ongoing support throughout their healthcare journey— aiming to save money for people and their companies, while also improving care.
 
Health Karma™ is a free tool for consumers that seeks to bring cost transparency and choice to healthcare, aiming to eliminate financial surprises and empowering people to make more informed decisions - with or without health insurance.
 
Research has shown that more consumers are focused on convenience and cost. However, healthcare can be difficult to navigate, is fragmented, and consumers are often unsure what doctor they should go to and how much they will have to pay out of their own pocket or even what payment options are available. Through user feedback from the controlled launch of MediXall.com in Florida, we learned the patients’ obstacles during their healthcare journey was not initially in booking the appointment but the confusion and lack of understanding of what their healthcare will cost and which doctors they should go to. The following are the most the most common obstacles we identified: 
 

● | Consumers aren’t sure about the network status of their doctors, which conflicts with the need to see an in-network doctor to avoid very expensive medical bills 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Insurance networks are confusing – the same type of doctor in the same hospital could be in-network or out-of-network 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Consumers do not know or understand their health plan coverage details 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Lack of understanding about how much is owed for medical services and if the amount is a fair price 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Lack of understanding about the amount covered by their health insurance 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Financial and emotional pressure, often at a difficult time, leaving patients poorly positioned to make smart decisions 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Leveraging all the information and feedback we gathered during the controlled launch through its partners, we have now developed the next generation of MediXall.com, Health Karma™, seeking to remove the complexity, decision fatigue and unrelenting confusion that faces the average patient every day in the US health system.
 
Seeking to address the above obstacles, MediXall Group developed Health Karma™, as a platform that uses the power of big data to pair transparency with personalization, giving consumers a clear, robust view of care options, enabling them to get the most out of their healthcare.

Benefits to Healthcare Networks

Our partnership model seeks to allow health networks to augment their network strategies, without significant additional investment in capital, technology or management resources. We believe that partnering with us can be a more effective, expeditious, economical, and less risky way of developing a coordinated network. Additionally, we believe that our model can better position health networks with consumers and employers by focusing on consumer-driven care and facilitating direct-to-employer relationships.

We digitally integrate our modernized healthcare marketplace model with our health network partners’ provider networks, better coordinating care for users across a continuum of settings. Through better coordination, we seek to provide users with more seamless access to specialty care when needed. We simultaneously seek to reduce excessive health network administrative costs by linking our referral processes and digital technologies with health network partners. We believe that this coordination of care can lead to better experiences and outcomes for users, as well as reduced costs.

Our Technology
 
MediXall’s underlying technology is a highly scalable, integrated, application program interface or API-driven technology platform. The platform has been built to accommodate the seamless and quick introduction of new services, technologies and functionality that we have introduced through strategic partnerships.
 
Our proprietary technology platform powers all aspects of our company: engaging members, supporting providers, and advancing business objectives. Our technology is grounded in human-centered design thinking and leverages insights from behavioral design. Our product designers and engineers collaborate closely with our operational team members, as well as our healthcare advisors and providers in the Health Karma Network to observe and then optimize workflows. We employ user testing and experiment-driven design (such as A/B testing) to enhance our member and provider experiences.

Our platform is built on a modern cloud-based technology stack, employing Agile development cycles and a DevOps approach to infrastructure. Unlike with traditional healthcare IT, our technology platform is updated frequently, without long upgrade cycles. Our modular, service-oriented architecture utilizes API standards for ease of implementing new functionalities and integrating with external systems. Data is at the heart of our technology. We integrate machine learning and natural language processing to automate recommendations and workflows, uncovering insights that we incorporate back into the design of the platform. 
 
We are focused on building a modern, integrated technology platform the encapsulates functionalities seen in many fragmented health care and other IT solutions, including: customer relationship and membership management tools, population health solutions, patient portals, patient health records, scheduling systems, resource management tools, contact center software, virtual care offerings, practice management systems, reporting and analytics packages, amongst others. 
 
With the opportunities and growth trajectory in front of the company, we believe that we have built a high-quality internal development team capable of making critical product development decisions daily in order to maintain speed. Speed to market is a critical factor in success.
 
Provider Growth Strategy
 
To date, we have launched the MediXall.com marketplace throughout Florida beginning in 2019 in a controlled launch, and we have launched Health Karma throughout the U.S. in a beta release beginning in August 2020 and nationwide public launch in November 2020.
 
Before launching nationwide, we licensed healthcare provider & practice information, as well as insurance plan information from third-party data providers and created individual pages for each provider location in the entire country. This has led to over 1,000,000 doctor profiles throughout all 50 states on the platform. Consumers now have the ability to integrate over 2,000 insurance plans and navigate through any providers on our platform and filter by in-network or out-of-network among other filters. We will be able to let the provider claim their own profile on the platform where they can attract new cash patients. These patients will be able to directly book appointments on the platform which we will charge the provider a technology fee per booking. In time, this growth drives powerful network effects whereby more provider listings and functionality expand the breadth and depth of our engaged userbase.
 
As we add more healthcare providers and consumers to our platform, we attract more technology developers and strategic partners who can leverage our userbase and use our API to develop additional apps and services that extend the capabilities of our Health Karma Platform. At scale, we believe that our platform reaches a critical mass of consumers and active local healthcare provider accounts, and we begin an active sales effort to local providers, as well as regional and national provider networks. Thereafter, modest incremental investment is required to support revenue growth. In markets that have attained this level of development, we expect to achieve economies of scale and operating cost leverage.
 
Sales & Marketing
 
Health Karma has carried out minimal consumer marketing to date and has been focused on increasing the number of providers on its platform to attract consumers to the platform by providing a choice of locations, availability and pricing. With Health Karma’s launch, our plan is to lead the wide scale roll-out of its services shifting our marketing and sales initiatives focus on member growth through two primary avenues: directly acquiring consumer users, and signing agreements with employers that will offer Health Karma and associated products and services as part of their benefits packages. We use marketing and sales strategies to reach consumers as well as employee benefits leaders. Employer marketing and sales strategies also include account-based marketing, business development initiatives, and client service teams focused on customer acquisition, employee enrollment, and member engagement. 
Consumer Sales & Marketing 
 
When we market and sell directly to individuals, we initially plan to focus on increasing brand awareness, followed by performance marketing targeted toward user acquisition, activation and engagement. 
 
Our marketing strategy in new markets is primarily centered on increasing overall brand awareness, familiarity, consideration and ultimately enrollment. We have carefully developed a robust marketing plan to achieve these objectives.

SEO, Social & Traditional - We will drive brand awareness and conversions to our platform using social media marketing via Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, and others. In addition, we plan to leverage SEO & SEM to enhance Health Karma’s search presence both organically and paid. 
 
Content Marketing - We consistently release marketing content through our blog that aims to educate our audience about the value that our product provides. We also develop thought leadership content such as whitepapers, eBooks, and infographics and use public relations to secure earned media placements. Our content marketing efforts aim to influence and persuade readers without having to rely solely on conventional direct selling tactics. 
 
Influencer Marketing - We will launch an initiative to guest blog articles and features in healthcare, personal finance, and startup tech publications like TechCrunch, Wired, VentureBeat, and other outlets in our industry. Additionally, we participate in industry conferences, and may partner with media outlets, event venues, local businesses, and social media influencers to increase brand awareness. 
 
As brand awareness increases in more established markets, we plan to shift our efforts to performance marketing focused on both customer acquisition and engagement. Our performance marketing initiatives include customized task-based in-app messages and email communications to drive engagement among members, in addition to more targeted advertisements through direct mail, Google Search, YouTube and social media for member acquisition.
 
Employer Sales & Marketing 
 
As we begin to accelerate the roll out of Health Karma to employers, we plan to develop and expand our in-house employer sales force to be comprised of sales professionals who will be organized by geography and customer size. We support our sales force in several ways, including through account-based marketing resources and the deployment of a business development team to educate employer decision makers on the benefits of offering Health Karma to their employees. We also will leverage sales analytics to further support lead generation. Additionally, our client success team actively manages our customer accounts and provides in-depth support. 
 
We also work with channel partners such as payroll and professional employer organizations to reach smaller employer clients. Additionally, we partner with select regional and national benefits brokers and consultants to educate potential customers on our offerings.
 
Customer and Consumer Services and Support
 
We believe that many medical & dental practice owners, as well as other healthcare and wellness business owners are not technical experts and that they bear an enormous responsibility to successfully run their businesses day in and day out. Therefore, we aim to provide end-to-end customer support, including full profile data conversion and import, live onboarding and technical support via telephone, email, and screen sharing; in-software self-service tools; advanced professional services; and educational events. In addition, we also have a dedicated support team that is focused on seeking to ensure that registered Health Karma users are having the best possible experience.

● | Customer Onboarding. We typically onboard new customers with live training sessions delivered via telephone and web conference. These trainings are supplemented by self- service setup checklists, online help materials and webinars. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Customer Success. To identify opportunities for greater adoption of our products and services and to further help our customers be more successful on our platform, we engage with them to better understand their business goals and objectives; provide targeted education about relevant features, products and services as well as business best practices; and develop a recommended success plan with periodic outreach to check in on their progress. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Ongoing Customer Support. Inclusive with being a member of the Health Karma Provider Network, we offer customer service and support via phone, chat, emails and self-help knowledge centers. All customer service and support is provided by our in-house personnel who are invested in MediXall’s core values and closely connected to our Product, Technology and Experience team.

Revenue Model
 
MediXall seeks to generate the financial return on the supply side of the marketplace (providers of healthcare services). We aim to monetize through technology fees paid by providers on each pre-paid cash booking on the marketplace and monthly subscription fees for use of the premium insurance booking functionality.
 
On the provider acquisition end, we continue to build relationships with potential healthcare provider network partners with regional and national reach, as we believe that this allows us to much more efficiently scale the provider side of the marketplace. By partnering with MediXall, health networks can better connect with consumers and employers by focusing on consumer-driven care and facilitating direct-to-employer relationships.
 
Our revenue model is comprised of four primary components:
 

1. | Technology fees on each cash booking (Pre-paid) 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Subscription fees for premium booking functionality (Bookings) 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Fees in regards to 3rd party payers i.Employers, School Districts, etc. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Partner Product and Services Revenue Share Fee 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Technology Fees. Revenue we expect to earn from providers for the use of the technology, once a patient requests the appointment from that specific provider. This is a flat fee, in which all providers pay outstanding fees on a monthly basis to MediXall.
 
Subscription and Services. With the Company’s controlled launch of the platform, early-adopter providers were able to join the platform for one year at no cost. During this time, the provider was only subject to technology fees as they accrue. We are leveraging this provider user base and associated data to refine the Health Karma Platform, identify what works and what does not work and offer enhancements and upgrades for Subscription fees. As we begin the broader-based market rollout of the Health Karma, we expect subscription and services revenue will be generated primarily from sales of subscriptions and additional features for the platform. We expect most of subscription fees to be prepaid by subscribers on a monthly basis via a credit card and, to a lesser extent, billed to subscribers on an annual or quarterly basis.
 
Partner Product and Services. Health Karma Network members can choose to enter into a separate contract with MediXall technology partners to purchase additional features and functionalities, as well as other products and services. We receive a revenue share from these arrangements from our technology partners, which is recorded when earned. Additionally, we intend to develop Health Karma API, which will create a revenue stream from API platform partners for subscriber site access, data query, and consumer bookings.
Regulatory Environment
 
Participants in the health care industry are required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations in the United States at the federal and state levels as well as applicable international laws. Although many regulatory and governmental requirements do not directly apply to our business, our customers are required to comply with a variety of laws, and we may be affected by these laws as a result of our contractual obligations. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the Unites States, both at the federal and state level, which could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business. We have attempted to structure our operations to comply with applicable legal requirements, but there can be no assurance that our operations will not be challenged or impacted by enforcement initiatives.
Healthcare Reform
 
Our business could be affected by changes in health care laws, including without limitation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”), which was enacted in March 2010. The ACA has changed how health care services are covered, delivered and reimbursed through expanded coverage of individuals, changes in Medicare program spending and insurance market reforms. Ongoing government and legislative initiatives may bring about other changes.
 
While most of the provisions of the ACA and other health care reform legislation will not be directly applicable to us, they may affect the business of many of our customers, which may in turn affect our business. Although we are unable to predict with any reasonable certainty or otherwise quantify the likely impact of the ACA, any amendment or repeal of the ACA, or other health care reform on our business model, financial condition, or results of operations, negative changes in the business of our customers and the number of individuals they insure may negatively impact our business.

Requirements Regarding the Privacy and Security of Personal Information
 
U.S.- HIPAA and Other Privacy and Security Requirements. There are many U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personal health information. Additionally , regulations promulgated pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations (collectively, “HIPAA”), establishes privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of protected health information and require the implementation of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of individually identifiable health information in electronic form. Any health plan customers, as well as health care clearinghouses and certain providers with which we may have or may establish business relationships, are covered entities that are regulated under HIPAA. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), which became effective on February 17, 2010, significantly expanded HIPAA’s privacy and security requirements. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” who are independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. Under HIPAA and our contractual agreements with our customers, we are considered a “business associate” to our customers and thus are directly subject to HIPAA’s privacy and security standards. In order to provide our covered entity customers with services that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information, HIPAA requires our customers to enter into business associate agreements with it. Such agreements must, among other things, require us to:

● | limit how we will use and disclose the protected health information; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | implement reasonable administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information from misuse; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | enter into similar agreements with our agents and subcontractors that have access to the information; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | report security incidents, breaches and other inappropriate uses or disclosures of the information; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | assist the customer in question with certain duties under the privacy standards. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition to HIPAA regulations, we may be subject to other state and federal privacy laws, including laws that prohibit unfair or deceptive practices and laws that place specific requirements on use of data. Such state laws can be similar to or even more protective than HIPAA, in which case we must comply with the more stringent law. As a result, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations in order to ensure we are in compliance with the stricter state laws.
 
Data Protection and Breaches. In recent years, there have been a number of well-publicized data breaches involving the improper use and disclosure of individuals’ personal information. Many states have responded to these incidents by enacting laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals and state officials. In addition, under HIPAA, we must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to our contractual partners within 60 days of discovery of the breach. Notification must also be made to HHS and, in certain circumstances involving large breaches, to the media. Under the GDPR, the data controller is required to report personal data breaches to the supervisory authority within 72 hours of discovery of the breach.
 
We have implemented and maintained physical, technical and administrative safeguards intended to protect all personal data, and have processes in place to assist it in complying with all applicable laws, regulations and contractual requirements regarding the protection of these data and properly responding to any security breaches or incidents. However, we cannot be sure that these safeguards are adequate to protect all personal data or to assist us in complying with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the privacy and security of personal data and responding to any security breaches or incidents. Furthermore, in many cases, applicable state laws, including breach notification requirements, are not preempted by the HIPAA privacy and security standards and are subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities, thereby complicating our compliance efforts. Additionally, state and federal laws regarding deceptive practices may apply to public assurances we give to individuals about the security of services we provide on behalf of our contractual customers.

Other Healthcare Regulations
 
In addition to data privacy laws, our operations and arrangements with healthcare professionals, clients, and third-party payors may subject us to various federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, including without limitation fraud and abuse laws, such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute; civil and criminal false claims laws; physician transparency laws; and state laws regarding the corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting prohibitions. These laws may impact, among other things, our sales and marketing operations, and our interactions with healthcare professionals. We continually monitor legislative, regulatory and judicial developments related to licensure and engagement arrangements with professionals; however, new agency interpretations, federal or state legislation or regulations, or judicial decisions could require us to change how we operate, may increase our costs of services and could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
 
Other Requirements. In addition to HIPAA, numerous other U.S. state and federal laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to and confidentiality of individually identifiable health information and health care provider information. Some states also are considering new laws and regulations that further protect the confidentiality, privacy and security of medical records or other types of medical information. In many cases, these state laws are not preempted by the HIPAA privacy standards and may be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities. Further, Congress and a number of states have considered or are considering prohibitions or limitations on the disclosure of medical or other information to individuals or entities located outside of the United States.

Corporate History
 
MediXall Group, Inc. was incorporated on December 21, 1998 under the laws of the State of Nevada under the name of IP Gate, Inc. The Company had various name changes since, to reflect changes in the Company’s operating strategies. The Company has the following wholly-owned subsidiaries: (1) IHL of Florida, Inc., which is dormant, (2) Medixall Financial Group, which is dormant, (3) Medixaid, Inc., and (4) MediXall.com, Inc., which were established to carry out the development and operation of our healthcare marketplace platform, and (5) Health Karma, Inc. which was established in 2020 to increase functionality of the MediXall platform.
 
In December 2002, IP Gate, Inc. merged with Action Stocks, Inc. In June 2003, Action Stocks, Inc. merged with Classic Health Systems Inc. and changed its name to Specialized Home Medical Services, Inc. Specialized Home Medical Services changed its name to IGSM Group, Inc. (“IGSM”) in April 2007. In December 2012, the Company contracted the services of TBG, which assisted with restructuring the Company into a short-line and regional freight railroad holding company. In June 2013, IGSM acquired all of the outstanding stock of Transportation Management Services, Inc. in exchange for the issuance of 1,500,000 shares of preferred IGSM stock. IGSM changed its name to Continental Rail Corp. in July 2013.
 
On June 19, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with Continental Rail, LLC (“LLC”) and the Series A Preferred Shareholders of the Company. The Company was actively seeking to secure financing for the purchase of the Delta Southern Railroad (“Delta”), a Class III short-line railroad headquartered in Tallulah, Louisiana. Delta was subsequently purchased by Golden Gate Capital (“Golden Gate”), a private equity firm in San Francisco, California. Golden Gate decided that it was in its best interest to utilize the railroad operations management skills of certain Preferred Shareholders of the Company to manage the daily operations of Delta (“the Manager”). By the terms of the Agreement, however the Delta Manager cannot be owned (more than 10%) or controlled by a public company. Consequently, the LLC was organized by the Preferred Shareholders as the vehicle to manage Delta and satisfy the conditions set forth in the agreement. In conjunction with this transaction the Company received a 10% interest in the LLC and the preferred shareholders returned their preferred shares to the Company for cancelation.
 
On June 24, 2016, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement with TBG pursuant to which the Company exchanged 100% of its membership interest in the LLC in exchange for 1,000,000 shares of the Company held by TBG. The 1,000,000 shares were cancelled.
 
On November 22, 2016, Continental Rail Corp. effected a 1-for-15 reverse stock split of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock. On December 13, 2016, the Company effected a share exchange and reorganization (the “Merger”) with IHL of Florida, Inc., incorporated in April 2016 and under common control with the Company. Pursuant to the Merger, IHL shareholders transferred to the Company all their issued and outstanding shares of capital stock. In exchange, the Company agreed to issue 41,131,000 shares of common stock to IHL shareholders, including 18,599,750 shares issued to common control parties and 264,894 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, all issued to common control parties, and convertible into 24,900,000 shares of common stock. The share issuances represent approximately 94.1% of the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company post-closing. As a result, the Company (i) became the 100% parent of IHL; (ii) assumed the operations of IHL; and (iii) changed its name from Continental Rail Corp. to MediXall Group, Inc. The Merger was accounted for as a transfer of the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities under the predecessor value method of accounting. The consolidated financial statements include both entities’ full results since the inception of IHL in April 2016.
 
Prior to the Merger, on July 8, 2016, IHL entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with MediXall, Inc. MediXall, Inc. had no material operations prior to the share exchange which resulted in the acquisition of $2,200 of debt and no assets or revenue generating activities.
