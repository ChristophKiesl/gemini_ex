Item 1. Description of Business
 
All references in this report to “Milestone Scientific,” “us,” “our,” “we,” or “Milestone” refer to Milestone Scientific Inc., and its consolidated subsidiaries, Wand Dental,  Milestone Advanced Cosmetic and Milestone Medical (all described below) and affiliate, Milestone Education (described below), unless the context otherwise indicates. Milestone Scientific is the owner of the following registered U.S. trademarks: CompuDent®; CompuMed®; CompuFlo®; DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing Technology®; Milestone Scientific ®; the Milestone logo ®; SafetyWand®; STA Single Tooth Anesthesia System®; and The Wand ®.
 
Milestone Scientific was incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 1989. Milestone Scientific has developed a proprietary, computer-controlled anesthetic delivery instrument, through the use of The Wand®, a single use disposable handpiece. The instrument is marketed in dentistry under the trademark CompuDent®, and STA Single Tooth Anesthesia System® and in medicine under the trademark CompuMed®. CompuDent® is suitable for all dental procedures that require local anesthetic. CompuMed® is suitable for many medical procedures regularly performed in Plastic Surgery, Hair Restoration Surgery, Podiatry, Colorectal Surgery, Dermatology, Orthopedics and a number of other disciplines. The dental instruments are sold in the United States and in over 47 countries abroad. To date there have been no medical instruments sold in the United States and limited amounts sold internationally, although certain medical instruments have obtained CE mark approval and now can be marketed and sold in most European countries.  Milestone Scientific's products are manufactured by a third-party contract manufacturer. 
 
In May 2014, Milestone Scientific completed a private placement (the “May 2014 Financing”), which raised aggregate gross proceeds $10 million, from the sale of $3 million of our common stock, $.001 par value per share (“common stock”) (two million shares at $1.50 per share) and $7 million of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (“preferred stock”) (7,000 shares at $1,000 per share), convertible into common stock at $2.37 per share (as adjusted to date) on May 14, 2019, or $1.50 per share if certain conditions are not met; both subject to anti-dilution adjustment.
 
In July 2014, Milestone Scientific acquired all of the outstanding shares of an inactive Florida corporation and changed its name to Wand Dental, Inc. ("Wand Dental"). In September 2014, that corporation was merged into a Delaware corporation, retaining the same name and capitalization. On July 1, 2014, Wand Dental was capitalized with cash and the contribution by Milestone Scientific of its dental business and related dental assets including the exclusive license of Milestone Scientific's patents, trademarks, and technology for use in the dental marketplace.
 
On June 1, 2015, our common stock was listed on the NYSE MKT LLC (“NYSE MKT”) under the ticker symbol “MLSS”.
 
In June 2016, we raised an additional $2.0 million of gross proceeds in a private placement of one million shares of common stock, at a price of $2.00 per share, to the same investors that participated in the May 2014 financing.
 
In the second quarter of 2016, Milestone Scientific initiated a share exchange program pursuant to which we exchanged one share of common stock for every two outstanding shares of Milestone Medical (described below) common stock, a previously consolidated variable interest entity. As a result of the exchange program, at December 31, 2016, Milestone Scientific owned approximately 91% of Milestone Medical.

In July 2016, Milestone Scientific raised gross proceeds of $250,000 in a registered direct offering of 104,200 shares of common stock at $2.40 per share. The transaction was covered by the prospectus supplement, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on July 22, 2016, to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (SEC File No.: 333-209466). 
 
In July 2016, Milestone Scientific filed for 510(k) marketing clearance with the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") Milestone Medical's epidural anesthetic injections instrument. This clearance is necessary to begin commercialization of these medical instruments in the United States.
 
In December 2016, we received notification from the FDA that based upon the 510(k) application submitted for the Company's Compu-Flo Intra Articular Computer Controlled Injection System, out did not adequately document that the device met the equivalency standard required for 510(k) clearance. Following consultation with the FDA Office of Device Evaluation, we intend to provide additional data, which could include a new Human Factor Validation study (HFV Study) in support of a new 510(k) application for the device. An HFV Study demonstrates the ease of use of a product. The cost to generate this incremental data is estimated to be approximately $100,000. 
 
In December 2016, we completed an underwritten public offering of 2,000,000 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to 1,592,775 shares of common stock, including 92,775 additional warrants pursuant to a partial exercise of the over-allotment option granted to the underwriters. The public offering price for each share and related warrant was $1.50. The warrants have a three-year term and an exercise price of $2.55 per share. In January 2017, the underwriter exercised a portion of its over-allotment option to purchase an additional 123,700 shares of common stock at the public offering price of $1.499 per share. The gross proceeds from this offering, including proceeds from partial exercises of the over-allotment option, were approximately $3,200,000, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. This offering was covered by the prospectus supplement, filed with the SEC on December 16, 2016, to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (SEC File No.: 333-209466). 
 
           As of December 31, 2016, Milestone Scientific's financial statements are consolidated to include the accounts of its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries including, Wand Dental, Milestone Advanced Cosmetic Systems, Inc., ("Milestone Advance Cosmetic"), and Milestone Medical Inc. ("Milestone Medical"). Milestone Education LLC ("Milestone Education") is a variable interest entity of which Milestone Scientific is the primary beneficiary and is consolidated into Milestone Scientific's financial statements as of January 1, 2016.     
 
BUSINESS
 
Background
 
Since its inception, Milestone Scientific has engaged in pioneering proprietary, innovative, computer-controlled injection technologies and solutions for the medical and dental markets. Milestone Scientific has focused its resources on redefining the worldwide standard of care for injection techniques by making the experience more comfortable for the patient and by reducing the anxiety and stress of administering injections for the healthcare provider. 
Milestone Scientific and its technology are widely recognized by key opinion leaders, industry experts and medical and dental practitioners as the noted leader in the emerging, high growth, computer-controlled injection industry; and remains intent on expanding the use and application of its proprietary, patented technologies to achieve greater operational efficiencies, enhanced patient safety and therapeutic adherence, and improved quality of care within a broad range of medical disciplines.
 
In 1997, Milestone Scientific first introduced The Wand® (CompuDent® instrument) and the disposable Wand® handpiece. CompuDent® provides painless injections for all routine dental treatments, including implants, root canals, crowns, fillings and cleanings. Milestone Scientific's Computer-Controlled Local Anesthetic Delivery (C-CLAD) instrument handpiece does not look or feel like a syringe.

Milestone Scientific expanded its product offerings with the introduction of its CompuMed® advanced injection instrument, designed for use in a wide range of applications within the medical industry, including cosmetic surgery, hair restoration surgery, podiatry, colorectal surgery, nasal and sinus surgery, dermatology and orthopedics, among others. 
 
In 2007, Milestone Scientific received FDA 510(k) clearance for the marketing and sale of its STA Single Tooth Anesthesia System® instruments (dental instrument). Milestone Scientific introduced the instrument to the market in February 2007 and this instrument is currently being marketed throughout the world.
 
Central to Milestone Scientific’s intellectual property platform and current product development strategy is its patented CompuFlo® technology for the precise delivery of medicaments. The CompuFlo® pressure/force Computer-Controlled Local Anesthetic Delivery (C-CLAD) technology is an advanced, patented and FDA-approved medical technology for the painless and accurate delivery of drugs, anesthetics and other medicaments into all tissue types, as well as for the aspiration of bodily fluids or previously injected substances. Its regulation and control of flow rate continues to provide the CompuDent® benefits of painless injections, while its DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing Technology® capability provides visual and audible in-tissue pressure feedback, identifying tissue types to the healthcare provider. This pressure feedback extends the benefit of painlessness from anesthetics with known viscosities to a wide range of liquid drugs and other medicaments with varying viscosities and flow rates. The DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing Technology® also allows the healthcare provider to know when certain types of tissues have been penetrated and permits the healthcare provider to inject medicaments precisely at the desired location. Thus, pressure feedback can prevent the suffusion of tissue outside the intended target area, a vitally important characteristic in the injection of chemotherapeutics and other toxic substances.
 
The CompuFlo® technology consists of two critical elements. One element is the ability to determine exit pressure In Situ (in the injection site tissue) at the tip of the needle. This minimizes tissue damage (and eliminates the pain of the injection) because the flow rate and pressure of the injection are controlled. The other critical element of the technology is an integrated injection database of algorithms that have been defined which allow for the measurement of the exit pressure. This database of algorithms contains the critical components of specific drugs, parameters of needles, tubing and syringes and all other pertinent components for the safe and efficacious delivery of medications for all procedures.
 
The CompuFlo® technology also consists of a disposable injection handpiece that provides for precise tactile control during the injection, an electromechanical (computer-controlled) fluid delivery instrument and the ability to record data from the injection event. As confirmed by numerous noted medical and dental experts within academia and the clinical practice arenas, CompuFlo® has the potential to greatly increase the safety and efficacy of many drug delivery procedures that currently rely upon the over 150-year-old hypodermic syringe technology and the tactile senses and delivery expertise of the administrator.
 
On September 14, 2004, Milestone Scientific was issued United States Patent No. 6,786,885 for the CompuFlo® technology, entitled “Pressure/Force Computer Controlled Drug Delivery Instrument with Exit Pressure.” Proprietary software, working with an innovative technology, allows the instrument to continuously monitor and control the exit pressure of fluid and/or medication during an injection. This same technology also enables doctors to accurately identify different tissue types based on exit pressure during an injection. The technology has numerous applications in both medicine and dentistry, including epidural and intra-articular injections.
 
In December 2004, the United States Patent Office issued a “Notice of Allowance” for patent protection on two additional critical elements of the CompuFlo® automated drug delivery technology: “Drug Delivery Instrument with Profiles” and “Pressure/Force Computer Controlled Drug Delivery with Automated Charging”.
 
In December 2005, Milestone Scientific submitted a pre-market notification to the FDA on its CompuFlo® technology, which was subsequently cleared by the FDA in July of 2006. This initial submission was critical for Milestone Scientific’s continuing efforts to develop and commercialize this important technology. Milestone Scientific has identified a number of potential applications for CompuFlo®, including single-tooth dental injections, self-administered drug delivery, osteoarthritis joint pain management and epidurals. 
 
Given Milestone Scientific’s experience and established brand awareness within the dental industry, it elected to focus its initial product development efforts on the integration of CompuFlo® into its legacy computer-controlled dental injection instrument. As a result, Milestone Scientific developed the industry’s first solution for painlessly administering a single-tooth injection as the only injection necessary for achieving anesthesia, foregoing the need to administer a traditional nerve branch block. This instrument, which also utilizes a disposable handpiece, was trademarked the “STA Single Tooth Anesthesia System ®”.
 
 6


After receiving FDA 510(k) approval for the marketing and sale of the STA Instrument, Milestone Scientific introduced the instrument to market in February 2007 at the Chicago Dental Society’s 143rd Midwinter Meeting. The patented STA Instrument incorporates the "pressure feedback" elements of Milestone Scientific's patented CompuFlo® technology, thereby allowing dentists to administer injections accurately and painlessly into the periodontal ligament space, effectively anesthetizing a single tooth. This injection is of significant value in that it allows the dentist to profoundly anesthetize the tooth within one or two minutes, versus up to 15-18 minutes for a block injection to take effect. Utilizing the STA Instrument single tooth injection, the patient will suffer neither pain nor collateral anesthesia in the cheek, lips or tongue at any time. The STA Instrument is capable of performing all of the injections that can be done with a conventional dental syringe, including the palatal-anterior superior alveolar, anterior middle superior alveolar and inferior alveolar nerve block. The STA Instrument achieves these injections predictably and reliably. 
 
Initial market response to the STA Instrument following its commercial debut in February 2007 proved to be less than robust. Moreover, at that time, Milestone Scientific had granted exclusive United States and Canadian distribution and marketing rights for the STA Instrument to Henry Schein, Inc. (“Henry Schein”), the largest distributor of healthcare products and services to office-based practitioners in the combined North American and European markets. Following several months of lackluster sales and after making critical senior management changes, Milestone Scientific initiated an in-depth market study to reassess its positioning and marketing strategies for the STA Instrument. The insight gained from this study led management to redefine and implement a new messaging platform, created to emphasize key benefits that Milestone Scientific discovered are of most value to dental professionals. This new product messaging was launched in January 2008 and has remained in constant review.
 
In the spring of 2009, Milestone Scientific signed a distribution and marketing agreement with China National Medicines Corporation, dba Sinopharm, which is China's largest domestic manufacturer, distributor and marketer of pharmaceuticals and importer of medical devices and China's largest domestic distributor of dental anesthetic carpules to the Chinese dental industry. The distribution and marketing agreement with China National Medicines was terminated in September 2014. Proximate to that time, we entered into a new distribution and marketing agreement with Milestone China Ltd. ("Milestone China") to be our distributor for the STA Instruments and handpieces in China. Milestone Scientific owns forty (40%) percent of Milestone China. 
 
In early October 2012, the State Food and Drug Administration (“CFDA”) of the People’s Republic of China approved our STA Single Tooth Anesthesia System® Instrument.  However, the CFDA’s approval of the Wand® handpieces was received in May 2014 and the distribution of these handpieces in China began in the fourth quarter of 2014.
 
According to a 2011 report published by the U.S. Department of Commerce, titled “China’s Emerging Markets: Opportunities in the Dental and Dental Lab Industry,” China’s dental market lags behind other healthcare services and has largely been neglected in the past. In fact, a CS Market Research report indicates that 50% of adults and 70% of children out of China’s estimated 1.3 billion plus population have tooth decay problems and over 90% have periodontal disease. (See Shuyu Sun & Seth Pierrepont. The Dental Equipment Market Over in China, CS Market Research (Sept. 20, 2005) and Opportunities Abound for Dental Care in China, CHINA BRIEFING (February 27, 2015)). However, with increasing affluence of the Chinese population, as well as increasing attention towards personal care, demand for dental services has been growing. Market research firm Freedonia agrees, noting that demand for dental products in China is expected to climb due primarily to escalating personal income levels and government programs promoting awareness of the benefits of good oral care. 
 
Shortly before the end of the second quarter of 2009, Milestone Scientific elected to refine its international marketing strategy to gain greater access to and penetration of the international dental markets. The revised sales strategy provides for increasing hands-on oversight and support of its existing international distribution network, while also attracting new distributors throughout Europe, Asia and South America. 
 
 7


In November 2012, Milestone Scientific signed an exclusive distributor and marketing agreement with a well-known US domestic manufacturer and distributor, for the sale and distribution of the STA instrument and handpieces in the United States and Canada. The marketing initiative included participation in US and Canadian dental shows, as well as pediatric dental shows; an active advertising initiative targeting major dental publications; and direct mailing campaigns to over 150,000 dentists across the United States and Canada. The exclusive distributor and marketing agreement was converted to a non-exclusive agreement on December 31, 2016. 
 
In January of 2015, Milestone Scientific added a President, a full-time CEO for Wand Dental, a Senior Business Brand Manager, and a Senior Manager of Project Management. This increase in staffing was to support the growth of our initiative in our CompuFlo® software for anticipated new medical and dental instruments. 
 
In September 2016, Milestone Scientific added a senior Vice President of Marketing and Sales to focus on the medical sector of our business.
 
Beginning January 1, 2016, Milestone Scientific entered into a non-exclusive distribution agreement with Henry Schein. In June 2016, that agreement was replaced by a new agreement with Henry Schein providing for an exclusive distribution arrangement for our dental products in the United States and Canada. We believe that this exclusive arrangements will be more effective than previous arrangements relying on Wand Dental's appearances at dental shows and catalog sales. 
 
CompuFlo® Advanced Injection Technology – Core Technology
 
Our next significant intellectual property  was the development of our proprietary patented CompuFlo® technology for the precise delivery of anesthetics and other medicaments into various tissues and bodily cavities. The CompuFlo® technology has been FDA approved and allows the practitioner to precisely regulate and control the flow rate of the injectable material while receiving visual and audible in-tissue pressure feedback, allowing the practitioner to determine the tissue into which the injectable material is being delivered. The CompuFlo® technology encompasses the painless delivery benefits of the CompuDent® while allowing the practitioner to know which tissues have been penetrated and to inject medicaments precisely into the desired location. With CompuFlo®, the injection of chemotherapeutics and other toxic substances outside the targeted area can be avoided. The instruments developed using the CompuFlo® also provide a digital record of the time and amount of anesthetic or medicament injected. 
 
Our first system utilizing the CompuFlo® technology was our STA instrument and related handpiece for the dental market. The STA instrument and handpiece continue to provide all of the benefits of the CompuDent® system while better facilitating single tooth anesthesia (now generally performed with a high pressure spring loaded gun-like instrument) by allowing the practitioner to monitor and precisely control pressure, rate and volume. Instruments using the CompuFlo® technology can be used to inject a wide variety of liquid medicaments as well as anesthetics. We believe CompuFlo® avoids the negative side effects from the use of traditional hypodermic drug delivery injection instruments, which are well documented in dental and medical literature and include risk of death, transient or permanent paralysis, pain, tissue damage and post-operative complications. Pain and tissue damage often result from uncontrolled flow rates and pressure created during the administration of drug solutions into human tissue. While several technologies have been capable of controlling flow rate, we believe the ability to accurately and precisely control pressure has been unobtainable until the development of CompuFlo®. 
 
The next systems utilizing the CompuFlo® technology we developed were instruments for administering epidural injections and intra-articular related disposable and an instrument for administering hyaluronic acid and other medicaments into both major and minor joints for the alleviation of pain associated with arthritis and other deleterious joint conditions.
 
Our epidural injection instrument using CompuFlo® pressure sensing technology provides an objective tool that we believe consistently and accurately identifies the epidural space by detecting the difference in pressure between the ligamentum flavum and the extraligamentary tissue. In studies utilizing the CompuFlo® technology the epidural space has been correctly identified 100% of the time. Knowing the precise location of a needle during an epidural injection procedure provides a measure of safety not presently available to doctors using conventional syringes, in the absence of fluoroscopy, who identify the epidural space by relying on the subjective perception of loss of resistance to saline.

Precisely controlling in-tissue pressure increases patient safety by reducing the risk of tissue damage and post-treatment pain related to excessive pressure that may occur during certain injections. Identification of the tissue, in which the needle tip is imbedded, is believed to be highly important in epidural injections, intra-articular injections and numerous organ, subcutaneous and intramuscular injections. 
 
We believe that our intra-articular injection instrument will be particularly efficacious for arthritis patients who are obliged to endure multiple painful injections annually for a lifetime. Often these injections are not efficacious because the doctor using a syringe fails to locate the intra-articular space or does not inject the appropriate volume of hyaluronic acid or other medicament into that space. The CompuFlo® technology has been successful in administering hyaluronic acid and other medicaments into the intra-articular space in both small and large joints using its computer-controlled pressure sensing capabilities in an independent animal study.
 
Both the epidural and intra-articular instruments have obtained CE mark approval and may now be marketed and sold in most European countries and many other countries accepting CE approved instruments. In the United States, we have completed required testing for the epidural instrument for birthing and pain management and have submitted the favorable results of these tests to the FDA. We expect to receive FDA approval of our epidural instrument by the end of the second quarter 2017 and of our intra-articular instrument some time later in 2017; however we are unable to provide any assurances when approval will be received, if ever. Upon FDA approval, we intend to establish an international marketing network of independent distributors for the devices, although a limited number of European and near-east distributors have already been appointed. 
 
In December 2016, we received notification from the FDA that based upon the 510(k) application submitted for the Company's Compu-Flo Intra Articular Computer Controlled Injection System, we did not adequately document that the device met the equivalency standard required for 510(k) clearance. Following consultation with the FDA Office of Device Evaluation, we intend to provide additional data, which could include a new Human Factor Validation study (HFV Study) in support of a new 510(k) application for the device. An HFV Study demonstrates the ease of use of a product. The cost to generate this incremental data is estimated to be approximately $100,000. 
 
At earlier stages of development are potential products, using our CompuFlo® technology for less painful injections into the eye and for the subcutaneous injection of fillers and other substances in the dermatology market. In the self-injectable market there are a number of injectable drugs routinely self-administered in a home or office setting using spring loaded automatic injection devices by people who suffer from long term chronic conditions such as Multiple Sclerosis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, and other diseases of the auto immune system. We believe the CompuFlo® technology, using pressure sensing capabilities, can serve as a painless subcutaneous injection method for these self-administered drugs. A significant reduction in pain during delivery should have a positive impact on compliance, which is a major consideration when physicians are treating patients. In addition, the ability to record the injection will allow for significantly enhanced monitoring of the patient.
 
Instruments Platform-Medical and Dental
 
Milestone Scientific has developed and brought to market a highly differentiated portfolio of industry innovations. Milestone Scientific’s proprietary solutions have succeeded in elevating the innovation in the professional dental arena. The product portfolio includes:
 
STA Single Tooth Anesthesia System® Instrument
 
The STA Single Tooth Anesthesia System® Instrument (or STA Instrument) is a patented, computer-controlled local anesthesia delivery instrument that incorporates the “pressure feedback” elements of Milestone Scientific’s patented CompuFlo® technology, thereby allowing dentists to administer injections accurately into the periodontal ligament space, effectively anesthetizing a single tooth. While the periodontal ligament injection has been available for some time, there has been no effective technology that allows dentists to easily perform the procedure painlessly, safely and predictably until now. With this STA Instrument dentists can easily and predictably anesthetize a single tooth root in one minute as the primary and sole injection, as compared to a general blocking injection with a waiting time of up to 18 minutes (or longer if the blocking injection needs to be re-administered) before proceeding to perform a procedure on the targeted tooth. An instrument which allows dentists to effectively anesthetize a single tooth will greatly enhance the productivity of dental practices and, when combined with the painless injection capabilities already present in the CompuDent® instrument, such an instrument should provide a compelling value in the marketplace. The STA Instrument will generate recurring revenues from per-patient disposable handpieces.
 
 9


Since its market introduction in the spring of 2007, the STA Instrument has received favorable reviews and awards from the dental industry. In July 2007, noted industry publication Dentistry Today featured the STA Instrument as one of the “Top 100 Products in 2007,” helping to promote much broader recognition of the instrument and validating STA’s value proposition for dentists and patients, alike. In early 2008, Medical Device & Diagnostic Industry magazine distinguished the STA Instrument as a 2008 Medical Design Excellence Award winner in the “Dental Instruments, Equipment and Supplies” product category. Of the 33 products to receive this coveted award, the STA was one of only two winning products that serve dental practitioners. In December 2008, Milestone Scientific continued to win broad acclaim for the STA Instrument by winning a “Townie Choice Award”. The “Townie Choice” awards were originally started by Dr. Howard Darran and Farran Media, publisher of Dentaltown Magazine, to assist dentists in making product purchasing decisions, and are considered the “people’s choice” of the products and services available to the dental industry today. That same month, the STA Instrument was also named as a Dental Products Report “Top 100 2008 Product of Distinction.” Additionally, the STA Instrument was named one of Dentistry Today’s “Top 100 Products” for the third consecutive year in 2010.
 
CompuDent®
 
CompuDent® is Milestone Scientific’s proprietary, patented Computer-Controlled Local Anesthetic Delivery (C-CLAD) instrument and predecessor of the STA Instrument. CompuDent® delivers anesthesia at a precise and consistent rate below a patient’s pain threshold. Over the years, CompuDent® has been widely heralded as a revolutionary instrument, considered one of the major advances in dentistry in the 20th Century. The instrument has been favorably evaluated in more than 50 peer reviewed or independent clinical research reports. CompuDent®, including its ergonomically designed single-use handpieces (The Wand®), provides numerous, well documented benefits:
 

● | CompuDent® minimizes the pain associated with palatal, mandibular block and all other injections, resulting in a more comfortable injection experience for the patient;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the pencil grip used with The Wand® handpieces allows unprecedented tactile sense and accurate control;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | new injections made possible with the CompuDent® technology eliminate collateral numbness of the tongue, lips and facial muscles;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | bi-directional rotation of The Wand® handpieces eliminates needle deflection resulting in greater success and more rapid onset of anesthesia in mandibular block injections;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the use of a single patient use, disposable handpieces minimizes the risk of cross contamination; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The ergonomic design of The Wand® handpieces makes an injection easier and less stressful to administer, lowering the risk of carpal tunnel syndrome.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Despite CompuDent® many benefits, including the administration of less painful and more comfortable injections, dentists in the United States have been slow to give up the use of traditional syringes. Dentists have all been trained to use syringes in dental school and often have become accustomed to and are comfortable with their use during many years of clinical practice, in spite of the obvious reluctance and/or fear of the patient in relation to injections administered by hypodermic syringe. There are approximately 40 million dental phobics, those people afraid to visit a dentist, in the United States. Therefore, Milestone Scientific believes there is a disconnect in the way dentists perceive their patients’ attitudes toward injection by hypodermic syringe. The CompuDent® is used today by thousands of dentists around the world, many of whom have long since abandoned the over 150-year old syringe. 
 
 10


CompuMed®
 
CompuMed® is a patented computer-controlled injection instrument geared to the needs of the medical market and providing benefits similar to CompuDent®. CompuMed® allows many medical procedures, now requiring intravenous sedation, to be performed with only local anesthesia due to dramatic pain reduction. Also, dosages of local anesthetic can often be significantly reduced, thus reducing side effects, accelerating recovery times, lowering costs and eliminating potential complications. CompuMed® has accumulated clinical evidence demonstrating benefits from use in colorectal surgery; podiatry; dermatology, including surgery for the removal of basal cell carcinomas and other oncological dermatologic procedures; nasal and sinus surgery, including rhinoplasty; hair transplantation and cosmetic surgery, among others. The CompuMed® is being replaced by instruments that include CompuFlo® technology geared to specific medical disciplines.
 
The Wand®
  Our first commercial product, the CompuDent®, and its associated disposable The Wand® handpiece for the dental market is intended to allow the dentist to provide painless injections for virtually all dental procedures, including routine cleanings and fillings, as well as more sophisticated implants, root canals and crowns. New injections made possible by the CompuDent® eliminate collateral numbness of the tongue, lips and facial muscles and often hasten the onset of anesthesia by eliminating the need for mandibular blocks. The pencil grip used with The Wand® handpieces provides the practitioner with unprecedented tactile sense and accurate control and allows bi-directional rotation eliminating needle deflection, resulting in a greater success rate. Since the Wand® handpiece does not look like a typical syringe it also reduces patient anxiety and offers the possibility of curing dental phobia of which 40 million Americans suffer (see the Colgate Oral Care website). The CompuDent® instrument is considered one of the major advances in dentistry in the 20th Century and has been favorably evaluated in more than 50 peer reviewed or independent clinical research reports, which we have reviewed. 
Competition
 
Milestone Scientific’s proprietary, patented Computer-Controlled Local Anesthesia Delivery (C-CLAD) instruments compete with disposable and reusable syringes that generally sell at lower prices and that use established and well-understood methodologies in both the dental and medical marketplaces. Upon commercial introduction and sale, Milestone Medical’s epidural injection instrument will also compete with APAD, a computer controlled injection instrument which claims to be able to reliably identify the epidural space.
Milestone Scientific’s instruments compete on the basis of their performance characteristics and the benefits provided to the practitioner, patient and the dental business operations. Clinical studies have shown that the instruments reduce fear, pain and anxiety for many patients, and Milestone Scientific believes that they can reduce practitioner stress levels, as well. Milestone Scientific’s newest product introduction, the STA Instrument, can be used for all dental injections that can be performed with a traditional dental syringe. Moreover, the STA Instrument can also be used for new and modified dental injection techniques that cannot be performed with traditional syringes. These new techniques allow for faster procedures shortening chair-time, minimizing the numbing of the lips and facial muscles, enhancing practice productivity, reducing stress and virtually eliminating pain and anxiety for both the patient and the dentist.
 
Milestone Scientific faces intense competition from many companies in the medical and dental device industry, possessing substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel, and other resources. Most competitors have established reputations, stemming from their success in the development, sale, and service of competing dental products. Further, rapid technological change and research may affect the products. Current or new competitors could, at any time, introduce new or enhanced products with features that render the products less marketable or even obsolete. Therefore, Milestone Scientific must devote substantial efforts and financial resources to improve existing products, bring products to market quickly, and develop new products for related markets. In addition, the ability to compete successfully requires that Milestone Scientific establish an effective distribution network with a strong marketing plan. Historically, Milestone Scientific has been unsuccessful in executing the marketing plans for its products, primarily due to resource constraints. New products must be approved by regulatory authorities before they may be marketed. Milestone Scientific cannot assure that it can compete successfully, that competitors will not develop technologies or products that render the products less marketable or obsolete, or, that Milestone Scientific will succeed in improving the existing products, effectively develop new products, or obtain required regulatory approval for those products.

Milestone Scientific relies on a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark laws and employee and third party non-disclosure agreements to protect its intellectual property rights. Despite the precautions taken by Milestone Scientific to protect products, unauthorized parties may attempt to reverse engineer, copy, or obtain and use products and information that Milestone Scientific regards as proprietary, or may design products serving similar purposes that do not infringe on Milestone Scientific’s patents. Milestone Scientific’s failure to protect its proprietary information and the expenses of doing so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
In the event that Milestone Scientific’s products infringe upon patent or proprietary rights of others, we may be required to modify processes or to obtain licenses. There can be no assurance that Milestone Scientific would be able to do so in a timely manner, upon acceptable terms and conditions, or at all. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Government Regulation
 
The FDA cleared the CompuDent® instrument and its disposable handpieces for marketing in the United States for dental applications in July 1996; the CompuMed® instrument for marketing in the United States for medical applications in May 2001; and Safety Wand® for marketing in the United States for dental applications in September 2003. For us to commercialize other products in United States, Milestone Scientific would have to submit additional 510(k) applications to the FDA. Milestone Scientific received FDA 510(k) approval for the STA Instrument in August 2006.
 
The manufacture and sale of medical devices and other medical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA pursuant to the FDC Act, and by other federal, state and foreign authorities. Under the FDC Act, medical devices must receive FDA clearance before they can be marketed commercially in the United States Some medical products must undergo rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing and an extensive FDA approval process before they can be marketed. These processes can take a number of years and require the expenditure of substantial resources. The time required for completing such testing and obtaining such approvals is uncertain, and FDA clearance may never be obtained. Delays or rejections may be encountered based upon changes in FDA policy during the period of product development and FDA regulatory review of each product submitted. Similar delays also may be encountered in other countries. Following the enactment of the Medical Device Amendments to the FDC Act in May 1976, the FDA classified medical devices in commercial distribution into one of three classes. This classification is based on the controls necessary to reasonably ensure the safety and effectiveness of the medical devices. Class I devices are those devices whose safety and effectiveness can reasonably be ensured through general controls, such as adequate labeling, pre-market notification, and adherence to the FDA’s Quality Instrument Regulation (“QSR”), also referred to as “Good Manufacturing Practices” (“GMP”) regulations. Some Class I devices are further exempted from some of the general controls. Class II devices are those devices whose safety and effectiveness reasonably can be ensured through the use of special controls, such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries, and FDA guidelines. Class III devices are those which must receive pre-market approval by the FDA to ensure their safety and effectiveness. Generally, Class III devices are limited to life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices.
 
If a manufacturer or distributor can establish that a proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed Class I or Class II medical device or to a Class III medical device for which the FDA has not required pre-market approval, the manufacturer or distributor may seek FDA marketing clearance for the device by filing a 510(k) Pre-market Notification. The 510(k) Pre-market Notification and the claim of substantial equivalence may have to be supported by various types of data and materials, including test results indicating that the device is as safe and effective for its intended use as a legally marketed predicate device. Following submission of the 510(k) Pre-market Notification, the manufacturer or distributor may not place the device into commercial distribution until an order is issued by the FDA. By regulation, the FDA has no specific time limit by which it must respond to a 510(k) Pre-market Notification. At this time, the FDA typically responds to the submission of a 510(k) Pre-market Notification within 180 days. The FDA response may declare that the device is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed device and allow the proposed device to be marketed in the United States However, the FDA may determine that the proposed device is not substantially equivalent or may require further information, such as additional test data, before the FDA is able to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. Such determination or request for additional information could delay market introduction of products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If a device that has obtained 510(k) Pre-market Notification clearance is changed or modified in design, components, method of manufacture, or intended use, such that the safety or effectiveness of the device could be significantly affected, separate 510(k) Pre-market Notification clearance must be obtained before the modified device can be marketed in the United States. If a manufacturer or distributor cannot establish that a proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, the manufacturer or distributor will have to seek pre-market approval of the proposed device, a more difficult procedure requiring extensive data, including pre-clinical and human clinical trial data, as well as extensive literature to prove the safety and efficacy of the device.
 
Though the STA Instrument, CompuDent®, Safety Wand® and CompuMed® have received FDA marketing clearance, there can be no assurance that any of the other products under development will obtain the required regulatory clearance in a timely manner, or at all. If regulatory clearance of a product is granted, such clearance may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed. In addition, modifications may be made to the products to incorporate and enhance their functionality and performance based upon new data and design review. There can be no assurance that the FDA will not request additional information relating to product improvements; that any such improvements would not require further regulatory review, thereby delaying the testing, approval and commercialization of product improvements; or, that ultimately any such improvements will receive FDA clearance.

Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and will be monitored through periodic inspections by the FDA. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, manufacturer, or facility may result in restrictions on such product or manufacturer, including fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Milestone Scientific is subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, whose regulations require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain QSR requirements as defined by the FDC Act. QSR compliance requires testing, quality control and documentation procedures. Failure to comply with QSR requirements can result in the suspension or termination of production, product recall or fines and penalties. Products also must be manufactured in registered establishments. In addition, labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission. The export of devices is also subject to regulation in certain instances.
 
The Medical Device Reporting (“MDR”) regulation obligates us to provide information to the FDA on product malfunctions or injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of the product or in connection with certain product failures that could cause serious injury. If, as a result of FDA inspections, MDR reports or other information, the FDA believes that Milestone Scientific is not in compliance with the law, the FDA can institute proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations, or assess civil and/or criminal penalties against us, the officers or employees. Any action by the FDA could result in disruption of operations for an undetermined amount of time.
 
In March 2012, Milestone Scientific received approval for The Wand® and the STA Single Tooth Anesthesia System ® Instrument from ANVISA in Brazil. In June 2007, Milestone Scientific received a CE mark for the marketing of the STA Instrument in Europe. In June 2003 Milestone Scientific received a CE mark for the marketing of the Safety Wand® and The Wand® handpieces with needle in Europe. In July 2003, Milestone Scientific obtained regulatory approval to sell CompuDent® and its handpieces in Australia and New Zealand.
 
As of May 2014, China National Medicines received the appropriate registration approval from the regulatory body in China, therefore, shipment of STA handpieces began in China. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the distribution agreement with China National Medicines was terminated and Milestone China Ltd. (owned 40% by Milestone Scientific) became the authorized distributor of the STA instruments and handpieces in China.
 
Product Liability
 
Failure to use any of the products in accordance with recommended operating procedures could potentially result in health hazards or injury. Failures of the products to function properly could subject Milestone Scientific to claims of liability. Milestone Scientific maintains liability insurance in an amount that Milestone Scientific believes is adequate. However, there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage will be sufficient to pay product liability claims brought against Milestone Scientific. A partially or completely uninsured claim, if successful and of significant magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, Milestone had a total 17 full-time employees consisting of two executive officers of Milestone Scientific,  a director of clinical affairs, a director of engineering, a senior vice president of marketing, a senior project manager, three customer service representatives, two accountants, four clinical hygienist, a quality engineer, and an administrative manager. Milestone Scientific also has a consultant who serves as a Director of Clinical Affairs and a business development consultant.
