ITEM 1. Business
Overview
We provide a leading next-generation enterprise cloud operating system that converges traditional silos of server, virtualization, storage and networking into one integrated solution and unifies private and public cloud into a single software fabric. Our software delivers the agility, scalability and pay-as-you-grow economics of the public cloud, while addressing enterprise requirements of application mobility, security, data integrity and control. We provide our customers with the flexibility to selectively utilize the public cloud for suitable workloads and specific use cases by enabling increasing levels of application mobility across private and public clouds. This capability will enable hybrid cloud deployments and addresses a critical requirement for any next-generation enterprise cloud operating system. We have also recently announced additional capabilities that will enable native application orchestration and lifecycle management across multiple private and public cloud environments, as well as a native cloud-based disaster recovery service, which will further extend our hybrid cloud vision across the entire software stack. We have combined advanced web-scale technologies with elegant consumer-grade design to deliver a powerful enterprise cloud operating system that elevates IT organizations to focus on the applications and services that power their businesses. Our operating system is designed to create “invisible infrastructure” that provides constant availability and low-touch management, enables application mobility across computing environments and reduces inefficiencies in IT planning.
Our Enterprise Cloud Operating System
Our enterprise cloud operating system is based on powerful distributed systems architecture and converges server, virtualization, storage and networking resources into one integrated operating system. Generalist IT professionals are able to manage one datacenter operating system and management interface, which reduces administrative time and costs. Our solution is currently comprised of two comprehensive software product families, Acropolis and Prism. 

Acropolis. Acropolis includes our Distributed Storage Fabric that replaces traditional storage arrays and delivers efficient and high performance enterprise-grade data management across a range of storage protocols to support a wide variety of enterprise applications, and we have recently introduced the capability to operate both virtualized and non-virtualized applications. Acropolis also includes our innovative Application Mobility Fabric that will enable increasing levels of application placement, conversion and migration across different hypervisors and public clouds. Additionally, the built-in Acropolis Hypervisor can replace expensive third-party hypervisors and eliminate an additional infrastructure silo.
Prism. Built with consumer-grade design, Prism delivers integrated virtualization and infrastructure management, robust operational analytics, a search-first interface, self-service capabilities and one-click administration. Prism allows routine IT operations that are typically manual and cumbersome to be fully automated or completed with just one click, including capacity planning, provisioning of new applications and resources, troubleshooting and software upgrades. Prism also offers a self-service portal that enables developers and line-of-business owners to provision services as well as a broad set of APIs for integration with third-party cloud management and orchestration software.

Our Technology
Our enterprise cloud operating system converges server, virtualization, storage and networking into one software-driven integrated operating system that unifies private and public cloud into a single software fabric. Our operating system is designed to run on a variety of hardware platforms, including off-the-shelf x86 servers. Our solutions are easy-to-deploy and can be expanded one node at a time, reducing costs associated with overprovisioning. The product is a scalable distributed system and can be formed into very large clusters without any single point of failure or degradation of performance. Our solution is currently comprised of two comprehensive software product families, Acropolis and Prism.
Acropolis. Acropolis provides an open platform designed to address storage, application mobility and virtualization needs for a wide range of workloads that can be run at any scale. This platform offers IT professionals feature-rich turnkey infrastructure with increased flexibility of where to run their applications. Acropolis delivers enterprise-grade data management services, applied to individual virtual machines or applications to provide our customers with the granular infrastructure control they desire. Acropolis also provides scalable, efficient and secure platform services with built-in virtualization. Acropolis is comprised of three foundational components that can replace mid-range to high-end storage arrays and standalone virtualization products:

• | Acropolis Distributed Storage Fabric: Building on our Nutanix Distributed File System, the Acropolis Distributed Storage Fabric, or DSF, enables robust enterprise storage services across multiple storage protocols and hypervisors. Acropolis DSF provides file-based and block-based storage for both virtualized and non-virtualized environments. 


• | Acropolis Application Mobility Fabric: The Acropolis Application Mobility Fabric, or AMF, provides an open environment capable of delivering intelligent application placement and migration, as well as cross-hypervisor high availability and integrated disaster recovery. Acropolis supports all virtualized applications, and is intended to provide a seamless path to containers and hybrid cloud computing in the future. AMF allows migration from one hypervisor, such as VMware ESXi, to another hypervisor such as AHV. Acropolis DSF abstracts out the storage dependencies and AMF automates the workflows of the discrete steps of file format conversion, driver injection and VM provisioning. AMF also includes Cloud Connect, which offers extended hybrid cloud capabilities such as disaster recovery. 


• | Acropolis Hypervisor: Our built-in Acropolis Hypervisor, or AHV, is based on widely-used open source hypervisor technology known as Linux KVM, and is hardened with enterprise-grade security, self-healing capabilities and robust virtual machine, or VM, management. AHV is also integrated with Prism to deliver streamlined administrator workflows when provisioning, cloning and placing VMs. 

Prism. Prism offers a single point of management for server, virtualization, storage and networking resources and provides an end-to-end view of all common administrator workflows, system health, alerts and notifications through a simple, elegant and intuitive interface. Prism features innovative technology that streamlines time-consuming IT tasks, and includes one-click operation of software upgrades, detailed capacity analysis and troubleshooting.

The Prism homepage shows an overview of the cluster, system health and critical alerts:
Prism enables efficient management of enterprise-wide deployments by serving as a central administration point to manage multiple clusters and hypervisors (including VMware ESXi environments) within a datacenter or across multiple sites. Prism is built with HTML5 and can be accessed from any connected device that is HTML5-enabled, including smartphones and tablets. With innovative built-in machine intelligence technology, Prism provides capacity runway projections and capacity optimization recommendations to ensure just the right amount of resources are provisioned to support the applications running on the platform. Users can then precisely track infrastructure utilization across a distributed environment and add or remove nodes to any cluster in minutes. Prism is also built using a distributed, scale-out NoSQL database, meaning that software updates and patches can be executed non-disruptively on a rolling basis and do not require the cluster to be brought offline. Prism provides a suite of APIs for integration with third-party cloud management and orchestration systems, and allows developers and business users to provision infrastructure services without the need for intervention by IT. Often viewed as a key capability of any cloud platform, the Nutanix Self Service features built into Prism improve IT agility by radically simplifying application delivery and development while also heightening infrastructure automation.

Sales and Marketing
We primarily engage our end-customers through our global sales force who directly interact with key IT decision makers while also providing sales development, opportunity qualification and support to our channel partners. We have established relationships with many of the key resellers and distributors of datacenter infrastructure software and systems in each of the geographic regions where we operate.
We also engage our end-customers through our OEM partners Dell and Lenovo, which license our software and package it with their hardware into the Dell XC Series and Lenovo Converged HX Series appliances, respectively. Dell and Lenovo products incorporating our software are sold through their direct sales forces and channel partners. We also recently announced a partnership with IBM, which will license our software and package it with IBM Power Systems servers to create the IBM CS Series, which will be sold through IBM’s direct sales force and channel partners.
Our agreements with Dell, Lenovo and IBM provide that these partners pay us royalties for the distribution of our software together with their hardware and the sale of support and maintenance contracts for the integrated products. We provide training to their support personnel, and we also coordinate with them to collectively resolve support issues for end-customers. We have also agreed with Dell, Lenovo and IBM to invest in sufficient sales and marketing resources to support the launch and promotion of the integrated products, which, in the case of Lenovo, includes the commitment of dedicated sales personnel to support the sale of the integrated products. We work with each of Dell, Lenovo and IBM to ensure interoperability between our software and their hardware and to certify certain hardware configurations for use with our software.
 Our agreement with Lenovo expires in October 2018, and automatically renews for two successive one-year periods thereafter unless one party gives six months’ prior notice to the other party of its intent not to renew. Our agreement with Dell expires in June 2021, and automatically renews for successive one-year periods thereafter unless one party gives six months’ prior notice to the other party of its intent not to renew. Our agreement with IBM expires in July 2020, and automatically renews for successive one-year periods thereafter unless one party gives 180 days’ prior notice to the other party of its intent not to renew.
Our channel partners have joined our integrated partner program, the Nutanix Partner Network, which provides market development funds, preferred pricing through deal registration, sales enablement and product training, innovative marketing campaigns and dedicated account support. We also coordinate with Dell, Lenovo and IBM on joint marketing activities.
We supplement our sales efforts with our marketing program that includes print and online advertising, corporate and third-party events, demand generation activities, social media promotions, media and analyst relations and communities programs. For example, in June 2017 we hosted our third annual .NEXT Conference, where more than 3,500 attendees came to learn about our current and future products and solutions. We also establish deep integration with our ecosystem of third-party technology partners and engage in joint marketing activities with them.
Research and Development
Our research and development efforts are focused primarily on improving current technology, developing new technologies in current and adjacent markets and supporting existing end-customer deployments. Our research and development teams primarily consist of distributed systems software and user interface engineers. Most of our research and development team is based in San Jose, California. We also maintain research and development centers in Bangalore, India, Durham, North Carolina and Seattle, Washington. We plan to dedicate significant resources to our continued research and development efforts.
Research and development expense was $73.5 million, $116.4 million and $288.6 million for fiscal 2015, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, respectively.

Manufacturing
We outsource the assembly of our hardware products to two contract manufacturers, Super Micro Computer, Inc., or Super Micro, and Flextronics Systems Limited, or Flextronics. Super Micro and Flextronics assemble and test our products and they generally procure the components used in our products directly from third-party suppliers. Our agreement with Super Micro expires in May 2018, and automatically renews for successive one-year periods thereafter with the option to terminate upon each annual renewal. In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Flextronics pursuant to which we have transitioned and will continue to transition portions of our manufacturing operations to Flextronics, and we are currently working with Flextronics to finalize a manufacturing agreement. Distributors handle fulfillment and shipment for certain end-customers, but do not hold inventory.
Backlog
We typically accept and ship orders within a short time frame. In general, customers may cancel or reschedule orders without penalty, and delivery schedules requested by customers in their purchase orders vary based upon each customer’s particular needs. As a result, we do not believe that our backlog at any particular time is a reliable indicator of future revenue.
Competition
We operate in the intensely competitive enterprise infrastructure market and compete primarily with companies that sell software to build and operate enterprise clouds, integrated systems, and standalone storage and servers, as well as providers of public cloud infrastructure solutions. These markets are characterized by constant change and rapid innovation. Our main competitors fall into the following categories:

• | software providers, such as VMware, Inc., or VMware, and Red Hat, Inc., that offer a broad range of virtualization, infrastructure and management products to build and operate enterprise clouds;


• | traditional IT systems vendors such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, or HPE, Cisco Systems, Inc., or Cisco, Lenovo, Dell, Hitachi Data Systems, or Hitachi, and IBM, that offer integrated systems that include bundles of servers, storage and networking solutions, as well as a broad range of standalone server and storage products;


• | traditional storage array vendors, such as Dell, NetApp, Inc. and Hitachi, which typically sell centralized storage products; and


• | providers of public cloud infrastructure and services, such as Amazon.com, Inc., Google, and Microsoft Corporation.

In addition, we compete against vendors of hyperconverged infrastructure and software-defined storage products such as VMware, Cisco, HPE, Dell and many smaller emerging companies. As our market grows, we expect it will continue to attract new companies as well as existing larger vendors. Some of our competitors may expand their product offerings, acquire competing businesses, sell at lower prices, bundle with other products, provide closed technology platforms, or otherwise attempt to gain a competitive advantage.
We believe the principal competitive factors in the infrastructure software and systems market include:

• | product features and capabilities;


• | system scalability, performance and resiliency;


• | management and operations, including provisioning, analytics, automation and upgrades;


• | total cost of ownership over the lifetime of the technology;


• | product interoperability with third-party applications, infrastructure software, infrastructure systems and public clouds;


• | application mobility across disparate silos of enterprise computing, including public and private cloud infrastructure; and

7


• | complete customer experience, including support and professional services.

We believe we are positioned favorably against our competitors based on these factors. However, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, greater brand recognition, larger sales forces and marketing budgets, broader distribution, and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect and use our core technology and intellectual property. We rely on patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and employee nondisclosure and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. As of July 31, 2017, we had 48 United States patents that have been issued or allowed and 161 patent applications pending in the United States. Our issued patents expire between 2031 and 2037. We also integrate open source software into our products.
We control access to and use of our proprietary software and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright laws. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses and confidentiality agreements, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and technology. In addition, we sell extensively internationally, and effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.
Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We believe that competitors will try to develop products and services that are similar to ours and that may infringe our intellectual property rights. Our competitors or other third-parties may also claim that our operating system infringes their intellectual property rights. In particular, leading companies in our industry have extensive patent portfolios. From time to time, third-parties, including certain of these leading companies and non-practicing entities, may assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights against us, our channel partners, or our end-customers, which our standard license and other agreements obligate us to indemnify against such claims. Successful claims of infringement by a third-party could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services, require us to expend time and money to develop non-infringing solutions, or force us to pay substantial damages (including damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights), royalties or other fees. In addition, to the extent that we gain greater visibility and market exposure as a public company, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims from third parties. We cannot assure you that we do not currently infringe, or that we will not in the future infringe, upon any third-party patents or other proprietary rights. See “Risk Factors—Third-party claims that we are infringing intellectual property, whether successful or not, could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses, and our business could be harmed” for additional information.

Facilities
Our corporate headquarters are located in San Jose, California where, under two lease agreements that expire in March 2021, we currently lease approximately 176,000 square feet of space. We also maintain offices in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Latin America and Africa. We lease all of our facilities and do not own any real property. We expect to add facilities as we grow our employee base and expand geographically. We believe that our facilities are adequate to meet our needs for the immediate future, and that, should it be needed, suitable additional space will be available to accommodate expansion of our operations.
Employees
We had 2,813 employees worldwide as of July 31, 2017. None of our employees in the United States is represented by a labor organization or is a party to any collective bargaining arrangement. In certain of the European countries in which we operate, we are subject to, and comply with, local labor law requirements in relation to the establishment of works councils. We are often required to consult and seek the consent or advice of these works councils. We have never had a work stoppage and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
