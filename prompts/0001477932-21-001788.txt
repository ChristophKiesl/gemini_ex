Item 1. Description of Business
Introduction
 
Merion, Inc. is a provider of health and nutritional supplements and personal care products. Currently, we mainly sell our products over the Internet directly to end-user customers through our websites, www.dailynu.com and www.merionus.com, and to wholesale distributors through phone and electronic communication. Our major customers of our nutritional and beauty products are primarily located in the Asian market, predominantly in the People’s Republic of China. Our major customers of our Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) and packaging products are located in the United States (“U.S.”).
Company History
 
Merion, Inc., a Nevada corporation, was formed on February 4, 2011. Its predecessor, E-World USA Holding, Inc., was a California company incorporated in 2007 (“E-World CA”). In April 2011, E-World CA entered into a merger agreement with its wholly-owned subsidiary with the same name, E-World USA Holding, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“E-World NV”), that was the survivor of the merger and became the Company. Under the Merger Agreement, the Company issued 90,000,000 shares of its common stock on a one-for-one basis for each share of E-World CA’s common stock issued and outstanding at the date of the merger. In addition, the Company issued its Type A Warrants and Type B Warrants in exchange for comparable warrants issued and outstanding of E-World CA at the date of the merger. On June 27, 2017, the Company filed an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State for the State of Nevada to change its name effective immediately, from E-World NV, to Merion, Inc. 
Products
 
In June 2014, we suspended our direct marketing model in China in response to the legal action taken by the Chinese authorities. Since June 2014, we have sold our products primarily over the Internet directly to end-user customers and by phone/email orders directly to our wholesale distributors. Certain miscellaneous sales are made directly to customers who walk into the Company offices and customers who call the Company directly for products. We are now focusing on selling health and nutritional supplements and personal care products directly on the internet through our websites, www.dailynu.com and www.merionus.com. As of the date of filing of this report, we market ten individual nutritional supplement products, three and four of which were introduced in 2018 and 2019 respectively, and one beauty product, which was also introduced in 2018, on our websites. We are no longer selling similar products of third parties on our websites.
Company Products
 
Our nutritional supplement products are made according to a micro molecular nutrition formula. To achieve the maximum effect of products, micro molecular health foods were designed to be absorbed by cells directly with minimum chemical conversion, which we believe promotes faster absorption. We believe our Company is one of only a few companies in the market which are using a micro molecular nutrition formula.
 
In November and December 2016, our Dibeier Granules & Oral products successfully passed inspection by the Shenzhen Academy of Metrology & Quality Inspection and the Guangdong Quality Supervision and Inspection Institution for Food (Shenzhen). As a result, we were able to directly export these products to the China market and sell them at nutritional supplement stores in China as food, rather than only through our website. However, we have couple wholesale distributors selling other products and still exploring potential wholesale distributors in China to import these products. We are no longer selling Dibeier Granules & Oral products to individual customers in our website. 
 
In January 2018, we introduced a new beauty product, Noir Naturel, a gentle formula for grey coverage from the first application into hair. 
 
In September 2018, we introduced three different types of natural aphrodisiac supplements, Viwooba (1-3), for men that may support kidney health, improve immunity, enhance physical fitness, eliminate fatigue, improve sexual desire and enhance energy, strength and sexual ability.

In March 2019, we introduced 1) Lady-S, a female dietary supplement that may assist with weight loss, 2) Gold King, a nutritional supplement that may provide antioxidant support and liver health, 3) New Power, a nutritional supplement that may support heart health, and 4) Taibao, a nutritional supplement that may enhance physical performance and metabolism. 
 
In December 2019, we introduced Remage Power, a nutritional supplement that may provide anti-aging Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ support and promote energy & cell metabolism. 
 
The nutritional supplements’ and beauty products’ formulas do not have patent protection. 
 
Sales breakdown
 

 | 2020 | | | 2019
--------------------------------+------+----+---+-----
Nutritional and beauty products | | 16 | % | | 85 | %
OEM and packaging products | | 84 | % | | 15 | %



Currently, the Company does not have plans to expand its business beyond the nutritional products and beauty sector and the OEM and packaging sector.
 
All nutrition and beauty products are sold in China and all OEM and packaging products are sold in the U.S. 
 
Return and Refund Policy for Our Products
 
Merion guarantees the quality of its products, and will exchange any product found to be defective. Additionally, customers can apply for return and a 90% refund of the original purchase price of products purchased within 60 days. When products are returned, they must be unopened and resalable. All shipping fees for product exchanges or returns for refunds must be fully paid by customers. All of the returned products must not be damaged and must be within the valid shelf-life period specified on the product label. In addition to the Company’s 60-day return policy, the Company, at its discretion, may accept a customer’s application for a buy-back of products previously sold within one year at 90% of the original product costs less commissions and shipping costs.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no returns of products. 
 
Sourcing and Production
 
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we contracted for production of certain of our proprietary products from manufacturers that we believe are reliable, reputable and deliver high quality materials, products and services. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we also acquired our ingredients from suppliers for direct production in our Nevada factory. In 2020, one supplier accounted for approximately 71.8% of our purchases: Xi’an Yanhao Bio-tech Co.,Ltd. In 2019, three suppliers accounted for approximately 68.4% of our purchases: Forward Farma Inc. (35.5%), BioCaps Enterprise Inc. (17.5%), and Vyna Nutra Inc. (15.4%). The loss of one or more of these suppliers could have a negative impact on our sales and revenues if we cannot find a substitute quickly or upon favorable terms.
 
The Company does not have written or contractual agreements with its suppliers or third party manufacturers. Our product ingredient sourcing and other manufacturing requirements are conducted on a purchase-order basis. If one or more of our current suppliers stopped selling us ingredients and/or if one or more of our current manufacturers stopped manufacturing our products, we would be forced to find other suppliers and manufacturers. The time needed to find other suppliers or manufacturers could outlast the inventory on hand and result in loss of sales.
 
We maintain good relationships with our suppliers and do not anticipate that any of our suppliers will terminate such relationships in the near term. We also have ongoing relationships with secondary and tertiary suppliers. In the event that we become unable to source any products or ingredients from our major suppliers, we believe that we would be able to produce or replace those products or substitute source these ingredients from our secondary and tertiary suppliers without great difficulty or significant increases to our cost of goods sold.

In January 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with SUSS Technology Corporation, a Nevada corporation (the “Seller”), pursuant to which the Seller agreed to sell to the Company substantially all of the assets associated with the manufacture of dietary supplements (the “Asset Sale”) for an aggregate purchase price (the “Purchase Price”) of $1,000,000 and 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Purchase Shares”). The Seller was one of our major suppliers during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Having purchased these assets from the Seller, we have begun manufacturing some of the nutritional supplements that we sell. These assets meet all industry nutritional and dietary supplements manufacturing standards, including FDA and GMP compliance and cGMP regulations. In addition to manufacturing the nutritional supplements that we sell, we also have started production of hard capsules, tablets, solid beverage (sachet packaging), teabags, powder, granules, dietary supplements for export, softgel capsules and healthy food from these assets for any potential new customers who need such products.
 
For nutritional products and beauty products, we purchase our ingredients from third parties and contract with third-party manufacturers or use our own manufacturing facility in Nevada for further processing of the raw materials into final products to be sold. Prior to January 1, 2018, we did not own a manufacturing plant for product processing and all manufacturing was conducted by third parties. 
 
We also maintain good relationships with our manufacturers and do not anticipate that any of our manufacturers will terminate such relationships in the near term. In the event we become unable have our products produced by our major manufacturers, we believe that we would be able to reallocate production to our other manufacturers or locate other manufacturers without great difficulty or significant increases to our cost of goods sold.
 
In addition, we maintain good relationships with our wholesale distributors in China and our OEM and packing customers in the U.S. and do not anticipate that any of those parties will terminate such relationships in the near term. In 2020, one customer accounted for approximately 56.2% of our sales. In 2019, one customer accounted for approximately 9.7% of our sales. The loss of one or more customers could result in a potential loss of sales and have a negative effect on our operations if we cannot find one or more substitutes.
 
Order Backlog
 
We have no current order backlog.
 
Industry Analysis
 
The nutrition industry includes many small and medium sized companies that manufacture and distribute products generally intended to enhance the body’s performance and wellness. The three major product categories within the nutrition industry are:

· | Nutritional Supplements – products such as vitamins, minerals, nutritional supplements, herbs and botanicals and compounds derived from these substances.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Natural and Organic Foods – products such as cereals, milk, non-diary beverages and frozen entrees. 
· | Functional Foods – products with added ingredients or fortification specifically for health or performance purposes. 



The nutritional supplement market is characterized by:
 

· | Large selections of essentially similar products that are difficult to differentiate. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Retail consumers’ emphasis on value pricing. 
· | Constantly changing formulations based on evolving scientific research. 
· | Low entry barriers resulting from low brand loyalty, rapid change, widely available manufacturing, low regulatory requirements and ready access to large distribution channels, such as the Internet and retail stores selling nutritional supplements and other direct marketing companies.
· | A lack of uniform standards regarding product ingredient sources, potency, purity, absorption rate and form.

Competition
 
The market for nutritional products is large and intensely competitive. The Company competes directly with companies that manufacture and market nutritional products. The Company competes with other companies in the nutritional products industry by emphasizing the uniqueness, value and premium quality of the Company’s products and convenience of the Company’s Internet sales system. Many of the Company’s competitors have much greater name recognition and financial resources than the Company. In addition, nutritional products can be purchased in a wide variety of channels of distribution. While the Company believes that consumers appreciate the convenience of ordering products from home through the Internet, the buying habits of many consumers accustomed to purchasing products through traditional retail channels are difficult to change. The Company’s product offerings are also relatively small compared to the wide variety of products offered by many other nutritional product companies.
Marketing Plan
 
The Company signed a new lease agreement effective March 1, 2020 to open a New York office to expand its business in the New York market. The office will be used as the training center for market development. The Company will focus on promoting its product (ReMage Power) in the New York market. ReMage Power is a nutritional supplement which provides anti-aging Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ support and promotes energy and cell metabolism. However, due to the surge of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases throughout the United States, we have not utilized the training center since the beginning of the lease. In January 2021, the U.S. federal government began rolling out the COVID-19 vaccinations and we expect to start using the training center in the summer of 2021 once the majority of the U.S. population is immunized. 
 
The Company is developing a new sales channel through Youbo which works as a live-streaming platform fully integrated into the WeChat app. Although this is a new live-steaming platform, Youbo has 3 million registered users within the first two months of its operation since 2019. The Company will promote its products through this new platform. 
 
The Company also promotes its products through its websites. 
 
A majority of the Company’s sales on nutritional and beauty products were generated from China for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
 
Since June 2014, we have mainly sold our products over the Internet directly to end-user customers through our websites, www.dailynu.com and www.merionus.com, and to wholesale distributors. In March 2016, we launched an Affiliate Marketing Program, which has not been active since January 2017. The Company reactivated such program in January 2020. Members who successfully register with the affiliate program can earn up to a 70% commission from total sales amounts that achieved through their unique links assigned by the Company. However, no commissions were earned from the Members after the re-activation of such program in January 2020. We deactivated this program in November 2020. 
 
We believe that consumers have become more confident in ordering products like ours over the Internet. However, the nutritional supplement and skin care product e-commerce markets have been, and continue to be, increasingly competitive, and are rapidly evolving. 
 
The Company’s marketing efforts also include the Company CEO’s network and relationships to approach customers and distributors to purchase the Company’s products in fiscal years 2020 and 2019.

Share Distribution Plans
 
On June 30, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the grant of up to twenty million shares (from authorized but unissued shares of the Company’s common stock) to persons outside the U.S. who sell Company products, based on their sales performance in the future. The Company must determine that this type of incentive compensation is legal and appropriate for each country in which it is utilized. For ease of administration, this plan has been, and will continue to be, implemented solely for persons outside of the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933.
 
As of December 31, 2020, the Company has already issued 64,500 shares to the Company’s sales agents outside the U.S. and such shares were issued in 2018. 
 
Intellectual Property
 
We have no registered trademarks or patents in the United States. We have common law ownership rights under U.S. trade secret law for the formulations for eleven of our twelve Nutritional Supplements (all except O2 Cell Power). We also have common law ownership rights for the formulation of our Noir Naturel product.
 
The formulation of the O2 Cell Power product is owned by Oxygen America, Inc., which manufactures this product and packages it with Company designed packaging under an oral agreement with us. We are authorized by this supplier under oral agreement to sell this product worldwide under our brand name without infringing on any rights of Oxygen America, Inc.
 
The Company has obtained a Trademark Registration in China for the name of “Dibeier” (or Mandarin pinyin: “Nuo Lin”) with trademark application number 20669799 in September 2017. Under Chinese law, this trademark may be renewed every 10 years and can be valid for an indefinite period subject to timely renewal. 
 
The Company also has obtained a Trademark Registration in China for the name of “DailyNu” with trademark application number 20683305 in September 2017. Under Chinese law, this trademark may be renewed every 10 years and can be valid for an indefinite period subject to timely renewal.
 
Other than the aforementioned trademarks, we do not own any other registered trademarks, trade names or other governmentally approved intellectual property rights for those products.
 
Research and Development
 
In 2018, we made efforts to internally develop an online platform called “E-Hospital”. We anticipated that E-Hospital would provide the latest and the most advanced U.S. health care information and products, including legally exported nutrition supplements and newly-released medication for local hospitals and other medical institutes in China through the Internet. We contacted doctors who would be partnering with our E-Hospital platform to provide periodic video consultation and overseas medical lectures to promote the exchange of medical information and developments. The collaboration of E-Hospital with overseas local hospitals could strengthen the recognition, popularity and reputation of overseas local hospitals, as well as expand the market share and increase the competitiveness of these hospitals. 
 
We expect that the E-Hospital Services will eventually provide the following benefits:
 

· | High quality remote treatment anywhere, to suit individual lifestyles; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Coordinate medication delivered directly to patients; 
· | Facilitate access to the latest US medical treatments; 
· | Provide an internet forum for communication and sharing between doctors and doctors, doctors and patients, or patient to patient; and 
· | Facilitate access to safe and high quality nutritional supplements, which are becoming increasingly difficult to obtain in polluted countries such as China.

Under our plan, the E-Hospital Services will also include the following:
 

· | Facilitate access to effective advanced medication, therapeutic nutritional supplements and health products; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Facilitate access to cutting-edge medical health knowledge; 
· | Coordinate prescriptions, legally issued by all E-Hospital affiliated doctors; 
· | Feature services and new medications promoted by our local hospital partners; 
· | Provide access to live video consultations with U.S. doctors, medical lectures, and product shipping and customer service.



The Company has put the E-Hospital project on hold in 2019 and 2020 due to the lack of funding to develop the online system and negative impact by COVID-19. The Company plans to resume the construction of the system as soon as we secure the funding for this project. 
 
Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $0 and $904, respectively. 
 
Government Regulation
 
Given uncertainties relating to our compliance with personal network marketing laws in foreign jurisdictions, the Company discontinued sales through the network marketing model in 2014, and began selling directly to end-user customers from our website. 
 
We believe we are no longer subject to personal network marketing regulations since we discontinued sales through the network marketing model in 2014. Nonetheless, we are still subject to federal, state, local and foreign regulations. Various governmental agencies have an impact on our business, including but not limited to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Regulations promulgated by the FDA and other government agencies cover product ingredients, manufacturing, distribution, marketing, sales, compensation and taxation, to name a few. All of our products have certificates of free sales issued by the FDA Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. If the Company were to fail to meet standards required by these regulations, then the Company could be prohibited from selling its products.
 
The Company plans to export its Dibeier Products into China to be sold over-the-counter in retail locations such as nutritional product stores, rather than only through our websites. Under Chinese law, to import these products into China, the Company must provide the Inspection Report from the Provincial Quality Supervision and Inspection Institution. In November and December 2016, our Dibeier Granules & Oral products successfully passed inspection by the Shenzhen Academy of Metrology & Quality Inspection and the Guangdong Quality Supervision and Inspection Institution for Food (Shenzhen). The Company also obtained the Product Chinese Name registration from local SAMR and the trademark registration in September 2016 from the Trademark Office of State Administration for Market Regulation (“SAMR”), formerly known as State Administration for Industry & Commerce of China. 
 
Human Capital Resources
 
We understand that our success depends on our ability to attract, train and retain our employees. We strive to attract, recruit, and retain employees through competitive compensation and benefit programs, learning and development opportunities that support career growth and advancement opportunities, and employee engagement initiatives that foster a strong Company culture. In addition to cash compensation, we offer customary benefits in accordance with local regulatory requirements as well as performance-based stock options to our employees. We also recognize the importance of keeping our employees safe. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees and have followed local government orders to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
Employees
 
We have the following employees as of December 31, 2020:
 

· | Full time: 8 
--+-------------------
· | Operations – 4 
· | Administrative – 2
· | Management – 1 
· | Sales – 1 



We have no collective bargaining agreement with our employees. We consider our relationships with our employees to be excellent.
