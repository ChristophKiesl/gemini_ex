Item 1. Business
Overview
Workiva provides enterprises with cloud solutions for improving productivity, accountability and insight into business data. Workiva created Wdesk, a collaborative work management platform for organizations to collect, link, report and analyze their business data. Wdesk’s proprietary word processing, spreadsheet and presentation applications are integrated and built upon a data management engine, offering synchronized data, controlled collaboration, granular permissions and a full audit trail. Wdesk helps mitigate risk, improves productivity and gives users confidence to make decisions with real-time data. As of December 31, 2016, we provided our platform to more than 2,700 organizations, including more than 70% of Fortune 500 companies. 
Enterprises often struggle to manage, report, analyze and understand their ever-expanding volume of data. Many organizations are required to report an increasing amount of disparate information to a variety of regulators, boards and other stakeholders, straining organizations’ ability to produce consistent data and reports. Legacy processes and disconnected technologies are inefficient at helping users find, understand and report the most critical and relevant information on a timely basis. Organizations often rely on manual processes, large teams, third-party consultants and a variety of point solutions, such as business productivity software, email and general-purpose collaboration software. Exacerbating these challenges is the continued growth in size and complexity of many enterprises, with employees and data spread around the world. The stakes for enterprises are high; reporting incorrect, incomplete or untimely information increases the risks of poor decision-making, legal liability, reputational damage and a weakened competitive position.
Wdesk addresses these challenges, and we believe our platform is changing the way people work. Our scalable, enterprise-grade data engine enables users to collect, aggregate and manage their unstructured and structured data in Wdesk. With Wdesk serving as a single system of record for critical business data, our customers can have more time to perform value-added work by eliminating repetitive, manual and time-consuming tasks imposed by legacy software. Furthermore, the technology features people have come to expect as consumers – speed, access and sharing – are available at work with Wdesk, thereby enabling our customers to become more efficient and flexible, which we believe leads to greater job satisfaction, employee retention and career mobility. 
Wdesk enables coworkers to create, review and publish data-linked documents and reports with greater control, accuracy and productivity than ever before. Wdesk is flexible and scalable, so users can easily adapt it to define, automate and change their business processes in real time, which helps our users increase efficiency by streamlining and modernizing legacy processes and methods. 
With Wdesk data linking, changes are automatically updated in all linked instances – including numbers, text, charts and graphics – throughout a customer’s spreadsheets, word-processing documents and presentation decks in the Wdesk platform. Linking ensures that collaborators are working with the most current data, which reduces operational costs related to tedious ticking and tying and gives our customers peace of mind that their data and reports are accurate.
Wdesk provides accountability and transparency through a detailed audit trail that tracks every change made by every user over time. A complete record of data provenance and all changes helps our customers mitigate risk, gain insights and make better, data-driven decisions.
With Wdesk permission controls, administrators can control access at all levels, down to an individual data point, for each user to create, review and edit data and documents that relate directly to them. This control feature also enables users to grant access to their external auditors, outside counsel and other consultants, which streamlines the review process and reduces expenses. 
Wdesk’s Evidence Management allows users, including internal audit and Sarbanes Oxley Act (SOX) compliance teams, to digitally embed and annotate evidence in work papers with a complete audit trail, which helps our customers better identify, assess and mitigate risks. Similarly, finance and accounting teams use Wdesk’s Digital Support Binders to attach and annotate a variety of substantiating documents when reporting to boards of directors, auditors and regulators who require proof of data in annual and quarterly reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
Wdesk allows users to work anytime from anywhere with an internet connection, enabling them to:

• | Create trusted datasets that are linked and aggregated throughout Wdesk documents, spreadsheets, presentations and reports.


• | Control access to datasets, reports and workflows throughout the organization and with external stakeholders.


• | Collaborate among thousands of users working in real time on a secure, cloud-based platform.


• | Streamline and automate business processes, saving time and resources.


• | Present critical data and reports to internal and external constituents.


• | Gain insights with improved transparency of data provenance and collaborators’ changes.


• | Decide with confidence based on trusted data and reports.

Wdesk Technology
Our technology is enterprise grade and developed to perform at scale. Wdesk utilizes Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services, which enable us to scale our compute and storage capacity on an as-needed basis. We can deploy incremental changes to our customers on a daily basis by employing a continuous delivery process supported by Agile software development methodologies and a proprietary quality assurance process. As a result, all of our customers access the latest version of our platform, and upgrades are applied with minimal disruption to ongoing operations. In addition, in order to keep our customers’ data secure, we have developed advanced data security protocols that augment the standard security of the Google and Amazon cloud services. Our architecture has scalability for global enterprises, as well as advantages in reliability and cloud delivery.
Platform Milestones 
In March 2010, we released our first software solution, which focused on streamlining reporting to the SEC. SEC filings, such as Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and proxy statements, are lengthy and complex documents that require significant collaboration across multiple business functions and external constituents, including auditors and lawyers. Our SEC solution enables customers to automate and improve their regulatory filing process. 
In March 2013, we launched our Wdesk collaborative work management platform to respond to the growing demand from our customers to use Wdesk for work beyond SEC reporting. We have continued to add solutions to the Wdesk platform over time by identifying markets where Wdesk can address a wide range of critical business challenges for our customers. We employ a rigorous process to validate and prioritize 
new markets based on the number of customers that could benefit from a new solution and our assessment of Wdesk’s ability to address that challenge.
In 2016, we enhanced our Wdesk Data Platform, which powers one of the largest and fastest spreadsheet applications in the cloud and improves data relationships for SOX and internal control teams. Our Data Platform offers dynamic dashboards, automates reporting, and supports advanced testing workflow.

The efficiency of our Wdesk platform allows us to continue to leverage new products into adjacent markets. In addition, Wdesk is flexible and scalable in a way that allows our customers to continually find new uses for Wdesk.
Sales and Marketing
Our “land-and-expand” sales strategy focuses on acquiring new customers and building our existing customer relationships by using a direct-sales model. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we began to augment our direct-sales channel with partnerships. Over time, we expect our partners to include technology companies, consultants, service providers and accounting firms. We expect our partners to support our sales efforts through referrals and co-selling arrangements, as well as expand the use of Wdesk through integrated technology offerings.
Our customer success and professional services teams help our account managers build our existing customer relationships by providing advice and best practices that enable users to harness the full power of Wdesk. We believe our sales strategies position us to build relationships over time as we add new users and solutions and expand to additional markets and geographies. 
Many of the largest and most demanding enterprises in the world are our customers. We have a broadly diversified customer base; our largest customer represented less than 1% of our revenue in 2016. We believe that we have exceptional customer satisfaction, as evidenced by our subscription and support revenue retention rate of 95.4% (excluding add-on seats) as of December 2016. Our subscription and support revenue retention rate including add-ons was 107.4% at the December 2016 measurement date.
We have experienced high revenue growth since the release of our first solution in March 2010. Our revenue increased from $14.9 million in 2011 to $178.6 million in 2016, representing a 64% compound annual growth rate. We incurred a net loss of $41.2 million in 2014, $43.4 million in 2015 and $44.0 million in 2016. Approximately 80% of our revenue in 2016 was derived from subscription and support fees, with the remainder from professional services. 
Our Industry
Key Industry Trends are Driving a Fundamental Shift in How Enterprises Collect, Manage, Report and Analyze Critical Business Data.
Data is Disparate. Enterprise data is typically spread across hundreds of different sources and stored in incompatible formats. While many enterprises maintain data in a structured enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, International Data Corporation estimates that more than 90% of the data businesses create is “unstructured,” which is defined as unorganized data that resides outside the realm of ERP. Organizations often struggle with creating efficient and trusted solutions to harnesses this data in ways that can support decision-making.
Changing Regulatory Requirements. Legislation, such as SOX and the Dodd-Frank Act, continues to drive complex reporting mandates. SOX requires public company CEOs and CFOs to individually certify that their annual and quarterly financial reports are accurate and complete and to assess the effectiveness of their internal controls over financial reporting. Increased scrutiny from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) on audits of management’s assessment of internal controls – and the transition in the framework used for assessing internal controls – is driving public companies to find more efficient and accurate solutions for SOX compliance.
Governmental agencies charged with implementing these legislative mandates and others, such as the SEC, the Canadian Securities Administrators, the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, continue to issue and change regulations that affect existing reporting requirements. Regulators are also implementing new, industry-specific reporting requirements. For example, in recent years insurance companies have been required to produce reports for Own Risk Solvency Assessment (ORSA) and Model Audit Rule, often referred to as MAR-SOX because of its similarity to SOX compliance. 
XBRL Use is Growing. Regulators are demanding greater standardization and structure in the data that companies report. For example, the SEC requires that public companies include “interactive financial data” in filed annual and quarterly reports so that an investor can immediately extract the data and compare it to performance in past years, information from other companies and industry averages. The SEC implemented its interactive data mandate by requiring companies to tag the financial data in their filings using XBRL, which is a royalty-free, international format designed specifically for business information. XBRL provides a unique, electronically readable tag for each individual disclosure 
item within business reports. In June 2016, the SEC began allowing public companies to submit financial statements using Inline XBRL, a format that embeds XBRL in the financial statements, thus eliminating the need to file two documents. Use of XBRL enables government agencies to automate screening and analysis of filed documents. For example, the SEC Division of Enforcement has integrated the analysis of XBRL data into its investigative processes.
We expect the use of XBRL in the United States to continue to grow. For example, the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act), which had broad bipartisan support, mandates that in 2017 federal agencies report spending information to the U.S. Department of Treasury (Treasury) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) using a non-proprietary data standard. Treasury and OMB have designated XBRL as the data standard to be used for such reporting. In addition, Treasury and OMB are required to decide in 2018 whether to require recipients of federal contracts and grants to submit reports to the agencies using XBRL. We also expect the use of XBRL to grow outside the United States, as securities regulators, stock exchanges and taxing authorities in several countries (such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, South Korea, Spain and the United Kingdom) already collect XBRL data. The European Securities and Market Authority (ESMA) announced in December 2016 that beginning on January 1, 2020, issuers in the European Union must report their company information to national securities regulators using Inline XBRL. 
Increasing Management Oversight. Enterprises are under increasing pressure to report a growing amount of information to internal management teams, boards of directors, internal and external auditors, and other stakeholders. We believe that data needs to be collected, reported and analyzed more rapidly than ever before. Management teams are increasingly focused on leveraging data to support critical decisions. At the same time, boards of directors are pressing organizations to improve transparency in order to better fulfill their fiduciary duties.
Structural Shifts in Workforce Organization. Market dynamics and the globalization of enterprises have changed the way people work together. Organizations are becoming increasingly global, with employees geographically distributed to support strategic and business needs. Workforce flexibility initiatives have resulted in more employees working remotely. 
Consumerization of Enterprise IT. Technical advancements in smart phones and tablets have enabled the proliferation of mobile devices across the enterprise. Enterprise cloud-based solutions are becoming increasingly common and are enabling employees to work from anywhere with an internet connection, often from a mobile device. The rapid advancement of consumer applications, particularly social media, have raised expectations for enterprise technology as employees expect their workplace technology to achieve the same level of functionality, performance and ease of use as the consumer technology that permeates their daily lives.
Legacy Business Processes and Solutions Are Insufficient for the Requirements of Modern Enterprises.
For many enterprises, the process of compiling, reporting and analyzing critical data has been manual, repetitive and error-prone. Large enterprises often employ hundreds or even thousands of people to manually collect data and to create and update rolling versions of draft documents and underlying spreadsheets using legacy business productivity software and niche, point solutions.  Modern enterprises require a level of real-time collaboration, security and control that we believe outdated business productivity software and point solutions do not deliver. Shortcomings of legacy business processes and solutions include the following: 
Access to resources is restricted. Traditional solutions require employees to be physically present at, or remotely logged into, a machine with the required technology and access permissions. Enterprise remote networks can be plagued by connection and performance challenges. These impediments restrict 
productivity as employees attempt to complete work at home and while traveling and often lead to unapproved workarounds that may expose sensitive data. 
Collaboration is inefficient and risky. Traditional office software requires one person to work on one version of a presentation or report at one time. This rigidity creates challenges as concurrent versions lead to a tedious and time-consuming reconciliation process. Collaboration requires opening and closing, saving and sending, and communicating outside the document rather than inside the document, all of which adds time to document creation and risk to document integrity. 
Workflows are rigid and serial. Workflows for presentation and report production operate as a series of dependent events, with workers being unable to advance sections they are responsible for while waiting for their turn in the document-production process. Any section completed out of order risks data integrity and has the potential to lengthen – rather than reduce – production timelines. Unanticipated events at any step in the workflow may slow down the entire process.
Dataset creation is highly manual. Traditional dataset creation relies on ad-hoc processes and loosely defined protocols to consolidate a patchwork of disparate data sources with different owners and storage locations across the enterprise. Enterprise databases are typically controlled by IT personnel, requiring additional resources and time to query, access and manipulate data. Compiling the same dataset in future periods often requires the same amount of time as the initial effort as enterprises are unable to leverage prior work to roll forward datasets.
Edits are error prone and lack audit trails. Traditional software does not permit linking references to a single source, so when a change is made it does not flow throughout the document or related documents. The integrity of a group of related presentations and reports is at risk every time a number is edited, and worker productivity is lost in a cycle of implementing edits and reviewing for errors. Traditional solutions do not offer visibility into data provenance or the lineage of changes to a document. Audit trails often consist of unsatisfactory solutions, such as tracked changes, which can be turned off; in-line comments, which are cumbersome to manage; and rolling versions, which lead to inefficient workflows and reconciliation.
Control is limited. With legacy software, multiple versions of a spreadsheet, presentation or report may be stored in numerous locations across an enterprise, making it difficult to control who can review and edit, and even more difficult to adjust these roles as the creation process evolves. 
The Workiva Solution
We believe that we change the way enterprises and their employees work by enabling users to modernize risky and inefficient business processes with our Wdesk collaborative work management platform. 
Integrated Platform of Business Applications Built on a Data Management Engine. Wdesk’s proprietary word processing, spreadsheet and presentation applications are integrated and built upon a data management engine, offering synchronized data, controlled collaboration, granular permissions and a full audit trail. 
Controlled Collaboration. Our familiar, intuitive platform enables co-workers to collaborate within the same Wdesk document, spreadsheet, presentation or report at the same time from any location with internet access. 
Data Consistency. With Wdesk data linking, any change is automatically updated in all linked instances – including numbers, text, charts and graphics – throughout a customer’s spreadsheets, word-processing documents and presentation decks in the Wdesk platform. Linking enables customers to trust their data, which reduces operational costs related to tedious ticking and tying.
Version Control. Wdesk enables coworkers to create, review and publish data-linked documents and reports in a single, secure cloud platform. Wdesk ensures that collaborators are working on the most current and accurate version and eliminates numerous, often conflicting versions of documents and emails that can be problematic with outdated legacy software.
Flexible Data Management. Our scalable, enterprise-grade data engine enables users to collect, aggregate and manage their unstructured and structured data in Wdesk. With Wdesk serving as a single system of record for critical business data, our customers can have more time to perform value-added work by eliminating repetitive, manual administrative tasks imposed by archaic, legacy software.
Permissions and Security. With Wdesk permissions features, administrators can control access at all levels, down to an individual data point, for each user to create, edit, comment and review data and documents that relate directly to them. This control feature also enables users to grant access to their external auditors, outside counsel and other consultants, which streamlines the review process and reduces expenses. 
Full Audit Trail. Wdesk provides accountability and transparency through a detailed audit trail that tracks every change made by every user over time. A complete record of data provenance and all changes helps our customers mitigate risk, gain insights and make better, data-driven decisions.
Tasking, Workflow and Certifications. Users can assign and respond to tasks as well as request, review and approve documentation within Wdesk. A configurable, step-by-step workflow function helps team members and approvers streamline their processes. Our platform also provides a certification function that allows any Wdesk viewer to attest to the accuracy and completeness of documents and reports and allows administrators to monitor the process with customizable dashboards. 
Digital Paper Trail. Internal audit and SOX compliance teams use Wdesk’s Evidence Management feature to digitally embed and annotate evidence in work papers with a complete audit trail, which helps our customers better identify, assess and mitigate risks. Similarly, finance and accounting teams use Wdesk Digital Support Binders to attach and annotate a variety of substantiating documents to their financial reports when reporting to boards of directors, auditors and regulators who require proof of data in annual and quarterly reports to the SEC. 
Consumer Product Features at Work. The technology features people have come to expect in their personal lives – speed, access and sharing – are available at work with Wdesk in a familiar interface, which we believe improves productivity and increases employee satisfaction.
Trusted Ecosystem for Critical Business Data. Our platform captures a complete history of a document’s lineage, from the most granular edit to a spreadsheet cell formula to key document milestones. At the same time, Wdesk gives document owners the ability to manage document permissions down to a single section of a document. The ability to control access and user permissions with this level of granularity enables document owners to respond to evolutions in team composition and collaboration requirements. Ultimately, the robust audit and access control capabilities create transparency, accountability, integrity and confidence in the data creation and report generation workflows.
Enterprise Grade and Built for Scale. Our cloud platform allows our customers to implement and rapidly scale users and solutions within days, without the need to install and maintain costly infrastructure hardware and software necessary for on-premise deployments.
Secure Architecture. In addition to the physical, operational and infrastructure security protections provided by our technology partners, Google and Amazon, we work to protect our customers’ data using enterprise-grade security measures. These measures include static and dynamic multi-factor authentication methods, strong encryption in-transit and at-rest and the adoption of aggressive web technologies, such as HTTP Strict Transport Security and Content Security Policies, to protect customers from the most common threat vectors. Secure coding practices are enforced through pre-production vulnerability scanning. In 
addition, Wdesk undergoes multiple security assessments each year by our customers and independent security firms. 
Ability to Dynamically Define and Change Business Processes. Wdesk frees users from the confines of traditional business processes by allowing them to dynamically define processes on-demand to support evolving business needs. Wdesk enables multiple users to work in concert, allowing teams to redefine workflows and business processes without the traditional challenges of data integrity, personnel limitations and legacy software limitations. Users can make progress on different sections at different paces and redefine the workflow as needed to adapt to circumstances specific to the production of a single document or report. At the same time, managers gain an added level of insight into organizational dependencies, enabling them to reassign workflow and resources to further increase efficiency and reduce operational cost.
Benefits of Our Solution
Wdesk enables coworkers to simultaneously create, review and publish data-linked documents and reports with greater control, accuracy and productivity. A wide range of decision-makers and other users across our customers’ organizations benefit from using Wdesk. 
Benefits to Decision-Makers
Reduces Risk. Numbers, narrative, charts and graphics can be linked inside Wdesk, which becomes an organization’s central repository for critical data or “single source of truth”. With linked data and a full audit trail, managers can trust that Wdesk spreadsheets, word documents, presentations and reports are up to date and consistent, reducing the risk of reporting incorrect data or taking action based on incorrect data. In addition, Wdesk ensures that presentations and reports are published using the most recent business rules, formats and XBRL protocols. 
Improves Data Transparency. Wdesk provides accountability and transparency through a detailed audit trail that tracks every change made by every user over time. Decision-makers benefit from the ability to drill down into each discrete data point, which increases data transparency, accountability and trust that critical business data across an organization is verified and accurate. A complete record of data provenance and all changes helps our customers mitigate risk, gain insights and make better, data-driven decisions.
Saves Time. Many presentations and reports that are created by using outdated, legacy software are burdened by manual, repetitive processes associated with collecting data, compiling and standardizing inputs across teams and incorporating numerous reviews, comments and revisions. Within the Wdesk platform, documents, data and graphics remain linked in a single version – along with embedded tasks, comments and supporting documentation – which reduces or completely eliminates repetitive, manual tasks, giving teams more time for analysis and other value-added work.
Streamlines Reviews. With Wdesk permission controls, administrators can control access at all levels, down to an individual data point, for each user to create, review and edit data and documents that relate directly to them. This control feature also enables users to grant access to their external auditors, outside counsel, and other consultants, which streamlines the review process and reduces expenses.
Enables Quicker Decision-Making. Wdesk is an intuitive, cloud platform for data consistency and control. Through data linking and a full audit trail, decision-makers who use Wdesk know that they are working on the most current and accurate version, which helps our customers make quicker and better-informed decisions.
Benefits to End Users
Ubiquitous Access. Users can access our Wesk platform through a web-based interface and through our mobile application any time and anywhere an internet connection is available. By providing flexible access to Wdesk, end users can be productive at their workplace, in their homes or on-the-go.
Faster Time to Value. The Wdesk interface is familiar and intuitive so it can be easily deployed in hours or days, enabling new users to make immediate improvements to business data processes. 
Better Collaboration. Our platform enables collaborators to draft and edit original work, assign and respond to tasks, make and resolve comments, track progress and certify sign-offs within the same document, spreadsheet, presentation or report at the same time from any location with internet access. 
Higher Job Satisfaction. Wdesk helps end users reduce or completely eliminate repetitive, manual and time-consuming functions, thereby becoming more efficient and flexible, which we believe leads to greater job satisfaction, employee retention, cross-role training and career mobility. 
Transferable Job Skills. The ability to work in Wdesk is increasingly being recognized as a transferable skill set desired by accounting, finance, compliance and operations teams. Wdesk proficiency often appears in our end users’ resumes and becomes an attractive consideration in promotions within an organization or by recruiters looking for professionals with advanced skills.
Our Growth Strategy
To grow revenue, we are focused on acquiring new customers and expanding our existing customer relationships. Key elements of our growth strategy include: 
Generate Growth From Existing Customers. Wdesk can exhibit a powerful network effect within an enterprise, meaning that the usefulness of our platform attracts additional users and the data that resides in it grows. As more employees of our customers use Wdesk, additional opportunities for collaboration and automation drive demand among their colleagues for add-on seats. Expansion within current customers includes (1) adding users for existing solutions and (2) adding users for new solutions. Examples include SOX compliance reporting and internal audit. 
Pursue New Customers. Our first software solution enabled customers to streamline and automate their SEC regulatory filing process. In 2013, we began expanding into additional markets that are faced with managing large, complex processes with many contributors and disparate sets of business data. We now sell to new customers in the areas of finance and accounting, risk and compliance, audit and internal controls and operations. We intend to continue to build our sales and marketing organization and leverage our brand equity to attract new customers. 
Offer More Solutions. We intend to introduce new solutions to continue to meet growing demand for our Wdesk collaborative work management platform. Our close and trusted relationships with our customers are a source for new use cases, features and solutions. We have a disciplined process for tracking, developing and releasing new solutions that are designed to have immediate, broad applicability, a strong value proposition and a high return on investment for both Workiva and our customers. Our advance planning team assesses customer needs, conducts industry-based research and defines new markets. This vetting process involves our sales, product marketing, customer success, professional services, research and development, finance and senior management teams.
Expand Our International Footprint. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated approximately 94% of our revenue in the United States. However, the growth drivers for our solution are similar in other parts of the world, including the need to reduce errors and risk, improve efficiency and 
respond to complex regulatory requirements. For example, European public companies are subject to regulation similar to SOX. Accordingly, we plan to continue to build our sales presence in Europe. 
Continue to Innovate. We believe we are the first technology company to build an integrated platform on a data management engine that provides a secure ecosystem to manage structured and unstructured business data that spans data collection and linking, controlled collaboration, process management, streamlined reporting and data-driven decision-making. Our research and development efforts are focused on improving the Wdesk platform for broad use across all of our solutions. Our development teams deploy incremental changes to our platform for our customers several times each week. We employ a continuous delivery process supported by Agile software development methodologies and a proprietary quality assurance process. 
In 2016, we enhanced the Wdesk Data Platform, which powers one of the largest and fastest spreadsheet applications in the cloud and improves data relationships for SOX and internal control teams. The Data Platform offers dynamic dashboards, automates reporting, and supports advanced testing and configurable, step-by-step workflows. We plan to continue to provide Wdesk users with even more effective ways to capture, store and connect data, and to manage workflow and documents. 
Growth in Non-SEC Use Cases. We continue to focus on driving the non-SEC side of our business. We believe we have just begun to scratch the surface of these large and growing markets, and therefore, we are continuing to invest in software development, sales and marketing to help Workiva grow. For example, we continue to market Wdesk to the broad-based audit management market. Along with Enterprise Risk Management, audit management is a subset of a much larger market that is defined as Governance, Risk and Compliance – known as GRC – where we see a lot of expansion opportunities. 
Expanding Across Enterprises. Our success in delivering multiple solutions has created demand from numerous customers for a broader-based, enterprise-wide Wdesk solution. In response, we have been evolving our business model, enhancing user management and improving our technology to capitalize on our growing enterprise-wide opportunities, even as we continue to focus on improving operating cash flow. We believe this maturation of broad-based Wdesk use will add seats and revenue and continue to support our high revenue retention rates. While we believe that enterprise-wide deployments are an opportunity to increase our sales of Wdesk, we expect that enterprise-wide deals will be larger and more complex, which tends to lengthen the sales cycle.
Adding Partners. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we began to augment our direct-sales channel with partnerships. Over time, we expect these partners to include technology companies, consultants, service providers and accounting firms. We expect our partners to support our sales efforts through referrals and co-selling arrangements, as well as expand the use of Wdesk through integrated technology offerings.
Wdesk Markets and Use Cases
Our Wdesk collaborative work management platform enables organizations to collect, link, manage, report and analyze their critical data. Today, we offer Wdesk solutions for a wide range of use cases in the following markets:
Finance and Accounting
In the finance and accounting market, we sell Wdesk to public and private companies, state and local governments and universities that use our platform to improve business data processes and create a wide range of documents, presentations and reports for management, investors, boards, regulators, auditors and other stakeholders. 
SEC Reporting. We developed Wdesk to give customers control over the entire SEC reporting process, from data collection to drafting to embedding supporting documentation to the actual filing with XBRL. Our SEC reporting solution allows our customers to prepare and file all major SEC reports, such as Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K, as well as Form S-1 and other registration statements, proxy statements and Section 16 reports. Features tailored to the SEC reporting process include the capability to concurrently create reports in the HTML format required for filing on the SEC’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR) system and the ability to perform XBRL tagging as well as to submit SEC reports with Inline XBRL. Canadian issuers can use Wdesk to draft and file reports on SEDAR. Wdesk also enables customers to create earnings press releases, earnings call scripts, presentations and other investor relations materials with data linked to the corresponding filing. 
Broader Use By Accounting and Finance Teams. Public and private companies, state and local governments and universities must create a vast array of complex financial and managerial reports to better drive real-time business decisions. Wdesk use cases include: strategic planning, budget and forecasting, board committee and quarterly reporting, C-Suite reporting, monthly operation and flash reports; statutory reporting, Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) and budgeting for state and local governments, financial reporting and planning for universities, Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), investments compliance, and integrated financial planning.
Audit and Internal Controls
We sell Wdesk to people who work in Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) compliance, internal controls over financial reporting (ICFR), evidence management, testing, Model Audit Rule (MAR-SOX) for insurance companies, audit management, dashboards, audit risk assessments, planning, legal compliance and issues management. 
SOX and ICFR. Our customers use Wdesk to increase efficiency in documenting, implementing and assessing ICFR as required by SOX. SOX also requires public company CEOs and CFOs to individually certify that their annual and quarterly financial reports are accurate and complete and to assess the effectiveness of their ICFR. Increased scrutiny from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) on audits of management’s assessment of internal controls – and the transition in the framework used for assessing internal controls – is driving public companies to find more efficient and accurate solutions for SOX compliance. With Wdesk, our customers can collect data from multiple departments, centralize that information in a linked platform, create and track process narratives and flows with co-workers, and embed evidence in internal audit work papers. We began selling our Wdesk solution to the SOX market in the second quarter of 2014. As of December 31, 2016, more than 480 customers used Wdesk for SOX and internal controls.
Audit Management. We sell to the broad-based audit management market because users in that market often collaborate with colleagues working in SOX and risk across an organization. Audit management, which is a subset of a much larger market that is defined as Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC), extends throughout an organization, organically drawing in Wdesk users from a wide range of departments. Audit management, which includes audit risk assessments, the audit planning process and the internal audit group, faces the same challenges in managing and documenting information from disparate departments. Wdesk allows simultaneous collaboration with control, accountability and documentation of ICFR that is essential to auditors, executives and boards. With Wdesk permission controls, administrators can control access at all levels, down to an individual data point, for each user to create, review and edit data and documents that relate directly to them. This control feature also enables users to grant access to their external auditors and counsel, which further streamlines the review process and reduces expenses. 
Risk and Compliance
Changing regulations and mandates drive complexity in risk and compliance reporting, which is often carried out by teams scattered across different departments and geographies within organizations. While we cannot predict future changes that could affect federal regulations, we expect demand for Wdesk to remain strong as a platform for improving transparency, accountability and insight into business and government data.
We market Wdesk to address regulatory compliance risk and enterprise risk. Examples of regulations facing our customers include the Dodd-Frank Act, Basel III, Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and Capital Requirements Directive (CRD). Wdesk regulatory compliance risk use cases include Resolution and Recovery Plans (RRP), Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), and Dodd-Frank Stress Testing (DFAST). Regulators are also implementing new, industry-specific reporting requirements. For example, in recent years insurance companies have been required to produce reports for Own Risk Solvency Assessment (ORSA) in the U.S. and Solvency II in Europe.
With Wdesk, risk management practices can be integrated throughout the organization while maintaining information privacy, audit trails and security resulting in highly efficient and transparent compliance. Therefore, we also sell Wdesk for Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) as a solution for enterprises to identify systemic risks, determine risk probabilities, assess risk magnitude, plan strategic responses, and report to boards and other stakeholders. Wdesk also can help business leaders make real-time ERM decisions. 
Operations
Operations teams across organizations of all sizes typically have to collect, track, manage and report on a wide range of operating metrics to better drive real-time business decisions. Our customers continuously find new use cases across their organizations, including board committee and quarterly reporting, C-Suite reporting, strategic business plans, monthly management reports, managing and tracking key performance indicators (KPIs), integrated planning, Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) reporting, data collection for domestic sales, performance reporting, and employee benefit financial statements.
Our Platform Technology
Wdesk is the cloud-based, multi-tenant technology platform upon which all Workiva software solutions run. Wdesk is built on the Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services and is composed of proprietary and open-source technologies. Users can access all Wdesk solutions with any standard web browser, mobile web browsers and iPad and Android applications. We believe that the following characteristics comprise our platform’s key competitive advantages:
Easy to Deploy and Configure. The Wdesk platform can usually be deployed within days for new customers and can be easily configured by the customer for individual employees or entire teams. Because our solutions are browser-based, customers avoid costly, time-intensive deployments typically associated with on-premise enterprise software.
High Performance. The performance of the Wdesk technology platform has been tested and proven by some of the largest, most demanding enterprises in the world. Our platform is built for organizations of all sizes. The architecture, design, deployment and management of our solutions are focused on enterprise-grade scalability, availability and security. Our underlying code base is continually optimized in order to ensure high performance for our users.
Always On. Our customers are highly dependent on our solutions for their business data management and reporting needs. As a result, Wdesk is designed as an “always on” service. Additionally, constant customer 
collaboration and development iteration allows us to offer our customers continuous improvements by releasing a new version of Wdesk nearly every business day. 
Scales Rapidly. Wdesk is designed to support concurrent user sessions within a global enterprise, managing hundreds of millions of data elements while continuing to deliver rapid processing performance. A number of our customers have reported millions of links to single sources of data, among multiple documents, spreadsheets and presentations, without any noticeable negative effects on performance. Wdesk is designed to support millions of end users as a result of its scalability and our relationship with the Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services.
Secure. Many of the largest enterprises in the world trust us with their most sensitive data. Wdesk employs stringent data security, reliability, integrity and privacy practices. In addition to our regular customer security assessments, we aggressively test the security of our operations by subjecting it to continuous and ongoing penetration and vulnerability testing (manual and automatic, internal and third-party). The quality of our data security efforts is validated by our annual completion of an independent audit process using the SSAE 16 standard. This standard is designed to determine whether a company has internal controls and safeguards that are suitably designed and effectively operating. The annual SSAE 16 examination includes coverage of security controls through performing SOC 1 Type 2 and SOC 2 Type 2 audits.
Research and Development 
Our research and development team is distributed among nine office locations in North America and Europe, including our headquarters in Ames, Iowa. 
Our research and development efforts are focused on improving the Wdesk platform for broad use across all of our solutions. Our development teams can deploy incremental changes to our platform for our customers on a daily basis. We employ a continuous delivery process supported by Agile software development methodologies and a proprietary quality assurance process. Our spending on research and development was $57.4 million in 2016, $50.5 million in 2015, and $44.1 million in 2014. Our investment in research and development has grown due to increased compensation and headcount related to dedicating more resources to the continued addition of new features and functionality to our platform.
To ensure new features are intuitive and efficient, each development team has a dedicated user interface designer who is focused on delivering an optimized user experience. Additionally, we continuously test our software code using a combination of quality assurance personnel and a proprietary automated testing suite. We believe our focus on user experience and our rigorous quality assurance culture are key differentiators that contribute to the success of our Wdesk platform.
Our Customers
Workiva is trusted by thousands of organizations, including global enterprises with hundreds of thousands of employees. As of December 31, 2016, we had more than 2,700 customers, including more than 70% of Fortune 500 companies. Our solutions change and optimize the way our customers do their work. Our customers are passionate, loyal supporters of our solutions, as demonstrated by our subscription and support revenue retention rate of 95.4% (excluding add-on seats) as of the December 2016 measurement date. Our subscription and support revenue retention rate including add-on seats was 107.4% as of the December 2016 measurement date.
Our Competition
The intensity and nature of our competition varies significantly across our different solutions, as changes in regulation and market trends result in evolving customer requirements for enterprise software. Our primary competition includes: 

• | Manual business processes that rely on legacy business productivity tools;


• | Diversified enterprise software providers;


• | Niche software providers that provide point solutions;


• | Providers of professional services, including consultants and business and financial printers;


• | Governance, risk and compliance software providers; and


• | Business intelligence / corporate performance management software providers.

As our market grows, we expect it will attract more highly specialized software vendors as well as larger vendors that may continue to acquire or bundle their products more effectively. 
The principal competitive factors in our market include: product features, reliability, performance and effectiveness; product line breadth, diversity and applicability; product extensibility and ability to integrate with other technology infrastructures; price and total cost of ownership; adherence to industry standards and certifications; strength of sales and marketing efforts; and brand awareness and reputation. We believe that our cloud-based, collaborative work management platform has the combination of features and value to our customers that will continue to allow us to compete favorably. 
Sales and Marketing
Our “land-and-expand” sales strategy focuses on acquiring new customers and growing our existing customer relationships. We believe that we have penetrated only a small fraction of our market opportunity, and we intend to continue investing in sales and marketing to drive growth. 
Sales
Our sales organization is responsible for generating new customer opportunities and growing add-on sales. Our sales teams are structured by market segment and geographic locations. We believe our direct-sales approach allows us to effectively reach customers and prospects in a way that allows us to maintain control over the contract terms and build lasting relationships with our users. 
In the fourth quarter of 2016, we began to augment our direct-sales channel with partnerships. Over time, we expect these partners to include technology companies, consultants, service providers and accounting firms. We expect partnerships to support our sales efforts with referrals from third parties and co-selling arrangements, as well as expand the use of Wdesk through integrated technology offerings.
Our sales organization comprises sales development representatives, pre-solutions engineers and account managers. Our sales development representatives qualify sales-accepted opportunities for our account managers. Our pre-solutions engineers focus on solutions and custom product demonstrations and consultative sales. Our account managers work to attract new customers as well as expand Wdesk into new use cases and departments across our current customers’ organizations. 
Our customer success and professional services teams also help our account managers grow our existing customer relationships by providing advice and best practices that enable users to harness the full power of Wdesk.
We expect to continue to strengthen our sales coverage in our current markets, as well as expand our sales footprint in locations where we see a demand for our solutions. To achieve this growth, we plan to continue to hire energetic and motivated sales people with experience in large enterprise software sales organizations. We believe that our approach to hiring sales people, along with a progressive training, culture and compensation package will allow us to retain sales talent and continue to drive growth. 
Marketing 
Our marketing organization promotes our brand, generates demand for our offerings and researches and assesses product and market needs. Our advance planning team assesses customer needs, conducts industry-based research and defines new markets. Our product marketing team develops the go-to-market strategy for Wdesk as well as the applications built upon the platform and develops industry-level marketing messages. The product marketing team also supports our sales team with profiles of typical buyers, key messages, value propositions, competitive analysis and sales strategies. 
Our demand generation programs are categorized by solution and industry and are focused on engaging business leaders, process owners and technology teams. We use a variety of marketing programs across traditional and social channels to target current and prospective customers, including:

• | Using our website to engage and educate prospects on our platform and solutions.


• | Employing search engine marketing and advertising, including search engine optimization and pay-per-click, to drive traffic to our website.


• | Engaging customers and prospects through content marketing on social media, including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube.


• | Working with industry analysts to establish third-party validation and generate positive coverage for our platform and solutions.


• | Sponsoring events and professional organizations, including the SEC Professionals Group and the SOX and Internal Controls Professionals Group.


• | Producing webinars, workshops and customer meetings.


• | Hosting our annual user conference, The Exchange Community (TEC), which brings our customers together with our developers, professional services and customer success managers to learn and collaborate. TEC is our largest user event each year and features sessions with industry leaders, business networking events and opportunities to share product ideas.


• | Executing digital and print campaigns through advertising, e-mails and direct marketing.


• | Creating sales tools and field marketing events to support our sales organization to more effectively convert leads into customers.

Professional Services and Customer Success
We believe our professional services and customer success teams are essential elements of our long-term success and differentiate our service from our competitors. 
Professional Services. Professional Services include initial setup of documents; XBRL mapping, tagging and review; best practices implementation; and business process consulting. Our XBRL team is 
primarily composed of people with accounting or financial reporting experience who work with our customers to perform XBRL mapping, tagging and review services. We also employ a team of Solution Architects who offer consulting services to customers to improve and streamline their Wdesk-related business data processes. 
Customer Success. Our customer success teams support our customers with in-depth knowledge and continuity for each customer’s use of Wdesk. Our customer success managers provide 24/7 live customer support via phone, digital messaging and web-based conferencing. Each customer has an assigned customer success manager who is accountable for that customer’s satisfaction. We provide intensive training to our customer success employees and segment them for each solution and market focus. We have an in-house, e-learning curriculum called “The Learn Center” for professional services and customer success employees to continue to develop skills related to Wdesk products, key markets and solution areas, management and compliance. The Learn Center also helps our employees stay current with industry and technology issues. In addition, we pay for employees to maintain professional certifications and licenses that are important to our customers, and we host regular company-wide employee education sessions on business, industry, technology and workplace topics.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our business. To safeguard these rights, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and contractual protections in the United States and other jurisdictions.
As of December 31, 2016, we had 24 issued patents and 19 patent applications pending in the United States relating to our platform. We cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to narrow or otherwise limit our claims. Any patents issued may be contested, designed around, found unenforceable, or invalidated, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them. We also license software from third parties for integration into our solutions, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms. We cannot assure you that such third parties will maintain such software or continue to make it available.
We control access to and use of our proprietary software and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, end-customers, and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright laws. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses, and confidentiality agreements, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and technology. In addition, we intend to expand our international operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark, and trade-secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.
If we become more successful, we believe that competitors will be more likely to try to develop solutions and services that are similar to ours and that may infringe our proprietary rights. It may also be more likely that competitors or other third parties will claim that our platform infringes their proprietary rights.
Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. In particular, leading companies in the enterprise software industry have extensive patent portfolios and are regularly involved in both offensive and defensive litigation. From time to time, third parties, including certain of these leading companies, may assert claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us, and our standard license and other agreements obligate us to indemnify our customers against such claims. Successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from distributing certain solutions or performing certain services, require us to expend time and money to develop non-infringing solutions, or 
force us to pay substantial damages (including enhanced damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights), royalties or other fees. In addition, to the extent that we gain greater visibility and market exposure as a public company, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims from third parties. We cannot assure you that we do not currently infringe, or that we will not in the future infringe, upon any third-party patents, copyrights or other proprietary rights.    
We have registered the “Workiva,” “Wdesk” and “WebFilings” trademarks and logos with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in several jurisdictions outside the United States. We have also registered other trademarks in the United States and in other jurisdictions outside the United States. In addition, we intend to expand our international operations, and we cannot assure you that these names will be available for use in all such jurisdictions.
Litigation
From time to time we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently believe that the final outcome of any currently pending legal proceedings to which we are a party will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had 1,172 full-time employees. Our headcount as of December 31, 2016 increased 4.5% from our headcount as of December 31, 2015. None of our employees is represented by a labor organization or is a party to any collective bargaining arrangement. We have never experienced a strike or similar work stoppage, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. 
Corporate Information
We were formed in California in August 2008 as WebFilings LLC. In July 2014, we changed our name to Workiva LLC, and we converted into a Delaware limited liability company in September 2014. On December 10, 2014, Workiva LLC was converted into a Delaware corporation and renamed Workiva Inc.
