BUSINESS

On April 17, 2012, Mr. Vagner Gomes Tome, our former president and sole director, incorporated the Company in the State of Nevada and established a fiscal year end of April 30th. On May 23, 2013 the Company accepted the resignation of Vagner Gomes Tome as the sole director and officer of the Company and accepted the appointment of Joelyn Alcantara to serve in his stead. Thereafter, on April 25, 2017, Ms. Joelyn Alcantara resigned from all positions with the Company, including those of President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, Secretary and Sole-Director. The resignation was not the result of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies or practices.
 
On April 25, 2017, Mr. Francisco Ariel Acosta was appointed as the sole member of the Company’s Board of Directors and as the Company’s President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, and Secretary.
 
The objective of this corporation remains to introduce advertisement in nightclub line-ups.
 
We are a development-stage Company that intends to provide streaming televised advertisements for our customers lining up on the outside of the nightclubs. The idea is to showcase that particular nightclub’s scene, special events, deals on drink specials and advertisements from local businesses and other companies. We plan on providing the TV at no cost to the club and generate revenue through the sale of advertisements from local restaurants, cigarette companies, alcohol companies, clothing companies and for sports and entertainment events.
 
On December 13, 2013, Vagner Gomes Tome surrendered for cancellation 7,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company. On March 10, 2014, Ms. Alcantara, our former sole-officer and director, acquired the remaining 500,000 shares of common stock of the Company formerly owned by Vagner Gomes Tome, the former sole-officer and director, for a purchase price of $0.05 per share. Ms. Alcantara is still the holder of 65.7% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company and is the majority shareholder of the Company. 
 
As of the date of this annual filing, we have not yet contacted any potential clients. Furthermore, we have not yet developed our systems and services. We have not yet implemented our business model and to date, have generated no revenues.

We have not been involved in any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings since our incorporation nor has we been involved in any reclassifications, mergers or consolidations. We have no plans to change our business activities. At the present time, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash. We will need additional cash and if we are unable to raise it, we will either suspend marketing operations until we do raise the cash necessary to continue our business plan, or we cease operations entirely.
 
Plan of Operation
 
After we have raised enough funds to start our plan of operations, we plan to accomplish the following steps:
 

Market Research | 2 months 
----------------------------------------------------+----------
Equipment Purchase | 2 months 
Tests and website development | 3 months 
Secure Contracts with nightclub owners | 2 months 
Search for local business for initial advertisement | 3 months 
TOTAL | 12 months

 
Estimated time frame for completion of each step of our Plan of Operations.
 
Market research
 
We plan to have a detailed ‘map’ of night clubs locations and possible local businesses that could benefit from our services. We expect to understand the demographic of the clubs and we also plan to interview patrons who attend and frequent the club, to have an idea of how long they believe they usually stand in line and the usual time frame that people stand outside on particular evenings of operation. Gathering this information is essential to the Company so we can make the proper decisions and outline the best strategies for our business. The Company’s president will be responsible for conducting market research and/or hiring a third party to perform this task if finances allow.
 
We expect to spend between $550 and $25,000 in market research.
 
Equipment purchase
 
We estimate that the cost for each outdoor weather proof TV case will range from $1,000 to $6,000; depending on the manufacturer and TV size.
 
TV’s are widely available and they range in price, depending on the brand and size, from $500 to $3,000.
 
The Company’s president will be responsible for the equipment purchase.
 
The Company expects to invest between $1,000 and $32,000 for the purchase of equipment. 
 
Tests and website development
 
After we acquire the initial necessary equipment, we plan on running tests simulating actual situations, such as visibility of the TV in different positions, finding the best possible placement for the TV. We may also consider weather conditions and lighting, among other factors that may arise. We intend to finalize our website (www.lineupad.com), currently under construction, including a detailed explanation of our systems with pictures and videos. Additionally, we plan on hiring third-party technicians and/or engineers to help with the tests and a third-party web developer to finalize our website. Our president will be responsible for hiring third-party personnel and he will oversee all development. Our president will be responsible for running all the tests, depending on the funds available to the Company.
 
We intend to allocate between $504 and $6,500 for testing and website development.

Secure contracts with nightclub owners
 
After we decide on a pre-set system and standards for our services and products, we believe that we will have a better understanding of the functionality of our business. At that time, we may be able to present our idea in a more organized manner, and instruct how it will work. These factors would give us a better chance to secure contracts with club owners and managers.
 
The Company’s president will deal with all negotiations and he may decide to hire sub-contracted sales personnel, if finances allow.
 
We expect to allocate $450 and $6,000 to cover costs related to securing contracts with nightclub owners.
 
Search for local businesses for initial advertisement
 
After securing our initial club contract and setting our first TV(s) up, we plan on finding advertisements from local businesses, such as after hour stores, late night eateries, taxi companies, etc. We estimate that a video to be used for our TV’s can be produced and edited in no more than 7 days.
 
We believe that our cost to produce the video advertisements will be very low, because we could use existing material from the advertising client’s website or simply use pictures and or videos to be provided by the client (nowadays, digital pictures and videos are very accessible).
 
The Company’s president will deal with all the negotiations and he may decide to hire sub-contracted sales personnel, if finances allow. Initially, the Company’s president will be responsible for editing the videos.
 
We plan on investing between $400 and $7,300 to search for local businesses for initial advertisement.
 
Office supplies, Stationery, Telephones, Internet
 
We intend to allocate between $60 and $1,164 to cover these costs, at the president’s discretion.
 
After successfully completing the above described steps, we believe we will start generating revenue.
 
As of the date of this filing, the Company has generated no revenues and has not entered into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any third party. The Company intends to raise capital cash to initiate its business plan through debt or equity financing. Failure to raise funds will require the Company to cease operations. Other than as described in this paragraph, we have no other financing plans.
 
Management does not plan to hire additional employees at this time. Our President will be responsible for the initial product sourcing. We intend to hire sales representatives initially on a commission only basis to keep administrative overhead to a minimum. We will use third party web designers to build and maintain our website.
