Item 1. Business
Our Company 
Verint® Systems Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “Verint”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our”, unless the context indicates otherwise) helps brands provide Boundless Customer Engagement™. For more than two decades, the world’s most iconic brands – including more than 85 of the Fortune 100 companies – have trusted Verint to provide the technology and domain expertise they require to effectively build enduring customer relationships.
Brands today are challenged by new workforce dynamics, ever-expanding customer engagement channels and exponentially more consumer interactions – all with limited budgets and resources. As a result, brands are finding it more challenging to deliver the desired customer experience. This creates an Engagement Capacity Gap™, which is widening as digital transformation continues. Organizations are increasingly seeking technology to close this gap, solutions that are based on artificial intelligence (AI) and analytics to automate workflows across enterprise silos to optimize the workforce expense and at the same time to drive an elevated consumer experience. 
Verint is uniquely positioned to help organizations close the capacity gap with our differentiated Verint Cloud Platform. 
Verint is headquartered in Melville, New York, and has more than 40 offices worldwide. We have approximately 4,300 passionate professionals around the globe exclusively focused on helping brands provide Boundless Customer Engagement™. 
Background
We were incorporated in Delaware in February 1994 and completed our initial public offering in May 2002. 
On February 1, 2021, we completed the spin-off (the “Spin-Off”) of Cognyte Software Ltd. (“Cognyte”), whose business and operations consisted of our former Cyber Intelligence Solutions business (the “Cognyte Business”), into an independent public company. For additional information regarding Cognyte and the Cognyte Business, see “The Cognyte Spin-Off” below.
Through our website at www.verint.com, we make available our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K, as well as amendments to those reports, filed or furnished by us pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such materials with, or furnish such materials to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Our website address set forth above is not intended to be an active link, and information on our website is not incorporated in, and should not be construed to be a part of, this report.
Market Opportunity and Trends
We believe there are three main market trends that are benefiting Verint today: the acceleration of digital transformation across the enterprise, the widening of the Engagement Capacity Gap as brands need to elevate customer experiences with fixed resources and budgets, and the ongoing adoption of cloud and AI in our industry.
•Digital Transformation is Accelerating. Long gone are the days when customer journeys were limited to phone calls into a contact center. Today, customer journeys take place across many touchpoints in the enterprise and across many communication and collaboration platforms, with digital leading the way. Customer touchpoints take place in contact centers, in back-office and branch operations, in ecommerce, in digital marketing, in self-service, and in customer experience departments. The breadth of customer touchpoints, the rapid growth in digital interactions, and the emergence of the new workforce – with humans and bots working together – are creating demand for new solutions. 
•The Engagement Capacity Gap is Widening. Brands are seeking to differentiate themselves by providing consumers with a strong brand experience. But they cannot afford to do so by hiring more people. With the exponential growth in digital journeys and more demanding consumer expectations, organizations require more resources, but hiring more knowledge workers and further increasing workforce expenses is often not a sustainable solution. This creates an Engagement Capacity Gap, and as the digital transformation accelerates, the gap is widening. Brands are looking for new technology and solutions to help close the Engagement Capacity Gap. 
•The Market is Shifting Rapidly to Cloud-Based, AI-Driven Solutions. To effectively address the Engagement Capacity Gap, brands are seeking open, cloud-based solutions to break down silos and facilitate the sharing of data across enterprise functions. Brands also are seeking to leverage AI and other advanced data analytic tools to reduce manual work, increase workforce efficiency, and manage the new workforce of humans and bots. 
We estimated our total addressable market (“TAM”) to be approximately $65 billion and growing at approximately 10% per year. Approximately $30 billion of this TAM is derived from customer engagement software for contact center use cases, and the other $35 billion is derived from other use cases across other parts of the enterprise outside of the contact center with customer touch points. We estimated our TAM using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, McGee Smith Analytics, Pelorus Associates, Gartner, and Company estimates for the number of customer engagement employees and the amount of software investment that is spent on average per employee per year. 
Our Strategy
We offer our customers and partners an open and modular cloud platform, strong AI and analytics capabilities, and significant customer engagement domain expertise developed over two decades of working closely with thousands of customers across many industries and global operations. Our strategy is to capitalize on the trends described above by: 
•Helping Brands with Their Digital Transformation. Brands are investing in digital transformation across many areas, including customer engagement. Our strategy is to help them successfully adopt digital technology to evolve and enhance their customer engagement activities and achieve strategic objectives. 
•Connecting Work, Data, and Experiences to Close the Engagement Capacity Gap. Our open cloud platform enables organizations to connect work, data, and experiences across the enterprise to close the Engagement Capacity Gap. It enables organizations to connect work performed by humans and bots across enterprise functions. It enables organizations to leverage interaction data across silos regardless of channel type or modality. And it enables organizations to capture experiences and derive insights that can improve operational efficiency and elevate customer experience.
•Delivering an Open, Modular Cloud Platform and Innovative AI and Analytical Applications. Our cloud platform is highly open and modular allowing customers to turn on applications based on their specific strategic priorities. Embedded in the platform is our Verint Da Vinci AI and Analytics™ - state-of-the-art machine learning, natural language processing, and deep learning algorithms. Our strategy is to increase the use of artificial intelligence and analytics technologies across our portfolio to further help organizations close the Engagement Capacity Gap.
•Expanding our Partner Network by Being Partner Friendly. We are expanding our relationships with existing partners and adding new partners. As part of our partner friendly strategy, we provide our partners with tools, enablement and support to make them successful. We believe we are increasingly becoming the partner of choice, and our partner strategy is a growth driver for Verint.
Our Solutions
The Verint Cloud Platform offers a broad set of applications that fall into three solution areas: Future of Work, Experience Management, and Engagement Data Management. 
Future of Work
Our Future of Work applications help brands manage their customer engagement work and their modern workforce across the enterprise – empowering a workforce of humans and bots, enabling connected work across all silos, and driving real-time work actions. Within this solution area, we offer applications for the following purposes:
•Forecasting & Scheduling: Understand the work needed to meet and exceed customer expectations, determine the optimal resourcing strategy to address it with employees and automation, and provide staff across all customer touchpoints with flexible scheduling options for balancing work and personal needs.
•Quality & Compliance: Use automation and analytics to make customer interactions across both attended and self-service channels more pleasant, productive, and secure, while empowering employees with the skills they need to deliver outstanding service.
•Interaction Insights: Extract insights from structured and unstructured customer interactions and activities across the enterprise to drive strategy, productivity, customer loyalty, and revenue.
•Real-Time Work: Support in-the-moment workforce activities with workflows, guidance, assistance, and automation to enhance customer experiences, workforce engagement, and compliance, while reducing operating costs.
•Self-Service: Connect customers and employees with the information, resources, and support they need, when they need it, across voice and digital channels for improved experiences, business-changing insights, and rapid return on investment.
•Case Management: Improve employee efficiency, time to resolution, compliance, and customer satisfaction with workflows and automation that simplify and expedite case handling. Provide seamless customer experiences across email, messaging, chat, and secure messaging.
•Knowledge Management: Help agents deliver stellar service with tools for accessing content across the organization, delivering consistent, compliant answers, and achieving compliance with regulations and processes.
Experience Management
The Experience Management applications help brands collect and analyze customer experience data across all customer journeys - including direct, indirect, and inferred experiences - across digital, contact center, and location touchpoints. With a complete and unified view of the customer experience, brands are empowered with insights and actions to improve engagement from every level of the organization. Within this solution area, we offer applications for the following purposes:
•Digital Experience: Monitor customer-initiated feedback via web and mobile channels throughout the digital customer journey in real time. 
•Enterprise Experience: Capture experience data across all channels and unify feedback throughout the organization while eliminating “feedback fatigue” and improving response rates.
•Interaction Experience: Use dynamic, voice surveys following a contact center interaction to understand and improve the effectiveness of people, products, and processes. 
•Predictive Experience: Listen and act on customer and employee experiences with models and scientific rigor to predict future behavior and prioritize the best, most effective ways to improve engagements.
Engagement Data Management
The Engagement Data Management applications help brands unify and normalize their data across any customer touchpoint into a single view at scale and provide customers with open access to their data. Within this solution area, we offer applications for the following purposes: 
•Data Management: To simplify interaction data management, configurable workflows are available to help organizations manage and audit retention and access. Open APIs and adapters allow organizations to freely export data to feed a data lake, or other applications.
•Enrichment: Use analytics tools to enrich the data and make it easier to unlock the value in the data. 
•Compliance: Interaction data storage, access, retention, and compliance in one place to make it easier to enforce the requirements of PCI, HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA, and other regulations. 
Verint Cloud Platform
The Verint Cloud Platform is designed with native cloud architecture that is open and is powered by Verint Da Vinci AI and Analytics™.
•Native Cloud Architecture: With a native cloud architecture, the Verint Cloud Platform was designed for multicloud support, capable of running in leading cloud infrastructure environments. The native cloud architecture accelerates 
innovation by standardizing our approach to microservice container architectures and fully automated development operations to speed development while improving reliability and security.
•Open Imperative: The shift to cloud, the explosion in AI, and the growth of the API economy have dramatically changed customer and partner expectations regarding what they need from their core technology vendors. The days of the single vendor with a closed ecosystem are long gone. Verint’s open platform is more than the technology alone – it includes the tools needed to foster a rich partner and customer ecosystem around our applications. These tools include: (1) a marketplace where Verint and partner components are made available to accelerate time to value with downloadable extensions and (2) a developer portal where customers can engage directly with the Verint technical community. Our APIs are available to test, with code samples, developer sandboxes, downloadable test clients, education, and discussion forums.
•Verint Da Vinci AI and Analytics™: Verint has been well known for its leading AI and analytics capabilities for many years. We have now packaged these capabilities into what we call Verint Da Vinci AI and Analytics and have embedded it natively in the Verint Cloud Platform. Verint’s Da Vinci services are delivered through the Verint Cloud Platform and used by our applications to infuse AI across the Verint portfolio. These services use state of the art machine learning, natural language processing, and deep learning algorithms honed on our unique data set. Verint Da Vinci represents over two decades of research into optimizing customer engagement.
In addition to the Verint Cloud Platform, Verint continues to develop and enhance its Workforce Engagement (WFE) Premises Platform. Customers running the Premises Platform may choose to keep their applications on premises, while adding applications from the Verint Cloud Platform. They can also choose to convert to the Verint Cloud Platform when they are ready to move their applications to the cloud. Verint is committed to providing our customers with choice and flexibility when it comes to deploying solutions on premises or in the cloud. We can help our customers evolve customer engagement at their own pace, while protecting their existing investments with minimal disruption to their operations.
Our Customers 
Our customer engagement solutions are used by approximately 10,000 organizations in 175 countries across a diverse set of verticals, including financial services, healthcare, utilities, technology, and government. Our customers include large enterprises with thousands of employees, as well as small to medium sized business (SMB) organizations. Excluding the Cognyte Business, in the year ended January 31, 2021, we derived approximately 69%, 21%, and 10% of our revenue from sales to customers in the Americas, in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), and in the Asia-Pacific (“APAC”) regions, respectively, with no single customer accounting for or exceeding 10% of our revenue. 
Seasonality and Cyclicality 
As is typical for many software and technology companies, our business is subject to seasonal and cyclical factors. In most years, our revenue and operating income are typically highest in the fourth quarter and lowest in the first quarter (prior to the impact of unusual or nonrecurring items). Moreover, revenue and operating income in the first quarter of a new year may be lower than in the fourth quarter of the preceding year, in some years, potentially by a significant margin. In addition, we generally receive a higher volume of orders in the last month of a quarter, with orders concentrated in the later part of that month. We believe that these seasonal and cyclical factors primarily reflect customer spending patterns and budget cycles, as well as the impact of compensation incentive plans for our sales personnel. While seasonal and cyclical factors such as these are common in the software and technology industry, this pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future revenue or financial performance. Many other factors, including general economic conditions, also have an impact on our business and financial results. See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this report for a more detailed discussion of factors which may affect our business and financial results.
Direct and Indirect Sales
We sell our solutions through our direct sales teams and indirect channels. Our direct sales teams are focused on large and mid-sized customers and, in many cases, co-sell with our indirect channels. Our indirect channels address large and midsize customers, but also sell to smaller customers. Our direct sales teams and indirect channels are supported by business consultants, solutions specialists, and presales engineers who, during the sales process, help determine customer requirements and develop technical responses to those requirements.
Customer Success
We help our customers achieve success and maximize their return on investment in our solutions through a range of services.
Cloud Operations. We deploy our cloud applications in multiple cloud environments. We provide our customers with service-level commitments with respect to uptime and support.
Managed Services. We offer a range of managed services that are recurring in nature and can be delivered in conjunction with Verint’s technology or on a standalone basis and help build strong relationships with our customers.
Implementation. Configurations, commissioning, integrations, and other implementation work can be performed by us, our authorized partners, or by end customers themselves. 
Training. Training programs are designed for customers and to certify our partners. Customer and partner training is provided at the customer site, at our training centers around the world, and/or remotely online.
Consulting. We and our partners offer customers help to maximize the value of our solutions including business strategy, process excellence, performance management, and project and program management.
Support. We offer a range of support plans to our customers and partners, designed to help ensure long-term successful use of our solutions. 
Research and Development 
We continue to enhance the features and performance of our existing solutions and to introduce new solutions through extensive R&D activities. Our research and development team, which is comprised of data scientists, PhDs and other technical experts, have deep software expertise, particularly related to artificial intelligence, data aggregation and curation, predictive analytics, specialized language and vocabulary, and several other key areas that support our strategic initiatives. In addition to the development of new solutions and the addition of capabilities to existing solutions, our R&D activities include quality assurance and advanced technical support for our customer services organization. R&D is performed primarily in the United States, Israel, the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, Hungary, and Indonesia.
To support our research and development efforts, we make significant investments in R&D every year. We have a well-defined roadmap to introduce new features and functionality that we believe will further enhance the value of our solutions to our customers. We allocate our R&D resources in response to market research and customer demand for additional features and solutions. Our development strategy involves rolling out initial releases of our products and adding features over time. We incorporate product feedback received from our customers into our product development process. While the majority of our products are developed internally, in some cases, we also acquire or license technologies, products, and applications from third parties based on timing and cost considerations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Markets, Competition, and Operations—For certain services, products, or components, including our cloud hosting operations, we rely on third-party providers which may create significant exposure for us” under Item 1A of this report.
Third-Party Suppliers 
For certain services, products, or components, including our cloud hosting operations, we rely on third-party providers, which may create significant exposure for us. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Markets, Competition, and Operations—For certain services, products, or components, including our cloud hosting operations, we rely on third-party providers, which may create significant exposure for us” under Item 1A of this report for a discussion of risks associated with our suppliers.
Human Capital
At Verint, we are committed to conducting our business in an ethical manner and to creating value for all of our stakeholders: customers and partners, employees and shareholders, the communities in which we work, and the global community at large. 
As of January 31, 2021, excluding the Cognyte Business, we employed approximately 4,300 professionals, including certain contractors, with approximately 47%, 32%, and 21% of our employees and contractors located in the Americas, EMEA (including Israel), and APAC, respectively. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and a critical factor in our success. 
Our employees in the United States are not covered by any collective bargaining agreements. In some cases, our employees outside the United States are automatically subject to certain protections negotiated by organized labor in those countries directly with the government or trade unions, or are automatically entitled to severance or other benefits mandated under local laws.
Culture and Values
Verint is built on five core values that shape the way we do business with our customers, our partners, and each other. They express the company we want Verint to be — from the people we hire to the way we design our products — and they guide us in the decisions we make every day. Our five core values are:
•The integrity to do what’s right
•The innovation to create leading solutions for real-world challenges
•The transparency that fuels mutual trust and productive, collaborative working relationships
•The humility to view our successes as milestones in our journey, and our mistakes as opportunities for improvement
•A passion for making our customers and partners successful
These values embody the spirit of Verint and form the foundation for our objectives of superior solutions, unparalleled service, and an unwavering commitment to customer success.
Diversity and Inclusion
We embrace differences and work to cultivate an inclusive organization. We believe in providing a supportive environment and opportunities for all of our employees to develop and advance. We support diverse groups in the workplace, with equal terms of employment, professional opportunities, and benefits. We recognize differences in family composition and our U.S. benefit plans provide options for employees in diverse family circumstances including domestic partner benefits, adoption assistance, and fertility assistance. We track and report on our global diversity results to our board of directors. For the year ended January 31, 2021, our gender composition increased slightly, as did our minority versus non-minority employee composition, for the combined company, and after giving effect to the Spin-Off, we increased the number of women within our business leadership team by 5% to 18% over the last fiscal year. We intend to continue to focus on gender and inclusion, including through recruitment and promotional opportunities, in the current year ending January 31, 2022 and beyond.
In 2020, we established a Diversity & Inclusion Council. The Council’s mandate is to help us foster an environment that attracts and retains the best talent, values diversity of life experiences and perspectives, educates our personnel, and encourages innovation. The Diversity & Inclusion Council currently has several initiatives underway, including partnering with non-profit organizations for on-going support, and an educational series to recognize meaningful holidays throughout the year. The Diversity & Inclusion Council increases cultural and diversity awareness within our organization and encourages employees to continue to drive outreach opportunities through employee and recruiting events.
Community Outreach
At Verint, we are committed to giving back to the communities in which we live and work. In 2005, we launched the Verint Next-Generation Program, which engages Verint employees around the globe in projects that benefit children in need. The program puts our core values to work in our local communities, with the goal of affording the next generation greater opportunities and the tools for making the most of them. As part of the program, Verint employees engage in various community activities, from supplying food pantries, to participating in blood drives, to collecting clothing and school supplies, to building playgrounds, to cleaning parks and planting gardens. Verint is also proud to support our employees’ community service activities with programs for donating employee time to qualified children’s organizations and matching grants. In 2020, Verint employees in the United States donated over $300,000 of paid time off to children’s charities through the program. Globally, over 500 Verint employees donated their time by participating in more than 50 events to help raise money, clothing, and food for those that are underprivileged. In 2020, we also focused on supporting events to help families struggling due to the COVID-19 pandemic by providing food and clothing to those in need.
Employee Development
At Verint, we are dedicated to providing a productive, ethical, and safe working environment in which innovation and market leadership can flourish. We recognize that our employees are the driving force behind Verint’s success. Our fast-paced, challenging, and collaborative work environment nurtures professional growth and offers a wide array of career advancement 
opportunities, and our workforce planning tools provide managers with a framework for thinking strategically about the talent our company requires to achieve our business goals.
Continuous learning and the professional development of our employees are key factors in our success. Verint’s approach is based on the learning philosophy of "70:20:10". We believe that seventy percent of skill development occurs through on-the-job experiences, twenty percent through colleague and leadership interactions, and ten percent through formal professional and academic learning opportunities. All our employees are afforded the opportunity to take part in our training programs, with the ability to focus their learning on the skills and knowledge that are most relevant for their professional development. We offer thousands of training courses in our online Learning Center in addition to classroom trainings. Throughout the pandemic, we have encouraged our employees to continue their professional development and acquisition of knowledge and skills, through existing and newly developed online learning.
Employees may also establish an Individual Development Plan in collaboration with their managers to establish and facilitate the employee’s short- and long-term development goals. These plans are tailored to the employee’s own individual competencies and aspirations in the context of our business goals and available opportunities.
Please see the Sustainability Report in the Corporate Responsibility section of our website for further information on our Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives, including with respect to human capital. 
Competition 
We face strong competition from many vendors, some of whom focus on customer engagement and some of whom offer customer engagement-related capabilities. Key competitors include Aspect Software, Inc., Calabrio, Inc., Genesys Telecommunications, Medallia Inc., NICE Systems Ltd., Nuance Communications, Inc., Pegasystems Inc., divisions of larger companies, including Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, SAP, and Salesforce.com, Inc., as well as many smaller companies, which vary from region to region globally.
We believe that we compete principally on the basis of:
•Product performance and functionality;
•Product quality and reliability;
•Breadth of product portfolio and pre-defined integrations;
•Global presence, reputation, and high-quality customer service and support;
•Specific domain expertise, industry knowledge, vision, and experience; and 
•Price.
We believe that our competitive success depends primarily on our ability to provide technologically advanced and cost-effective solutions and services. Some of our competitors have superior brand recognition and significantly greater financial or other resources than we do. We expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter our markets or we enter theirs, and as new products, services, technologies, and delivery methods are introduced. In addition, consolidation is common in our markets and has in the past and may in the future improve the position of our competitors. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Markets, Competition, and Operations—Intense competition in our markets and competitors with greater resources than us may limit our market share, profitability, and growth” under Item 1A of this report for a more detailed discussion of the competitive risks we face.
Intellectual Property Rights 
General
Our success depends to a significant degree on the legal protection of our software and other proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws, and confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with employees and third parties to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
Patents
As of January 31, 2021, after giving effect to the Cognyte Spin-Off, we had more than 600 patents and patent applications worldwide across areas including data capture, artificial intelligence, machine learning, unstructured data analytics, predictive analytics, and automation. We regularly review new areas of technology related to our businesses to determine whether they can and should be patented.
Licenses
Our customer and partner license agreements prohibit the unauthorized use, copying, and disclosure of our software technology and contain customer restrictions and confidentiality terms. These agreements generally warrant that the software and proprietary hardware will materially comply with written documentation and assert that we own or have sufficient rights in the software we distribute and have not violated the intellectual property rights of others. We generally license our products in a format that does not permit users to change the software code.
While we employ many of our innovations exclusively in our own products and services, we also engage in outbound and inbound licensing of specific patented technologies. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, we believe, based on industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Markets, Competition, and Operations—For certain services, products, or components, including our cloud hosting operations, we rely on third-party providers, manufacturers, and partners, which may create significant exposure for us” under Item 1A of this report.
Trademarks and Service Marks
We use various trademarks and service marks to protect the marks used in our business. We also claim common law protections for other marks we use in our business. 
See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Information/Product Security and Intellectual Property—Our intellectual property may not be adequately protected” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Information/Product Security and Intellectual Property—Our products or other IP may infringe or may be alleged to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, which could lead to costly disputes or disruptions for us and may require us to indemnify our customers and resellers for any damages they suffer” under Item 1A of this report for a more detailed discussion regarding the risks associated with the protection of our intellectual property.
