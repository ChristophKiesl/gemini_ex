Our Business Segments
Overall, we believe we have a balanced portfolio of global professional services, digital solutions, and industry-leading technologies delivered across a wide government, defense and industrial base. Our business has been organized into three core and two non-core business segments as follows:
Core business segments
•Government Solutions
•Technology Solutions
•Energy Solutions
Non-core business segments
•Non-strategic Business
•Other
Our business segments are described below. 
Government Solutions ("GS"). Our GS business segment provides full life-cycle support solutions to defense, intelligence, space, aviation and other programs and missions for military and other government agencies in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. KBR services cover the full spectrum, from research and development, through systems engineering, test and evaluation, systems integration and program management, to operations support, readiness and logistics. With the acquisition of Centauri Holdings Platform, LLC ("Centauri") on October 1, 2020 (described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements), our GS business segment also provides software and engineering solutions to critical national security missions across space, cyber, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, missile defense and intelligence domains to the U.S. government and related defense agencies. 
Technology Solutions ("TS"). Our TS business segment combines KBR's sustainability-focused proprietary technologies, equipment and catalyst supply, digital solutions and associated knowledge-based services into a global business for refining, petrochemicals, inorganic and specialty chemicals as well as gasification, syngas, ammonia, nitric acid and fertilizers. Our TS business segment has led the way in the development of advanced digital and proprietary technologies, tools and solutions. From early planning through scope definition, advanced technologies and project life-cycle support, our TS business segment works closely with customers to provide an approach catered to their operational, financial and sustainability goals. Licensing and engineering/design services are typically provided during the front-end planning stage of both green- and brown-field capital projects, and proprietary equipment is delivered and installed as part of facility construction. Catalysts, or process consumables designed to drive process performance, efficiency and reliability, are delivered for start-up and are subsequently replenished, as needed.
Energy Solutions ("ES"). Our ES business segment provides full life-cycle support solutions across the upstream, midstream and downstream energy markets, including advisory services focused on energy transition and net-zero carbon objectives; technology-led industrial solutions focused on advanced remote operations capabilities to improve throughput, reliability and environmental sustainability; digitally-enabled professional services such as complex program management, engineering & design, and advanced project integration; and other construction services. 
Non-strategic Business. Our Non-strategic business segment represents the operations or activities deemed no longer core to our business strategy and that we have exited or intend to exit upon completion of existing contracts. As of December 31, 2020, all Non-strategic Business projects are substantially complete. Current activities in this business segment primarily relate to final project close-out, negotiation and settlement of claims, joint venture liquidation and various other matters associated with these projects.
Other. Our Other segment includes corporate expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses not allocated to the business segments above.
In 2020, we initiated a strategic transition from the current three-core business segment model to a two-core business segment model comprised of Government Solutions and Technology Solutions. We expect to begin reporting under this model in fiscal year 2021. The new Technology Solutions segment is anchored by our innovative, proprietary process technologies. It will also include our highly synergistic advisory practice focused on energy transition and net-zero carbon ambitions as well as our technology-led industrial solutions focused on innovative digital operations and maintenance (“O&M”) solutions and advanced remote operations capabilities to improve throughput, reliability and environmental sustainability. We believe that infusing high-end, sustainability expertise, client relationships and innovative, technology-led O&M solutions into Technology Solutions will increase resilience, generate new opportunities, simplify our business model and position us to deliver our offerings across a broader industrial base.
Significant Customers
We provide services to a diverse customer base, including domestic and foreign governments and commercial companies. 
We generate significant revenues within our GS business segment from key U.S. government customers including U.S. DoD and NASA, and from the U.K government. No other customers represented 10% or more of consolidated revenues in any of the periods presented. The following table summarizes our revenues from U.S. and U.K. government agencies.

Industry
Government Market Overview
The fiscal year 2021 U.S. defense budget funds a national security strategy that continues the restoration of military readiness, furthers a national security strategy to confront near peer and other threats around the world, enhances the DoD’s cybersecurity strategy and cyber warfare capabilities, increases the priority of military space superiority, and directs innovation to meet long-range emerging threats. The budget includes a number of measures to strengthen emerging technologies including cyber-science and technologies, artificial intelligence, directed energy, hypersonics, and biotechnologies.
Internationally, our Government Solutions work is performed primarily for the U.K. Ministry of Defence and the Australian Department of Defence. A significant majority of our work in the U.K. is contracted through long-term privately financed initiatives (PFIs) that are expected to provide stable, predictable earnings and cash flow over the program life, with our largest PFI extending through 2041. The Australian government continues to increase defense spending, with particular focus on enhancing regional security, modernizing defense capabilities, strengthening cyber defenses and promoting broader economic stability. 
With defense and civil budgets driven in part by political instability, military conflicts, aging platforms and infrastructure and the need for technology upgrades, we expect continued opportunities to provide solutions and technologies to mission critical work aligned with our customers’ priorities.
Commercial Market Overview
Long-range commercial market fundamentals are supported by global population growth, global expansion of the middle class, and acceleration of demand for energy transition and renewable energy sources for which momentum continues, even amidst COVID-19. Clients continue to prioritize investment in solutions to increase end-product flexibility and energy efficiency and reduce their environmental footprint. As companies continue to commit to near-term carbon neutrality and longer-range net-zero carbon ambitions, we expect their spending to continue in areas such as decarbonization; carbon capture, sequestration and utilization; biofuels; and plastics circular economy. Further, governments and leading companies across the world are proactively evaluating clean energy alternatives, including hydrogen and green ammonia, which are areas that favor KBR’s world-class technology portfolio and expertise.
We expect climate change and energy transition to be increasing areas of priority and investment for the Biden Administration and a more progressive Senate that holds a thin margin, as the U.S. looks to reboot its economy and invest in a cleaner future. President Biden has nominated two new cabinet-level positions focused on climate change and science. Further, through executive action, President Biden has initiated re-entry into the Paris climate accords and has begun the reversal of a number of the prior administration’s environmental policies.
Recent Developments
Centauri Acquisition
On October 1, 2020, we acquired Centauri Holdings Platform, LLC ("Centauri"), a provider of high-end engineering and development solutions for critical, well-funded, national security missions associated with space, intelligence, cyber, and emerging technologies such as directed energy and missile defense. The acquisition will expand KBR's military space and intelligence business and builds upon the Company's existing cybersecurity and missile defense solutions. Furthermore, the addition of Centauri advances KBR's strategic transformation of becoming a leading provider of high-end, mission-critical 
technical services and solutions. Additional information relating to the Centauri acquisition is described in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.
Significant Joint Ventures and Alliances
We enter into joint ventures and alliances with other reputable industry participants to capitalize on the strengths of each party and provide greater flexibility in delivering our services based on cost and geographical efficiency, increase the number of opportunities that can be pursued and reduce exposure and diversify risk. Our significant joint ventures and alliances are described below. All joint venture ownership percentages presented are stated as of December 31, 2020.
Aspire Defence is a joint venture currently owned by KBR and two financial investors to upgrade and provide a range of services to the British Army’s garrisons at Aldershot and around the Salisbury Plain in the U.K. We own a 45% interest in Aspire Defence that is accounted for within our GS business segment using the equity method of accounting. Prior to January 15, 2018, we held a 50% interest in the joint ventures that provide the construction and related support services to Aspire Defence, with the other 50% being owned by Carillion. On January 15, 2018, Carillion entered into compulsory liquidation and was excluded from future business and benefit from its interest in the joint ventures. As a result, KBR assumed operational management and control of these entities. KBR began consolidating the financial results of these entities in its financial statements effective January 15, 2018. On April 18, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Carillion's interests in the subcontracting entities.
In 2016, we established the Affinity joint venture with Elbit Systems Ltd. to procure, operate and maintain aircraft, and aircraft-related assets over an 18-year contract period, in support of the UKMFTS project. KBR owns a 50% interest in Affinity.  In addition, KBR owns a 50% interest in the two joint ventures, Affinity Capital Works and Affinity Flying Services, which provide procurement, operations and management support services under subcontracts with Affinity. The investments are accounted for within our GS business segment using the equity method of accounting. 
Brown & Root Industrial Services is a joint venture with Bernhard Capital Partners and offers maintenance services, turnarounds and small capital projects, primarily in North America. We own a 50% interest in this joint venture and account for this investment within our ES business segment using the equity method of accounting. 
Backlog of Unfulfilled Orders
Backlog is our estimate of the U.S. dollar amount of future revenues we expect to realize as a result of performing work on contracts. For projects within our unconsolidated joint ventures, we have included our percentage ownership of the joint venture’s estimated revenues in backlog to provide an indication of future work to be performed. The future revenues we expect to realize as a result of backlog was $15.1 billion and $14.6 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, with approximately 16% and 18%, respectively, related to work being executed by joint ventures accounted for using the equity method of accounting. We estimate that, as of December 31, 2020, 28% of our backlog will be recognized as revenues or equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates within fiscal year 2021. For additional information regarding backlog, see our discussion within “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our GS business segment primarily performs work under cost-reimbursable contracts in the U.S. with the DoD and other U.S. governmental agencies that are generally subject to applicable statutes and regulations. If the U.S. government concludes costs charged to a contract are not reimbursable under the terms of the contract or applicable procurement regulations, these costs are disallowed or, if already reimbursed, we may be required to refund the reimbursed amounts to the customer. Such conditions may also include interest and other financial penalties. If performance issues arise under any of our government contracts, the customer retains the right to pursue remedies, which could include termination under any affected contract. Generally, our customers have the contractual right to terminate or reduce the amount of work under our contracts at any time. For more information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” contained in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our GS business segment also participates in PFI contracts, such as the Aspire Defence and UKMFTS projects. PFIs are long-term contracts that outsource the responsibility for the construction, procurement, financing, operation and maintenance of government-owned assets to the private sector. These contracts may contain both fixed-price and cost-reimbursable elements. The PFI projects in which KBR participates are all located in the U.K. with contractual terms ranging from 15 to 35 years, and involve the provision of services to various types of assets ranging from acquisition and maintenance of major military equipment and housing to transportation infrastructure. Under most of these PFI contracts, the primary deliverables of the contracting entity are the initial construction or procurement of assets for the customer and the subsequent provision of operations and maintenance services related to the assets once they are transferred and ready for their intended use. The amount 
of renumeration from the customer to the contracting entity is negotiated on each contract and varies depending on the specific terms for each PFI. 
Contracts
Our contracts broadly consist of fixed-price, cost-reimbursable or a combination of the two. Our fixed-price contracts may include cost escalation and other features that allow for increases in price should certain events occur or conditions change. Fixed-price contracts are typically subject to change orders if the scope of work changes or unforeseen conditions arise resulting in adjustments to the fixed price. 
Fixed-price contracts include both lump-sum and unit-rate contracts. Under lump-sum contracts, we perform a defined scope of work for a specified fee to cover all costs and any profit element. Lump-sum contracts entail significant risk to us because they require us to predetermine the work to be performed, the project execution schedule and all the costs associated with the scope of work. Unit-rate contracts are essentially fixed-price contracts with the only variable being units of work to be performed. Although fixed-price contracts involve greater risk than cost-reimbursable contracts, they also are potentially more profitable because the owner/customer pays a premium to transfer project risks to us.
Cost-reimbursable contracts include cost-plus fixed fee, cost-plus fixed rate, and time and materials contracts. Under cost-reimbursable contracts, the price is generally variable based upon our actual costs incurred for materials, equipment, reimbursable labor hours and in some cases, overhead and general and administrative expenses. Profit on cost-reimbursable contracts may be in the form of a fixed fee or a mark-up applied to costs incurred, or a combination of the two. The fee may also be an incentive fee based on performance indicators, milestones or targets and can be based on customer discretion. Cost-reimbursable contracts may also provide for a guaranteed maximum price where the total fee plus the total cost cannot exceed an agreed upon guaranteed maximum price. Cost overruns or costs associated with project delays could be our responsibility under such contracts. Cost-reimbursable contracts are generally less risky than fixed-price contracts because the owner/customer retains many of the project risks. 
Raw Materials and Suppliers
Equipment and materials essential to our business are obtained from a variety of global sources. The principal equipment and materials we use in our business are subject to availability and price fluctuations due to customer demand, producer capacity and market conditions. We monitor the availability and price of equipment and materials on a regular basis. Our procurement function seeks to leverage our size and buying power to ensure that we have access to key equipment and materials at low prices and ideal delivery schedules. While we do not currently foresee any significant lack of availability of equipment and materials in the near term, the availability of these items may vary significantly from year to year and any prolonged unavailability or significant price increases for equipment and materials necessary to our projects and services could have a material adverse effect on our business. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” contained in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
Intellectual Property
The use of intellectual property generally benefits our TS and ES business segments. We have developed, acquired or otherwise have the right to license leading technologies, including technologies held under license from third parties, used for the production of a variety of petrochemicals and chemicals and in the areas of olefins, refining, fertilizers, coal gasification, semi-submersibles and specialty chemicals. We also license a variety of technologies for the transformation of raw materials into commodity chemicals such as phenol used in the production of consumer end products. In addition, we are a licensor of ammonia process technologies used in the conversion of natural gas to ammonia with a fully developed, proprietary, end-to-end green ammonia solution K-GreeNTM. We also offer technologies for crystallization and evaporation, concentration and purification of strong inorganic acids, as well as an innovative, disruptive mixed plastics recycling technology that processes all types of plastic including many that are considered by some to be unrecyclable. We believe our technology portfolio and experience in the commercial application of these technologies and our related know-how differentiates us, enables our sustainability strategy, and enhances our margins and encourages customers to utilize our broad range of EPC and construction services.
Our rights to make use of technologies licensed to us are governed by written agreements of varying durations, including some with fixed terms that are subject to renewal based on mutual agreement. Generally, each agreement may be further extended and we have historically been able to renew existing agreements before they expire. We expect these and other 
similar agreements to be extended so long as it is mutually advantageous to both parties at the time of renewal. For technologies we own, we protect our rights, know-how and trade secrets through patents and confidentiality agreements.
Seasonality
Our operations are not generally affected by seasonality. However, weather and natural phenomena can temporarily affect the performance of our services.
Environmental Regulation
Our business involves planning, design, program management, construction and construction management, and operations and maintenance at various project sites throughout the world, including oil field and related energy infrastructure construction services, in and around sensitive environmental areas, such as rivers, lakes and wetlands. Our operations may require us to manage, handle, remove, treat, transport and dispose of toxic or hazardous substances, which are subject to stringent and complex laws relating to the protection of the environment and prevention of pollution.
Significant fines, penalties and other sanctions may be imposed for non-compliance with environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations, and some laws provide for joint and several strict liabilities for remediation of releases of hazardous substances, rendering a person liable for environmental damage, without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person. These laws and regulations may expose us to liability arising out of the conduct of operations or conditions caused by others, or for our acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these acts were performed. For example, there are a number of governmental laws that strictly regulate the handling, removal, treatment, transportation and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, and comparable national and state laws that impose strict, joint and several liabilities for the entire cost of cleanup, without regard to whether a company knew of or caused the release of hazardous substances. In addition, some environmental regulations can impose liability for the entire clean-up on owners, operators, transporters and other persons arranging for the treatment or disposal of such hazardous substances costs related to contaminated facilities or project sites. Other environmental laws applicable to our and customers' operations affecting us include, but are not limited to, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act as well as other comparable foreign and state laws. Liabilities related to environmental contamination or human exposure to hazardous substances, comparable foreign and state laws or a failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial costs to us, including cleanup costs, fines, civil or criminal sanctions, third-party claims for property damage, personal injury or cessation of remediation activities.
Additional information relating to environmental regulations is described in "Item 1A. Risk Factors” contained in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.
Compliance
We prioritize conducting our business with ethics and integrity. We are subject to numerous compliance-related laws and regulations, including the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act, other applicable anti-bribery legislation and laws and regulations regarding trade and exports. The services we provide to the U.S. federal government are subject to the FAR, the Truth in Negotiations Act, CAS, the Services Contract Act, DoD security regulations, and many other laws and regulations. These laws and regulations affect how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. We are also governed by our own Code of Business Conduct (our "Code") and other compliance-related corporate policies and procedures that mandate compliance with these laws. Our Code is a guide for every employee in applying legal and ethical practices to our everyday work. In particular, our Code describes our standards of integrity and relevant principles and areas of law most likely to affect our business. We regularly train our employees regarding our Code and other specific areas including anti-bribery compliance and international trade compliance.
Human Capital Management
At KBR, we bring together the best and brightest to deliver technology and solutions that help our customers accomplish their most critical missions and objectives. In doing so, we strive to create a better, safer and more sustainable world.  In 2020, we capitalized on momentum KBR had been building over the past several years and began to reimagine how we deliver. This transformational journey has culminated in the development of our new One KBR values, which capture who we are and guide everything we do. The values have at their core our focus on people — our customers, our stakeholders, our communities and our employees — and our commitment to delivering unrivaled solutions and expertise. 
Our new One KBR Values are:
•We Value Our People
•We Deliver
•We Are People of Integrity
•We Empower
•We are a Team of Teams 
Of these, the core value that embodies our approach to human capital management is We Value Our People:
Our people are the heart of everything we do. We are dedicated to creating diverse and inclusive work environments, in which every member of our team of teams feels safe, supported, respected, trusted and valued, and where each person is given opportunities to grow and reach their full potential. 
Our employees’ expertise, domain knowledge and leadership capability enable KBR to provide superior science, technology and engineering solutions and in 2020 we renewed our global people strategy to enable KBR to harness the power of all our people, by:
•Building our reputation as a great place to work;
•Creating the conditions in which people can flourish;
•Capitalizing on their tremendous capability; and
•Together, helping realize the potential of One KBR
Our 29,000 employees perform diverse, complex, mission critical roles, in 40 countries, and we continue to embed the best people practices to support their experience as an employee, underpinned by our ongoing commitment to Zero Harm. 
Worker Health and Safety / Zero Harm
We are subject to numerous worker health and safety laws and regulations. In the U.S., these laws and regulations include the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state legislation, the Mine Safety and Health Administration laws, and safety requirements of the Departments of State, Defense, Energy and Transportation of the U.S. government. We are also subject to similar requirements in other countries in which we have extensive operations, including the U.K. where we are subject to the various regulations enacted by the Health and Safety Act of 1974. These laws and regulations are frequently changing, and it is impossible to predict the effect of such laws and regulations on us in the future.
Our global Zero Harm culture rests on nine key principles, which we refer to as our “sustainability pillars.” The central pillar is “Courage to Care,” which we define as the willingness to intervene when one observes something that does not meet acceptable standards. We believe our Zero Harm culture has resulted in a work environment that promotes employee engagement and ownership. Although we have experienced significant improvement in our safety performance indicators, we cannot guarantee that our efforts will always be successful and from time to time we may experience incidents or unsafe work conditions or practices may arise. Our project sites often put our employees and others in proximity with mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, chemical and manufacturing processes, and highly regulated materials. Additionally, our employees and others at certain project sites may be exposed to severe weather events or high security risks. We actively seek to maintain a safe, healthy and environmentally sound workplace for all of our employees and those who work with us. Consequently, we may incur substantial costs to maintain the safety and security of our personnel in these locations.
COVID-19
During 2020, our Zero Harm culture was epitomized in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, where our response prioritized taking action for the safety of our people, families and customers and to do our part to slow the spread of the virus. We activated a special executive task force in January 2020 to monitor and respond to developments in real time, implementing travel restrictions to protect our people and customers, alongside practical, accessible training and support, including resources available through our Employee Assistance Program. We quickly deployed local emergency response plans and continued to operate throughout the year to enable employees working remotely or on site to continue to deliver the same outstanding service and attention to our customers.
Reimagining How We Deliver
This pivot to remote work allowed our employees to maintain a high level of productivity and efficiency while transitioning to new ways of working, and gave us the chance to reimagine how we deliver as a more flexible, agile business, where our people, operating model and culture enable rapid change and value creation, and establish a source of competitive advantage. A global task force was established to reimagine our culture, work practices and workplaces, resulting in what we believe will be sustainable changes with clear benefits, including offering more flexible working arrangements to help establish KBR as a global employer of choice and support a more diverse workforce.

To support the transition to this new work environment, we ran a series of virtual training events focused on the skills required by employees and managers in this new world and held regular ‘virtual coffees’ with experts and leaders in KBR to help our people stay connected as part of an adaptable network and reinforce our Team of Teams ethos. Enhancement to our workplaces, upgrades to our flexible working policy and easy access to digital tools and resources have all contributed to our new ways of working.
Mental Health & Fitness
We recognize that mental health and wellbeing affect everyone, and during the pandemic this has proved even more critical. Building on our commitment to Zero Harm, we aim to create a workplace where employees can thrive, and to inspire and enable our employees to proactively improve their own mental fitness.

During 2020, we established a global Mental Health & Wellbeing Committee to help steer our strategy and to give our people the support and resources they need. We have raised awareness and encouraged conversations about mental health and fitness through ongoing communications, including webinars with KBR and external experts, supported by highly visible leadership. A broad range of training and support materials were made available to employees and managers, and we upgraded our Employee Assistance Program to provide free counselling, advice and resources for employees and their families in multiple languages.

Over the year, we developed further plans to help employees improve their mental fitness and resilience, including access to themed training and resources, provision of bespoke management training, global expansion of our Wellbeing Ambassadors program, and launch of a new mobile application providing employees with 24/7 access to a personalized mental health and wellbeing platform, which we expect to formally launch in 2021. 
Hiring the Best and Brightest 
In 2020, we hired over 8,000 new employees, the majority of whom were appointed utilizing innovative virtual selection processes during the COVID-19 pandemic through proactive promotion of our employer brand using social media, supplemented by targeted campaigns for specialist expertise, with a particular focus on sourcing diverse applicants to reflect the communities in which we operate. 
Our onboarding process helps new hires quickly become effective and develop a strong sense of belonging, equipped with the right tools and support to enable them to perform. With virtual onboarding a new reality, we have enhanced our processes to include digital welcome packs which promote our employee-centric culture. 
During 2020, we began to refresh our Employee Value Proposition ("EVP"), putting purpose at the heart of our employer brand. KBR offers fulfilling careers to the best and brightest people, and we empower our employees to work in ways that work for them. We are researching how our internal and external perceptions match up to that promise, which will inform how we articulate, promote and measure our employer brand in the future. 
Inclusion & Diversity
We established a new Inclusion & Diversity ("I&D") Council early in 2020, representing a cross-section of employees from different markets, businesses and functions, to review, assess and champion initiatives which support our inclusion and diversity journey. We have set out a comprehensive I&D strategy with the goal of becoming a magnet for diverse talent, where we are known for a culture of belonging and equality, and adopted a program to inform our practices on hiring, developing, engaging and rewarding diverse talent. The I&D Council’s first set of recommendations, which focused on hiring, training and education, are now being implemented through our global Human Resources ("HR") community and business leadership teams.
Women represented 23.4% of KBR’s workforce as of December 31, 2020, a slight increase from 22.6% as of December 31, 2019, and we continue to consider gender diversity in our recruiting and hiring process. In 2020 we also conducted a systematic review of gender pay equity and monitored the gender balance among new hires and leavers, and were pleased to confirm we found no indication of bias in our reward structures or headcount trends. 
Moving forward, we are accelerating our focus on diversity into other areas, with a particular emphasis on race and ethnicity, and the I&D Council will be researching and recommending continual improvements in this important area. The team will also be reviewing our internal targets and using data to track lead indicators and performance outcomes.
Employee Resource Groups
Over the year, we have continued to support and engage with our Employee Resource Groups ("ERGs"), which together form a valuable network across KBR to educate, advocate and connect people with common interests. The primary ERG focused on I&D is ASPIRE, which has been an established employee network and support group for more than five years and conducts events across the world, regularly attended by hundreds of participants. In 2020, a new Pride & Allies ERG was launched, and we also plan to provide ERG support for Working Parents and Caregivers. Looking forward, we are planning to bring all our I&D related ERGs together under a global umbrella which supports all diverse populations and champions inclusion across KBR.
For our early career professionals, we sponsor IMPACT, an ERG focused on talent development, which helps employees through networking, continuing education, and mutual support. In 2020, we launched the IMPACT Vision Series of webinars, focused on the science, technology and engineering behind KBR’s strategy and solutions, with attendance typically over 800 for each event, and we plan to build on this momentum as we support the growth of IMPACT in 2021. 
Talent Development & Succession
As part of our overall talent development strategy we continue to focus on succession planning for critical roles, including the Executive Leadership Team and Chief Executive Officer, and engage regularly with the Board on these topics. In addition to identifying potential successors, in 2020 we also introduced a robust talent review process, which calibrates performance and potential for our leadership team and ensures appropriate action plans are in place to prepare our next level of talent for the challenges and opportunities ahead. We have plans in place to cascade this talent calibration process to the next level during 2021, bringing greater visibility and breadth to succession planning for other key roles.
KBR provides targeted learning and development opportunities, such as our Global Leadership Development Program, through which nominees develop their strategic thinking and executive leadership skills. The current participants in this program have undertaken a range of challenging business projects during 2020, alongside skills development, coaching and networking events. 
In addition to such tailored programs and processes, all KBR employees can participate in a wide range of learning and development activities. Our learning management system provides access to thousands of modules, podcasts, articles and videos, spanning technical, behavioral and regulatory training requirements. 
Employee Engagement
We evaluate our success in making KBR a great place to work, in part, by whether our employees choose to stay with us, and in 2020 we were pleased to note a reduction in voluntary turnover. While we are confident that this reflects our ongoing efforts to increase employee engagement, we recognize that the reduction is also due to labor market dynamics, and in particular the uncertainty caused by COVID-19. 
We closely monitor our employees’ engagement and satisfaction, undertaking pulse surveys and routinely conducting exit interviews to learn from their experience. During 2020, we began crowdsourcing real-time feedback from employees using digital polling platforms as part of our virtual events, which helped generate honest, anonymous feedback and ideas on a wide range of topics related to their experience as employees as well as our business overall. 
As we refresh our EVP, we plan to build on our local survey processes and establish a global employee survey, which will also encapsulate feedback on inclusion and diversity, mental health and wellbeing, and our One KBR Values. This will be a fundamental building block to help us hire great people that can do great things that matter to the world.
