 Item 1. Business
 Zix® (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a leading cloud provider of email security, productivity and compliance solutions. Trusted by the nation’s most influential institutions in healthcare, finance and government, Zix delivers a superior experience and easy-to-use solutions for email encryption, data loss prevention (“DLP”), advanced threat protection, unified archiving, and cloud data backup. As a leading provider of cloud-based cybersecurity, compliance, and productivity solutions for businesses of all sizes, we are focused on the protection of business communication, enabling our customers to better secure data and meet compliance needs. We serve organizations in many industries, with particular emphasis on the healthcare (including multiple major hospitals and several Blue Cross Blue Shield plans), financial services (including several major U.S. Banks), and insurance and government (including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”)) sectors. 
 Our email encryption and DLP capabilities enable the secure exchange of email that includes sensitive information. Through a comprehensive secure messaging service, called Email Encryption (formerly ZixEncrypt), we allow an enterprise to use policy-driven rules to determine which email messages should be sent securely or quarantined for review to comply with regulations or company-defined policies. 
 The main differentiation for Email Encryption in the marketplace is our exceptional ease of use. The best example of this is our ability to provide transparent delivery of encrypted email. Most email encryption solutions are focused on the sender. They typically introduce an added burden on recipients, often requiring additional user authentication with the creation of a new user identity and password. We designed our solution to alleviate the recipient’s burden by enabling the delivery of encrypted email automatically and transparently. Zix enables transparent delivery through (1) The Directory (formerly ZixDirectory®), an email encryption community which is designed to share identities of our tens of millions of members, (2) Zix’s patented Best Method of Delivery®, which is designed to deliver email in the most secure, most convenient method possible for the recipient, and (3) policy-based encryption, which automatically encrypts and decrypts messages with sensitive content. Our Email Encryption also addresses a business’s greatest source of data loss – corporate email – with an easy, straightforward DLP approach. By focusing strictly on the risks of email, Email Encryption simplifies DLP in comparison to other DLP solutions by decreasing complexity and cost, reducing deployment time and minimizing impact on customer resources and workflow. 
 Our Email Encryption solution enables DLP capabilities for email by combining proven policy and content scanning capabilities with quarantine functionality. The quarantine system and its intuitive interface allow administrators to (1) easily define policies and create custom lexicons for quarantining email messages, (2) conveniently manage quarantined messages using flexible searching and filtering options, (3) release or delete individual or multiple quarantined messages with one click, (4) review reports that monitor quarantine activities and trends and (5) automate custom notifications informing employees of quarantined messages.
            In March 2017, Zix acquired Greenview Data, Inc. (“Greenview”), an email security company. Zix’s acquisition of Greenview addresses increasing buyer demand for email security bundles by adding advanced threat protection, antivirus, anti-spam and archiving capabilities to its industry-leading email encryption. Greenview was a good fit for Zix’s business based on its employees’ expertise in email security and its emphasis on customer success, which align with Zix’s reputation for delivering industry-leading solutions and a superior experience.
 Through the acquisition of Greenview, Zix launched two new solutions in April 2017 – ZixProtectSM and ZixArchiveSM. ZixProtect is now called Advanced Email Threat Protection while ZixArchive is now called Information Archive.  Advanced Email Threat Protection defends organizations from zero-day malware, ransomware, phishing, CEO fraud, W-2 phishing attacks, spam and viruses in email with multi-layer filtering techniques. Accuracy in protecting organizations from email threats is increased further with automated traffic analysis, machine learning and real-time threat analysis.  The solution is available as a cloud-based service in a variety of bundles.  Information Archive is a low-cost, cloud-based email retention solution that easily enables user retrieval, compliance and eDiscovery. Available as a standalone or add-on solution for other products, Zix’s Information Archive includes policy-based retention, automatic indexing and flexible search capabilities for audit and legal requirements. With on-demand access through the cloud, organizations can conveniently share messages with employees, auditors and outside consultants or legal counsel, as well as revoke access when needed. 
 In April 2018, Zix acquired Erado, a unified archiving company. Erado strengthened Zix’s comprehensive archiving solutions with unified archiving, supervision, security, and messaging solutions for customers that demand bundled services. Erado’s long- standing focus on helping its customers comply with FINRA and SEC regulations helped further strengthen Zix’s offerings for customers with compliance requirements. This acquisition also expanded Zix’s cloud-based email archiving capabilities into more than 50 content channels, including social media, instant message, mobile, web, audio and video.

On February 20, 2019, Zix acquired AppRiver, a leading provider of cloud-based cybersecurity solutions for Small and Medium Businesses (“SMB”).  The combined company creates one of the leading cloud-based security solutions providers, particularly for the small and mid-size enterprise market. This acquisition further strengthened that alignment by bolstering our Advanced Threat Protection offerings, expanding our go-to-market channels, and providing a stronger cloud platform to drive even more value for our customers and partners.  In addition, we now can directly offer Microsoft’s substantial catalog of productivity and Microsoft Office 365 cloud email solutions.  
 On May 7, 2019, Zix acquired DeliverySlip, expanding our portfolio with additional email encryption, information rights management, e-signatures, and secure file sharing solutions. 
 On November 5, 2020, Zix acquired CloudAlly, a pioneer of enterprise-grade, software-as-a-service (SaaS) cloud backup and recovery solutions. CloudAlly provides a secure cloud data backup solution for critical business information, including backup services for Microsoft O365 cloud email, Google applications, and Salesforce.  
 Our business operations and service offerings are supported by the ZixData Center™, which is ISO 27001 certified SOC2 accredited and SOC 3 certified for applicable services. The operations of the ZixData Center are independently audited annually to maintain ISO 27001 certification covering numerous categories and controls and AICPA SOC3 certification in the areas of security, confidentiality, integrity and availability. Auditors also produce a SOC2 report on the effectiveness of operational controls used over the audit period.  
 Our company was incorporated as a corporation in Texas in 1988. Originally named Amtech Corporation, we changed our name to ZixIt® Corporation in 1999 when we entered the encrypted email market. In 2002, we became Zix Corporation, and in 2017, the Company rebranded to Zix.
 Overview
 Security, productivity, and compliance of business communication is critical in today’s highly connected environment. Companies are deploying more devices, communicating on more channels, and enabling more remote work, all while facing more sophisticated security threats. The key to enabling companies to thrive in this dynamic environment is a secure modern workplace that protects business communication and continuity from on-premises to cloud-based services. Through the Secure Cloud platform, Zix provides email encryption, DLP, advanced threat protection, unified archiving, and cloud data backup services. This combination of cloud-based security and compliance services is further combined with Microsoft’s cloud-based productivity tools within the Secure Cloud extensible platform to provide companies with the secure modern workplace they need to meet the challenges of today.
 Many security threats begin with email. Zix Email Threat Protection secures this key vulnerability in a way that’s straightforward to implement and manage. Our Email Threat Protection provides multilayered filtering that permits legitimate email while blocking malicious threats such as phishing, impersonation, malware, ransomware, and spam-type messages—all automatically. By using advanced threat protection capabilities such as machine learning, attachment sandboxing/disarm, link rewriting and time-of-click analysis, Zix protects business email from the evolving threat landscape. 
 
Protecting email also means protecting sensitive business data in email communication. Once email leaves the secure business network environment, it can be intercepted, redirected, manipulated or exposed to unauthorized parties. Failure to control and manage such risks can result in enforcement penalties for noncompliance under numerous regulations, in addition to damaged reputation, competitive disadvantage, a loss of intellectual property or other corporate assets, exposure to negligence or liability claims, and diversion of resources to repair such damage. For example, healthcare organizations, business associates and sub-contractors are subject to the Privacy, Security, and Enforcement Rules of the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) enacted in 1996, and as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH Act”) enacted in 2009. Financial institutions are subject to data privacy laws including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) enacted in 1999. These U.S. federal laws help drive the use of encrypted email. In addition, individual states and foreign countries have enacted privacy laws requiring the safeguard of personal data, and almost all states encourage email encryption by allowing exemptions from data breach notification laws.

Our Email Encryption Service allows a user to send encrypted email to any email user anywhere and on any Internet-enabled device. Encrypted email is delivered through the patented Best Method of Delivery protocol which automatically determines the most direct and appropriate means of delivery, based on the sender’s and recipient’s communications environment and preferences. Our Best Method of Delivery makes the technology simple for end users and provides flexibility and ease of implementation for information technology professionals. We believe the ability to send messages through different modes of delivery is one of many differentiators that makes our Email Encryption Service superior to competitive offerings.
 Zix Email Encryption also includes our unique email data loss prevention capabilities that automatically detect sensitive data using our industry leading pre-built filters that cover many of today’s industry regulations including HIPAA, GLBA, and state privacy laws. Zix also provides the ability to build new custom filters to meet the needs of any business. Additionally, customers can define policies to determine what should be done when sensitive information is found. This can include blocking, routing, encrypting or quarantining the email. When quarantined, users and authorized administrators can review the violations to determine appropriate action.
 Zix Information Archive solution provides additional compliance protection, archiving not only email communication but all types of business communication including, instant messaging, chat, social media, web and much more. The ability to collect various forms of digital business communication into a centralized archive and then easily search and collect data is critical for organizations in both regulated and non-regulated industries. Zix also provides advanced supervisory capabilities for highly regulated companies and enables the digital sharing of eDiscovery results with outside auditors and legal counsel. 
 
A comprehensive data protection plan is more important than ever as companies around the world are focusing on cybersecurity, particularly for their remote workforce. To help companies address this, Zix has added a Cloud Data Backup service through the acquisition of CloudAlly. Our Cloud Data Backup enables the secure backup and recovery of cloud services such as Microsoft Office 365 and Sharepoint, Google Workspace, Salesforce, Dropbox and more. Our backup and recovery capabilities include automated or on-demand backup and non-destructive restore.
 
Zix also enables both customers and partners to manage their Zix security and compliance services through our world-class Secure Cloud platform. Secure Cloud provides a centralized management platform where Zix services can be accessed. As a true multi-tenant environment, partners can add services and manage their customers, while integrating Secure Cloud with their own back office systems. 
 
By combining our solutions, as well as selling Microsoft productivity and email solutions, Zix makes it possible for customers to build a secure modern workplace that protects their business communication. Zix provides security, productivity and compliance in an easy to implement and manage cloud service. 
 Competition
 The most significant differentiators for Zix as compared with our competition is ease of use and exceptional support. We are best known for our superior ease of use with transparent delivery of encrypted email messages. We are able to deliver transparent email encryption as a result of The Directory and Best Method of Delivery capabilities of our Email Encryption. The Directory is a global “white pages” enabling transparent secure communications with other Email Encryption customers using our centralized key management system and overall unique approach to implementing encrypted email. Our patented Best Method of Delivery (BMOD) automatically identifies the best method of encrypting an email to provide the highest security and ease-of-use to each user. BMOD can deliver encrypted email using a variety of encrypt technologies including S/MIME, TLS, “push” delivery and secure portal “pull” delivery mechanisms.
 
Our exceptional support is another area that differentiates Zix from the competition. Zix focuses on ensuring every step of the experience for both customers and partners is smooth and easy. For example, new customers are provided with white glove treatment to ensure their initial implementation and setup goes smoothly. Customers also have direct access to our threat analysts to obtain help, which provides peace of mind as the threat landscape evolves. Customers have access to Zix via phone or email night-and-day to address any questions or concerns. 
 
We view our primary competitors in the email security space to be Proofpoint, Mimecast, and Barracuda Networks. Technically, while these companies also offer advanced threat protection, encrypted email and archiving, we believe that Zix offers superior customer service and ease-of-use not matched by the competition. Nevertheless, some of these competitors are large enterprises with substantial financial and technical resources that exceed ours. We are also competing against (a) other value-added cloud distributor platforms such as PAX8, Datto, and Sherweb; and (b) other providers with product offerings that compete with products in our portfolio such as Virtru (known for email encryption), Agari (known for threat protection), Smarsh (known for archive), and Veeam (known for cloud data backup).  In addition, while our products provide an additional layer of protection, some customers settle for the email security features and customer support offered by Microsoft for its Office 365 email solution.

Regulatory Drivers
 We have been successful in securing market penetration in our target vertical markets of healthcare, finance services and government primarily due to regulations that address the need for data privacy and security.
 In addition to the need to protect personal data and sensitive business communication, demand for email security in the healthcare sector, including business associates of healthcare providers, is augmented by regulatory requirements under HIPAA and HITECH Act. The Privacy and Security rules under those acts provide severe penalties for violations, including strict breach notification requirements, and allow states to pursue HIPAA violations. In the financial services industry, financial institutions and their service providers are subject to the GLBA, which is enforced by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”). The FTC has issued guidance saying that businesses that transmit sensitive data by email should ensure that data is encrypted. 
 
Expanded privacy regulations at the state-level and in international jurisdictions, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), serve as additional regulatory drivers for our product offerings.
 In choosing an email security provider, companies are influenced by the solutions chosen by their regulators. Our customers include the federal regulators in the FFIEC as well as state banking regulators. Our service has been a recommended solution of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, whose members regulate state-chartered banks across the U.S.
 Sales and Marketing
 We sell our email encryption, DLP, advanced threat protection, unified archiving, and cloud data backup services through a direct sales force that focuses on larger businesses and a telesales force that focuses on small to medium-sized accounts. We also use a network of resellers and other distribution partners, including other managed service providers (“MSP”) seeking security, productivity, and compliance offerings. Approximately 76% of our new business transacted in 2020 resulted from our partner relationships. As of December 31, 2020, we had nearly 5,000 monthly transacting MSP partners. 
Research and Development 
 We incurred research and development (“R&D”) expenses of $22.8 million, $20.4 million, and $11.3 million for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
 Over the course of 2020, we continued to make investments toward strengthening and expanding our platform and service portfolio. We completed initial development of and introduced the Secure Cloud multi-tenant infrastructure with fully integrated new and refreshed versions of encryption, unified archiving, secure file sharing, and advanced threat protection. We released a new Microsoft Teams connection for use with the Archiving subsystem. We integrated into Secure Cloud Comprehensive Reporting, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), Professional Services Automation (PSA) interface provisioning capabilities and Mailbox Security Auditing. We designed service components to be flexibly configured and integrated with productivity services, such as Microsoft Office 365 mailboxes or offered separately. The closing months of the year saw us working on features related to expansion efforts, such as enabling multiple languages support and data residency outside of the US.
 
This year, we also developed Advanced Email Encryption for Secure Cloud, providing the full best-in-class suite of Zix Encryption features to Secure Cloud including our next-generation cloud-native multi-tenant DLP Quarantine service. Advanced Email Encryption provides senders and supervisors detailed information about policy decisions which caused an email to encrypt, helping promote compliance awareness and flagging potential compliance issues. It is designed to work seamlessly with other Security, Compliance, and Productivity Secure Cloud subsystems, with a focus on ease of provisioning.
 
Over the closing months of the year, we developed reusable design constructs that connect Secure Cloud with legacy Zix Encryption services.  This creates a path for our loyal encryption customers to add new Secure Cloud capabilities through a single management interface that requires minimal service support engagement. We began developing a new, distributed Enterprise Bus backbone for Secure Cloud that promises to link future Lifecycle Management, Customer Tech Touch, Distributed Learning and Business Intelligence, Data Warehouse and other advanced service intelligence functions by way of an API-enabled open architecture.

Intellectual Property 
 We depend upon our ability to develop, maintain and protect our proprietary technology and our related intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology and related property rights and to defend against infringement and/or misappropriation claims from others. As of December 31, 2020, we owned 48 U.S. patents with various expiration dates through 2036, and 10 pending U.S. applications. We have a program to file applications for and obtain patents and trademarks in the United States and in specific foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. While intellectual property rights are generally important to our business, we do not believe that our business is dependent on any single item of intellectual property, or that any single item of intellectual property is material to the operation of our business. Rather, we believe that our intellectual property rights provide us with a competitive advantage, and from time to time we have taken steps to enforce our intellectual property rights as a means of protecting that competitive advantage.
 Our Company and certain of our subsidiaries are the owners of trademarks and service marks registered with the United States Patent & Trademark Office. These marks are renewable indefinitely, contingent upon continued use and payment of applicable renewal fees. Additionally, our Company and certain of our subsidiaries own several pending trademark applications with the United States Patent & Trademark Office as well as a number of United States common law trademarks, several service marks and trademarks and service marks registered in foreign countries. We consider our trademark and service marks as valuable assets of the Company due to their recognition by our customers. We are not aware of any valid claims of infringement or challenges to our right to use any of our trademarks or service marks in the United States.
 Please see generally the risks that are more fully disclosed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for risks related to our intellectual property. 
 Human Capital
          As of December 31, 2020, we had 543 employees. The majority of our employees are located in Gulf Breeze, Florida and Dallas, Texas. Our employees and our culture are a critical component of the success of Zix. We continually invest in our global workforce. The Company’s key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop the highest quality talent and put them in a position to do their best work. To support these objectives, the Company’s human resources programs are designed to recruit and develop talent to prepare them for future roles and leadership positions.  We strive to reward and support employees through competitive pay, benefit, and perquisite programs.  We work to improve the Company’s culture to create a high-performing, diverse workforce. We believe that engaged employees are a key element that differentiates Zix in the market. It is our employees who provide solutions for our partners and customers that empower them as they work to enable secure, compliant workplaces for their customers and employees. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 543 full-time employees located globally, of which approximately 92% were located in the United States and 8% were in our international locations.
          Fostering a work environment that is culturally diverse, inclusive and equitable is a major focus for us. While we have made progress, we still have more work to do. We have a four-pronged strategy to become more diverse over time by (1) attracting diverse talent , (2) onboarding and integrating new hires through our orientation program, which informs new hires how we are a caring, learning and results driven organization, (3) providing training to create an inclusive learning-oriented workplace for all employees, and (4) providing development programs for all colleagues with a focus on professional career growth and mentorship opportunities.
 
       We care about the health and well-being of our employees and their families. We offer a broad package of employment benefits including comprehensive health insurance, competitive leave and paid time-off policies, and retirement support. Employees have access to a host of other benefits related to mental health, fitness, and other facets of employee care. We also provide qualified employees an education stipend and reimbursements for schooling, training, and obtaining certifications. In addition, we have a program for formally recognizing and providing a monetary award to employees who file new U.S. patents.  
 
     In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees as well as the communities in which we operate. This includes enabling the vast majority of our employees to work from home and enhancing a number of capabilities to support them through the challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. These enhancements include offering flexible schedules, providing equipment and supplies for home office use, and work-life balance adjustments for those with young children or other dependents at home.

Compliance with Environmental Regulations
 We have a governance process for identifying and managing environmental risks and opportunities, including climate related risks and opportunities. Given the nature of our business and operations, we have not incurred, and do not expect to incur, any material expenditures or obligations related to environmental compliance issues.
Governmental Contracts
 We have contracts with many local, state and federal agencies and regulators, which in the aggregate contributed approximately 3% of our annual revenue in 2020.
 Significant Customers
 In each of 2020, 2019, and 2018, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues.
 Backlog 
 Our backlog is comprised of contractual commitments that we expect to recognize as revenue in the future. Our backlog was $83.4 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $89.4 million at December 31, 2019.
 As of December 31, 2020, our backlog is comprised of the following elements: $41.5 million of deferred revenue that has been billed and paid, $12.9 million billed but unpaid, and approximately $29.0 million of unbilled contracts. The decline in backlog resulted from the shortening of the average term of our contracts from a multi-year to an annual commitment or to a monthly billing and subscription model.
 The backlog is recognized into revenue ratably as the services are performed. Approximately 75% of our total backlog at December 31, 2020, is expected to be recognized as revenue during the next twelve months.
 Seasonality
 The Company typically experiences less new business in the first quarter of the calendar year. Our annual budget anticipates this in our forecasting of the first quarter, but historically this has not resulted in a material impact to our revenue or earnings on a seasonal basis. The first quarter typically includes a slight decline in profitability and cash flow for the Company, as our first quarter includes increases in cost associated with payroll taxes, sales and marketing investments for the year and timing of the payment of the Company’s annual bonus program and retention bonuses associated with our acquisitions. 
Geographic Information
 Our operations are primarily based in the U.S., with approximately 8% of our employees located internationally, predominantly in Israel, Canada and the United Kingdom. We did not have significant dependencies on any other foreign countries as of December 31, 2020. While the vast majority of our revenues are sourced in the U.S. and all significant corporate assets at December 31, 2020 were located in the U.S., we host data in foreign countries, such as the United Kingdom and Switzerland, and are planning to increase our international footprint in the United Kingdom and European Union for further revenue growth in those geographic areas.   
Financial Information About Industry Segments 
 We have one reportable segment consisting of email encryption and security solutions. We internally evaluate all of our product offerings and other sources of revenue as one industry segment, and, accordingly, do not report segment information.
