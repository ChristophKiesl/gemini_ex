Business Operations and Proposed Merger Transaction

The primary business of the Company is to seek a suitable private company acquisition.  The Company has not been engaged in any other business activity.  

Background of Proposed Merger Transaction

On October 28, 2022, the Company and Renovo, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Original Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which Renovo would be merged with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company being the legal successor or surviving corporation in the Merger. 

On March 31, 2023, the parties entered into First Amendment to the Merger Agreement (“First Amendment”) which amended the Original Merger Agreement to, among other things, extend the date for the closing of the Merger and to revise certain other provisions relating to a delay in the receipt of Renovo’s audited financial statements required as a condition for closing. 

On August 17, 2023 the board of directors of the Company approved and, on August 18, 2023, the Company entered into the Second Amendment with Renovo.  Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Merger Agreement was amended to, among other things: (i) eliminate the condition that Renovo acquire 6 LLC, a Florida limited liability company owned and controlled by the shareholders of Renovo that owns the buildings and property (“Property”) on which Renovo conducts its operations (“6 LLC”) prior to the Merger (“Acquisition Condition”); (ii) require as a condition to the closing of the Merger that Renovo would take all steps necessary to cause: (a) 6 LLC to enter into a new lease agreement (the “Lease”), with an initial term of two years for the Property on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Company with Renovo effective concurrently with or immediately after the closing of the Merger; and (b) 6 LLC and all of the 6 LLC owners to grant the surviving corporation an exclusive option to purchase 6 LLC for a period of years following the closing of the Merger (“Purchase Option”) and to enter into an agreement regarding the Purchase Option with the surviving corporation (the “Purchase Option Agreement”); (iii) require delivery of the executed Purchase Option Agreement and Lease at the closing of the Merger, and (iv) extend the outside termination date for the closing as set forth in the Original Merger Agreement (the “Outside Termination Date”) to October 31, 2023. 

On December 15, 2023, the Company and Renovo entered into a letter agreement (“Letter Agreement”), whereby they again agreed to extend the Outside Terminate Date to March 31, 2024 and to reduce the number of directors that will be appointed to the Company’s board of directors by Renovo following the Merger.  With respect to the composition of the board of directors following the Merger, Kristen N. Toomey, one of the prospective Renovo appointees, has subsequently informed the parties that she will not serve on the board of directors following the Merger.  Accordingly, pursuant to the Letter Agreement, the parties have determined to revise the terms of the Merger Agreement to only expand the Board to six directors and appoint the remaining previously disclosed Renovo appointees to the board of directors following the consummation of the Merger.

The foregoing description of the Letter Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Letter Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.4 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated into this Form 10-K by reference.

The Original Merger Agreement, the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, and the Letter Agreement are referred to collectively herein as the “Merger Agreement”.

Summary of Proposed Terms of the Proposed Merger

Set forth below is a summary of some of the significant terms of the Merger transaction. 

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding common share, no par value, of Renovo (“Renovo Stock”) will be converted into and will represent the right to receive 6,000 shares (“Exchange Ratio”) of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (“Company Stock”), after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split (described below). The Exchange Ratio shall be fixed and no adjustment shall be made under any circumstances other than with respect to certain anti-dilution provision of the Merger Agreement. No fractional share of the Company Stock will be issued pursuant to the Merger. To the extent that a holder of Renovo Stock would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Company Stock (after taking into account all certificates delivered by such holder), such holder shall receive, in lieu thereof, an additional fraction of a share of the Company Stock rounded up to the nearest whole share of the Company Stock.

The Merger Agreement requires the parties to enter into various ancillary agreements related to the Merger, including an Investment Letter with each of the shareholders of Renovo (the “Renovo Owners”), which contains various representations and warranties relating to the Renovo Owners’ investor status and an agreement regarding transfer restrictions related to the Common Stock to be issued to the Renovo Owners in exchange for the Renovo Stock and a related registration rights agreement pursuant to which the Renovo Owners may request, under certain circumstances and conditions, that the Company register the shares received by the Renovo Owners in connection with the Merger under the Securities Act (the “Registration Rights Agreement”).  As described above, pursuant to the Second Amendment, the parties are also required to deliver the Purchase Option Agreement and the Lease. 

The foregoing description of the Registration Rights Agreement and the Investment Letter does not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the complete text thereof, complete copies of which have been filed as exhibits to the Original Merger Agreement filed as Exhibit 2.1 to the Original Merger Form 8-K, and are hereby incorporated by reference herein. Similarly, the foregoing description of the Lease and the Purchase Option Agreement does not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the complete text thereof, complete copies of which have been filed as exhibits to the Second Amendment, which Second Amendment was included as an exhibit 2.1 to the Second Amendment Form 8-K filed with the Commission, and is incorporated herein by reference.

Consummation of the Merger is subject to a number of conditions, including among others, the following: (i) approval of the Merger Agreement by Renovo’s stockholders (“Renovo Stockholder Approval”), (ii) the Company, as the surviving corporation in the Merger, shall have been approved as a Secondary Metals Recycler under Section 538.25 of the Florida Statutes to be effective immediately following the closing of the Merger, (iii) Renovo shall have provided the Company with a loan of approximately $200,000 (“Renovo Loan”), as evidenced by a promissory note, to provide the funds necessary for the Company to continue operations and consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (“Renovo Promissory Note”), (iv) the Company shall have entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit A to the Merger Agreement, with each of the Renovo shareholders, (v) each of the Renovo shareholders shall have entered into an Investment Letter which is attached as Exhibit B to the Merger Agreement, (vi) the execution and delivery of the Lease by and between Renovo and 6 LLC,  a copy of each which is attached as Exhibit A to the Second Agreement, (vii) the execution and delivery the Purchase Option Agreement by and between the Company and 6 LLC, a copy of each which is attached as Exhibit B to the Second Agreement, (viii) there shall not have been any material adverse effects on the operations of Renovo, (ix) there shall not have been certain additional adverse legal proceedings commenced against the Company or Renovo which prevents the consummation of the Merger transactions, and (x) the satisfaction of certain other customary closing conditions. The Renovo Stockholder Approval and the Renovo Loan conditions have been satisfied as of the date hereof. In addition to the conditions described above, the closing of the Merger transaction also is conditioned upon the approval and prior implementation of an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company to effect (a) a 1-for 500 reverse stock split, such that every holder of the Company’s Common Stock shall receive one share of the Company’s Common Stock for every 500 shares of the Company’s Common Stock held prior to such reverse stock split, and all fractional shares resulting therefrom will be rounded up to the nearest whole share; and (b) a corresponding reduction of the number of authorized shares of Company’s Common Stock from 200,000,000 to 20,000,000 shares and the number of shares of Company’s Preferred Stock from 20,000,000 to 2,000,000 shares (collectively, the “Reverse Stock Split”).

The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants made by Renovo, including, among other things, covenants (i) to conduct its business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice during the interim period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and consummation of the Merger and (ii) not to engage in certain kinds of transactions during such period. The Merger Agreement also contains certain termination rights for both the Company and Renovo.  

The Merger Agreement may be terminated at any time before the effective time of the Merger, whether before or after receipt of the Company’s stockholder approval of the Merger, under the following circumstances: (a) by mutual written consent of both parties; (b) by either party if the Merger is not consummated by the Outside Termination Date (as revised under the Letter Agreement, March 31, 2024), provided, however, that no such termination may be made if the failure to close by such date is caused by the action or inaction of the party seeking to terminate the Merger Agreement and such action or inaction is a material breach by such party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement; (c) by either party in the event any material governmental approval required for consummation of the Merger shall have been denied by a final non-appealable action of the applicable governmental authority or if such action taken is not appealed within the time limit for appeal; (d) by either party in the event that any of the conditions precedent to the obligations of such party to consummate the Merger cannot be satisfied or fulfilled by the Outside Termination Date (provided that the terminating party is not then in breach of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement under the applicable standard set forth in the Merger Agreement or is in material breach of any covenant or other agreement contained in the Merger Agreement); or (e) by the Company if (i) the board of directors of Renovo has withdrawn, modified, or changed its recommendation that the Renovo Owners approve the Merger Agreement, (ii) Renovo has breached its non-solicitation obligations, or (iii) Renovo has failed to execute the Renovo Loan agreements within four business days after the execution of the Merger Agreement (which Renovo Loan was timely executed and funded).

Under certain circumstances, if the Company terminates the Merger Agreement for the reason set forth above (other than by mutual agreement or passage of the Outside Termination Date), or Renovo terminates the Merger Agreement in connection with another acquisition proposal, the Company may be entitled to a termination fee of up to $350,000 (for breaches of the non-solicitation and Renovo recommendation requirements or Renovo’s termination relating to an acquisition proposal) and/or the Company expenses associated with the Merger Agreement and the steps taken in connection with the anticipated consummation of the Merger (including those incurred in connection with the preparation of anticipated Commission filings and the preparation of an Information Statement to be disseminated to stockholders in connection with any stockholders’ meeting seeking approval of the Merger).

If the Merger is consummated, the Company has agreed to take all actions reasonably necessary at the effective time of the Merger to expand the size of the Board of Directors to six and to appoint the following shareholders of Renovo to the surviving corporation’s Board of Directors to fill the vacancies created thereby: Randall A. Moritz, Keri A. Moritz, and Lori M. Toomey. Lori M. Toomey and James K. Toomey are spouses. 

Under the rules and regulations of the Commission, the Company, as a shell company, is required to file a Form 8-K within four business days following the close of such Merger transaction that includes certain information relating to the post-Merger surviving corporation as would be required in a Form 10 filed under the Exchange Act, including without limitation, all required disclosures concerning the post-Merger operations and management of the Company and all required consolidated and pro forma financial statements (“Merger Form 8-K”). The ability to prepare the Merger Form 8-K will be largely dependent on the ability of Renovo to furnish the Company with audited financial statements and other information necessary to prepare such Merger Form 8-K. As a result, as a condition to the closing of the Merger, Renovo is required to provide the Company with all information concerning Renovo and the Renovo Owners as the Company may reasonably request in connection with preparing such Form 8-K disclosures. If Renovo is unable to timely furnish such information to the Company, of which there is no assurance, the Merger Agreement may be terminated and the Merger transaction will not be consummated.

Although the parties have executed the Merger Agreement, there is no assurance that the parties will be able to consummate a Merger transaction. There can be no assurance that the conditions required to complete the Merger will be satisfied or waived on the anticipated schedule, or at all. 

The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to (a) the Original Merger Agreement, a complete and true copy of which has been filed as Exhibit 1.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) on October 31, 2022 (“Original Merger Form 8-K”), and is incorporated herein by reference, (b) the First Amendment, a complete and true copy of which has been filed as Exhibit to 2.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission on April 3, 2023 (“First Amendment Form 8-K”), and is incorporated herein by reference, and (c) the Second Amendment, a complete and true copy of which has been filed as Exhibit to 2.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission on August 21, 2023 (“Second Amendment Form 8-K”), and is incorporated herein by reference.

Blank Check and Shell Company Status

To the extent that the Company should engage in the public issuance of its stock, the Company may be considered to be a “blank check” company and be subject to certain restrictions and regulations related to the use of aggregate proceeds therefrom.  The rules and regulations of the Commission defines blank check companies as “any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3(a)(51) of the Exchange Act and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies.”  Pursuant to Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, the Company also qualifies as a “shell company,” because it has no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations.  Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of “blank check” companies in their respective jurisdictions.  Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination transaction.  

If the Merger transaction is consummated, the Company should no longer be classified as a shell company under the Commission’s rules and the filing of the Merger Form 8-K should constitute the filing of current “Form 10 Information” under Rule 144(i)(2) and (3) and Instruction B.6. of Form S-3, each as promulgated by the Commission under the Securities Act. 

Employees 

We presently have no employees apart from our management.  Our officers and directors are engaged in outside business activities and are employed on a full-time basis by certain unaffiliated companies. Our officers and directors will be dividing their time among these entities and anticipates that they will devote very limited time to our business until the acquisition of a successful business opportunity has been identified. The specific amount of time that management will devote to the Company may vary from week to week or even day to day, and therefore the specific amount of time that management will devote to the Company on a weekly basis cannot be ascertained with any level of certainty. In all cases, management intends to spend as much time as is necessary to exercise its fiduciary duties as an officer and director of the Company and believes that it will be able to devote the time required to consummate a business combination transaction as necessary.  We expect no significant changes in the number of our employees or the amount of time devoted to our business by our officers and directors other than such changes, if any, incident to any business combination, including the Merger, if consummated.
