Strategy
Businesses all around the world are experiencing significant growth in demand for networking services as they work to keep pace with increasing bandwidth demands across all applications, migrate applications to the cloud, virtualize key applications, and outsource IT infrastructure services.  We believe our global network reach and focused portfolio of cloud networking service offerings uniquely positions GTT to address these trends and to serve the complex, ever-changing needs of large national and multinational clients.
Our strategy is focused on three key elements:
Expanding cloud networking services to large and multinational clients. Our network assets and services are built to serve the requirements of large, global clients. These organizations have increasing demands for scalable, secure, and flexible network connectivity due to the rapid adoption of cloud-based applications and increasing data usage across locations driven by increasing file sizes, voice, video, and real-time collaboration tools. In addition, enterprise CIOs and technology executives are increasingly using third-party management of their network and IT infrastructure so their teams can focus on application development and performance. We are one of the few non-legacy telco monopolist providers with the product breadth, global scope, and operating experience to meet the sophisticated networking needs and managed service requirements of the world’s most demanding multinational clients, and we will continue to look for ways to enhance our portfolio of services to meet our clients’ needs.
Extending secure network connectivity to any location in the world and any application in the cloud. We operate one of the largest internet networks in the world, and our global access footprint is one of the broadest in the industry. Network connectivity is a fundamental requirement for clients to realize the full benefits of cloud computing, and they are increasingly demanding dedicated, secure, and high-bandwidth connectivity between their various office locations and leading cloud service providers for mission-critical applications and services. We can connect any client location in the world to our global network through our core network infrastructure and relationships with over 3,000 regional suppliers. We will continue to seek opportunities to expand our global footprint to enable our clients to connect to the cloud more efficiently and cost-effectively.
Delivering outstanding client experience by living our core values of Simplicity, Speed and Agility. We strive to be easy to work with, fast and responsive, and to say "yes" to our clients. We are committed to delivering high-quality, reliable, and secure services that will continue to attract new clients and create additional opportunities with existing clients. We believe that by operating all 
1

areas of our business with simplicity, speed and agility, we offer clients a better service experience than larger legacy monopolist providers.
We execute on this strategy both through rep-driven growth and through strategic acquisitions. As of December 31, 2019, we have 436 quota bearing reps focused on designing and delivering world-class global network solutions that connect diversely and securely to any office location in the world and to any application in the cloud. We continue to expand our sales force through external hiring, internal development, and through acquisitions. We have completed many acquisitions throughout our history, and we believe we have consistently demonstrated an ability to acquire and effectively integrate companies and realize cost synergies. Acquisitions have the ability to increase the scale of our operations and expand our market presence, which in turn affords us the ability to extend our network reach, augment our product set, and broaden our client base.  We also evaluate opportunities to divest of non-strategic, non-core assets and businesses to enable us to deepen our strategic focus on expanding cloud networking services.
Global Network
Our global network spans North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Australia. Our Tier 1 IP network consists of over 600 unique PoPs in top data centers and carrier exchanges around the world, directly connects to many of the leading cloud service providers and is underpinned by a resilient and redundant transport architecture. Based on industry data, our IP backbone is consistently ranked as a top network in terms of internet routes. We own and operate three trans-Atlantic subsea cables connecting North America and Europe, including our industry leading lowest latency Express subsea cable system, as well as more than 105,000 route kilometers of terrestrial fiber and subsea network facilities, including an expansive pan-European transport network. 
We engineer our network to provide high levels of capacity and performance, even when utilizing enhanced services such as traffic analysis and filtering. We route network traffic to ensure client applications take the shortest path possible through the network, delivering low latency performance, reliability, and security. 
We employ a "capex light" model, which leverages the sophisticated routing and switching infrastructure in our core global network, then integrates network access leased from last mile carriers. This business model benefits us and our clients. We are able to quickly add capacity as needed, minimize infrastructure deployment, maintenance and replacement costs, and focus solely on designing the best network solutions for our clients' specific needs.

Operations
Supplier Management
We have strong, long-standing relationships with a diverse group of over 3,000 suppliers from which we source our global network connectivity, last-mile bandwidth capacity, and other services. We maintain multiple supplier agreements covering diverse routes throughout our network to ensure service continuity, competitive pricing, bandwidth capacity, and improved carrier responsiveness.
For our core global network, supplier agreements for lit capacity are typically short-term commitments with an option to renew, which enables us to (i) maintain significant flexibility regarding the amount of bandwidth purchased and (ii) consistently benefit from the latest competitive pricing. For last-mile connections, we typically structure the term to match the term of the underlying client contract.
Our supplier management team continually monitors supplier performance, network information, and pricing to provide greater choice, flexibility, and cost savings for our clients.
Network Operations
Our network is supported by Network Operations Centers ("NOCs") located in the US, Ireland, Bulgaria, and India. The NOCs provide active monitoring, prioritization, and resolution of network-related events 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Our NOCs also respond to client network inquiries, and coordinate and notify clients of maintenance activities.
IT Systems
We maintain several proprietary client facing and internally focused IT systems. We provide clients with advanced routing control and visibility into their network performance. Our proprietary online client portal (EtherVision) provides clients with online access to monitor their network performance and track real-time statistics.
We have developed a comprehensive Client Management Database ("CMD") that manages our network, client and supplier contracts, sales quoting, service provisioning, and client invoicing. CMD also supports our financial reporting and other operational processes as well as our integration of acquired companies. Our CMD system has been in operation since our inception, and its capabilities and processes are continually enhanced and automated. The CMD system provides our management team with visibility into all areas of our operations and allows us to operate with simplicity, speed and agility.
Sales and Marketing
We market our products and services through a global direct sales force and indirect sales channels. We have sales representatives throughout North America, Europe, South America, the Middle East, and Asia. Our sales activities are specifically focused on building relationships with new clients and driving expansion within existing client accounts. Because we typically sell to large, global clients and our markets are highly competitive, we believe that personal relationships and quality of service delivery remain important in winning new and repeat client business. Over the last 12 months, we have bolstered our direct salesforce with an expanded indirect sales organization as well as the hiring of sales development representatives who set appointments with new client prospects for our account directors. 
We supplement our direct sales approach with a trusted community of agents and system integrators who already have personal relationships with many leading multinational clients. 
GTT's marketing activities aim to generate broad awareness and promote our value proposition to multinational clients, applying both traditional and digital marketing methods that target key client decision makers.
Clients
Our client base consists of enterprise, carrier, and government clients around the world. Our multinational enterprise client base includes leading organizations in financial services, healthcare, technology, manufacturing, retail, media and entertainment, and professional services. Carrier clients include some of the largest telecommunications in the world, who rely on our global network to meet their large capacity requirements and extend their reach.
Our client contracts are most commonly two to three years for the initial term but can range from one to five years or sometimes longer. Following the initial term, these agreements typically provide for automatic renewal for specified periods ranging from one month to one year. Our prices are fixed for the duration of the contract, and we typically bill monthly in advance for such services. If a client terminates its agreement, the terms of our client contracts typically require full recovery of any amounts due for the remainder of the term or, at a minimum, our liability to any underlying suppliers.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive industry. Our competitors include the legacy telecom monopolist carriers, competitive telecom carriers, internet service providers, cable companies, and other facilities-based operators. Many of these competitors are large, well-capitalized, and have strong market presence, brand recognition, and existing client relationships. We also face competition from smaller providers who offer network services and managed enterprise solutions similar to ours. Specific competitors vary based on geography, product offering, and vertical market.
Regulatory Matters
We are subject to US federal and state, and foreign regulations. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") has jurisdiction over interstate telecommunications and international telecommunications that originate or terminate in the United States. State Public Utilities Commissions ("PUCs") have similar powers with respect to intrastate telecommunications. Foreign country laws and regulations typically apply to telecommunications that originate or terminate in, or in some instances traverse, that country. The regulation of the telecommunications industry is constantly evolving, and varies from state to state and from country to country.
Where certification, licensing, or authorization is required, carriers are required to comply with certain ongoing responsibilities. For example, we are required to submit periodic reports to various telecommunications regulatory authorities relating to the provision 
of services within relevant jurisdictions. In addition, we are responsible for the payment of certain regulatory fees and the collection and remittance of certain surcharges and fees associated with the provision of telecommunications services depending upon the jurisdiction, the type of service, and the type of client.
Intellectual Property
We do not own any material patent registrations, applications, or licenses.
