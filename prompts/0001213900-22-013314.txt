ITEM 1. BUSINESS



In this Amendment, references to the “Company” and to “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Alberton Acquisition Corporation.



General



We, Alberton Acquisition Corporation (“Alberton”), were incorporated on February 16, 2018 as a British Virgin Islands company for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more target businesses. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business are not limited to any particular industry or geographic location. We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of our initial public offering, our securities, debt or a combination of cash, securities and debt, in effecting our initial business combination.



On October 26, 2018, we consummated our initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 10,000,000 units. Each unit consists of one ordinary share (the “Ordinary Shares”), one redeemable warrant to purchase one-half of one Ordinary Share, and one right to receive 1/10 of an Ordinary Share upon the consummation of an initial business combination. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $100,000,000. We granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 1,500,000 additional units to cover over-allotments. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we consummated a private placement with Hong Ye Hong Kong Shareholding Co., Limited (“Hong Ye” or the “Sponsor”), of 300,000 private units at a price of $10.00 per private unit, generating gross proceeds of $3,000,000. On October 26, 2018, a total of $100,000,000 of the net proceeds from the sale of the units in the IPO and the sale of the private units in the private placement were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of our public shareholders (the “Trust Account”).



On November 20, 2018, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in part and purchased an additional 1,487,992 units, which were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $14,879,920. Simultaneously with the sale of the over-allotment units, we consummated another private placement with the Sponsor of 29,760 private units at a price of $10.00 per private unit, generating total additional gross proceeds of $297,600. On November 20, 2018, the underwriters waived its right to exercise the reminder of the over-allotment option. As of November 20, 2018, an additional $14,879,920 of the net proceeds from the sale of the over-allotment units and the additional units in the private placement were placed in the Trust Account established for the benefit of our public shareholders, bringing the aggregate amount placed in the Trust Account to be $114,879,920.

In connection with the Extension Amendment, public shareholders of 50 Alberton ordinary shares redeemed their shares for a pro rata portion of the Trust Account.



On October 28, 2021, Alberton received a notice from the staff of the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq indicating that, unless Alberton timely requests a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”), Alberton’s securities (ordinary shares, warrants, units and rights) would be subject to suspension and delisting from Nasdaq due to the Alberton’s non-compliance with Nasdaq IM-5101-2, which requires that a special purpose acquisition company must complete one or more business combinations within 36 months of the effectiveness of its IPO registration statement. Following the submission of a hearing request by Alberton, a hearing was held on December 16, 2021. On January 3, 2022, Alberton received a notice from Nasdaq Office of General Counsel that the Panel had granted the Company’s request to continue its listing on Nasdaq through March 14, 2022 (the “Original Granted Extension Date”).



On February 28, 2022, Alberton submitted a request for additional extension from the Original Granted Extension Date to April 26, 2022, the Outside Date, because it needed additional time to prepare and include the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 of each of Alberton and SolarMax in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, which request was granted by the Panel on March 3, 2022. The Panel’s decision is subject to certain conditions, including that the Company will have completed the Merger SolarMax on or before the Outside Date and will have demonstrated compliance with all applicable requirements for initial listing on Nasdaq. The Panel stated that April 26, 2022 represents the full extent of the Panel’s discretion to grant continued listing while the Company is non-compliant. 



From November 1, 2020 through the date hereof, Alberton and SolarMax and their representatives continued to correspond regarding updates to the Alberton preliminary proxy statement/prospectus.

Historical Extensions



On April 23, 2020, Alberton held a special meeting, at which its shareholders approved (i) an amendment to Alberton’s then current memorandum and articles of association, extending the date by which Alberton must consummate its initial business combination from April 27, 2020 to October 26, 2020 or such earlier date as determined by the Alberton Board (the “April 2020 Extension”). In connection with the April 2020 Extension, public stockholders owning 10,073,512 ordinary shares of Alberton exercised their right to have their public shares redeemed, and those shareholders received $105,879,118 (or $10.51 per share) from the trust fund. In connection with the April 2020 Extension, Alberton deposited into the trust account six monthly cash contribution of $60,000 per month in the aggregate amount of $360,000 and issued public shareholders who remained with us after April 2020 Extension one public warrants per public share.



On October 26, 2020, Alberton held another special meeting, at which its shareholders approved an amendment to Alberton’s then current memorandum and articles of association, extending the date by which Alberton must consummate its initial business combination from October 26, 2020 to April 26, 2021 or such earlier date as determined by the Alberton Board (the “October 2020 Extension”). In connection with the October 2020 Extension, the holders of an additional 1,000 ordinary shares exercised their right to have their public shares redeemed, and those shareholders received $10,770.13 (or $10.77 per share) from the trust account. In connection with October 2020 Extension, Alberton deposited, for each remaining public share that did not redeem, for each monthly period, or portion thereof during the October 2020 Extension, $0.05 per share per month, of $70,674, into the trust account as additional interest on the proceeds in the trust account.



On April 23, 2021, Alberton held another special meeting, at which its shareholders approved an amendment to Alberton’s then current memorandum and articles of association, extending the date by which Alberton must consummate its initial business combination from April 26, 2021 to October 26, 2021 or such earlier date as determined by the Board (the “April 2021 Extension”). In connection with the approval of the April 2021 Extension, shareholders elected to redeem an aggregate of 135,069 of our ordinary shares. As a result, an aggregate of $1,495,303.45 (or $11.07 per share) was released from our Trust Account to pay such shareholders. In connection with this vote, Alberton made monthly payments of $76,704.66 which payment were funded by extension loans from SolarMax.



On October 22, 2021, Alberton held a special meeting of shareholders, pursuant to which its shareholders approved the Extension Amendment to extend the last date by which Alberton must complete a business combination from October 26, 2021 to April 26, 2022 (the “October 2021 Extension”). In connection with the October 2021 Extension, the holders of 50 Alberton ordinary shares redeemed their shares; and Alberton has agreed to make a monthly extension payment of $127,836.10.



As the date hereof, in connection with the April 2020 Extension, the October 2020 Extension, the April 2021 Extension and the October 2021 Extension, Alberton paid $105,879,118, $10,770, $1,495,303 and $572, respectively, or a total of $107,385,763, to public shareholders who exercised their redemption rights; and made relevant cash contribution to the Trust Account. As a result, we currently have approximately $14.9 million in the Trust Account. and will be distributed pro rata as a part of redemption amount to each public share in connection with a future redemption.



Outstanding Promissory Notes




The GN Notes



As the date hereof, we have outstanding loans from various parties in the aggregated amount of $4,493,247 which include (i) unsecured promissory notes in the amount of $300,000 and $780,000 issued by Alberton to its Sponsors on July 6, 2018 and January 24, 2020, respectively (collectively, the “Sponsor Notes”), (ii) unsecured promissory notes in the amount of $1,148,800 and $500,000 issued by Alberton to Global Nature Investment Holdings Limited on September 18, 2019 and December 3, 2019, respectively (collectively, the “GN Notes”); (iii) an unsecured promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of $500,000 payable upon demands, the outstanding principal of which is $100,000 issued by Alberton to Qingdao Zhongxin Huirong Distressed Asset Disposal Co., Ltd on April 17, 2020 (the “AMC Note”), (iv) unsecured promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1,387,780 issued by Alberton to SolarMax in connection with the extension of the date that Alberton must complete its initial business combination, each in the amount of $60,000 on September 4, 2020 and October 8, 2020, each in the amount of $70,674 on November 10, 2020, December 9, 2020, January 11, 2021, February 11, 2021, March 19, 2021, and April 26, 2021, in the amount of $153,409 on June 21, 2021, in the amount of $230,114 on September 28, 2021, in the amount of $76,705 on October 13, 2021, each in the amount of $127,836 on November 4, 2021, December 8, 2021 and January 18, 2022 (collectively, the “SolarMax Extension Notes”) and (v) unsecured promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $276,666 issued by Alberton to SolarMax to provide Alberton with funds to pay for Alberton’s operating costs (the “SolarMax Promissory Notes”).

Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic



In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, which has and is continuing to spread throughout China and other parts of the world, including the United States. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern.” On January 31, 2020, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency for the United States to aid the U.S. healthcare community in responding to COVID-19, and on March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak as a “pandemic”. A significant outbreak of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets worldwide. In response to COVID-19, governmental authorities have recommended or ordered to limit or cease certain business or commercial activities and the issuance of the certain permits necessary for solar installation are restricted due to the closure of reduced office hours of the government offices in California and China. SolarMax’ operations could be materially and adversely affected and the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may materially impact SolarMax’ financial condition, liquidity or results of operations is uncertain. Furthermore, we may be unable to complete a business combination if continued concerns relating to COVID-19 restrict travel, limit the ability to have meetings with potential investors or the target company’s personnel, vendors and services providers are unavailable to negotiate and consummate a transaction in a timely manner. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our search for a business combination will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. If the disruptions posed by COVID-19 or other matters of global concern continue for an extensive period of time, our ability to consummate a business combination, or the operations of a target business.
EFFECTING A BUSINESS COMBINATION



General



We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of the IPO and the private placement of private units, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these in effecting a business combination. A business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding what it may deem to be adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself. These include time delays, significant expense and potential loss of voting control, among others. In the alternative, we may seek to consummate a business combination with a company that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth. While we may seek to effect simultaneous business combinations with more than one target business, we will probably have the ability, as a result of our limited resources, to effect only a single business combination.



Subject to the requirement that while we are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market our target business have a fair market value of 80% of the Trust Account balance (excluding the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account), as described below, we will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective acquisition candidate. Except as described below, we have not established any other specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses. To the extent we effect a business combination with a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stage of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.



Business Combination Procedures



In connection with the proposed Business Combination with SolarMax, we will seek shareholder approval of such initial business combination at a special meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to redeem their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination. A shareholder of public shares may redeem the public shares for cash equal to a pro rata share of the aggregate amount on deposit in the Trust Account which holds the proceeds of our IPO as of two (2) business days prior to the Closing, less taxes payable, upon the Closing. Our Sponsor and Initial Shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any shares of our capital stock they may hold in connection with the Closing, and the founder shares will be excluded from the pro rata calculation used to determine the per-share redemption price.





10







Our capability to consummate the business combination, and any target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected by the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.



In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, which has and is continuing to spread throughout China and other parts of the world, including the United States. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern.” On January 31, 2020, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency for the United States to aid the U.S. healthcare community in responding to COVID-19, and on March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak as a “pandemic”. A significant outbreak of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets worldwide. In response to COVID-19, governmental authorities have recommended or ordered to limit or cease certain business or commercial activities and the issuance of the certain permits necessary for solar installation are restricted due to the closure of reduced office hours of the government offices in California and China. SolarMax’ operations could be materially and adversely affected and the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may materially impact SolarMax’ financial condition, liquidity or results of operations is uncertain. Furthermore, we may be unable to complete a business combination if continued concerns relating to COVID-19 restrict travel, limit the ability to have meetings with potential investors or the target company’s personnel, vendors and services providers are unavailable to negotiate and consummate a transaction in a timely manner. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our search for a business combination will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. If the disruptions posed by COVID-19 or other matters of global concern continue for an extensive period of time, our ability to consummate a business combination, or the operations of a target business.



Submission of Our Initial Business Combination to a Shareholder Vote



In connection with IPO, each of the Initial Shareholders entered into a letter agreement with Alberton pursuant to which the Initial Shareholders agreed to vote any Alberton ordinary shares owned by them in favor of the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement, by and among Alberton, Merger Sub, and SolarMax, and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the issuance of the merger consideration thereunder (the “Alberton Business Combination Proposal”). Collectively, Alberton Initial Shareholders own 71.5% of the voting rights of Alberton immediately prior to the Business Combination. In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Sponsor and an insider shareholder, representing 56.71% of the voting rights of Alberton as of the record date entered into a sponsor voting agreement (the “Sponsor Voting Agreements”) with Alberton and SolarMax pursuant to which, they agree to vote all of their shares of Alberton ordinary shares in favor of the Merger Agreement and related transactions and to otherwise take certain other actions in support of the Merger Agreement and related transactions and refrain from taking actions that would adversely affect such sponsor’s ability to perform its obligations under the Sponsor Voting Agreement, and provide a proxy to Alberton to vote such Alberton ordinary shares accordingly.



Public shareholders will be able to redeem their public shares in connection with the expected shareholder vote to approve the proposed business combination with SolarMax, which shall be consummated by April 26, 2022 or such earlier date as determined by the board of directors of Alberton, provided, however, that in the event that the redemptions result in Alberton having less than $5,000,001 in net tangible assets as of the Closing, or the Successor not satisfying the applicable listing requirements of Nasdaq, which include a $4.0 million stockholder’s equity if the market value of the listed securities is at least $50.0 million and $5.0 million if that test is not met, and a $15.0 million market value of unrestricted publicly held shares after giving effect to the consummation of the Merger and any private financing, then either party may terminate the Merger Agreement, and the Business Combination will not be consummated as a result of such termination.



Our Initial Shareholders, officers, and directors have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to the founder shares, private shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with the Closing. The founder shares and private shares will be excluded from the pro rata calculation used to determine the per-share redemption price.





11







Holders of outstanding units must separate the underlying public shares and public warrants prior to exercising redemption rights with respect to the public shares.



We may require public shareholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either (i) tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent or (ii) deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, in each case prior to a date set forth in the proxy materials sent in connection with the proposal to approve the business combination.



There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced delivery process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights to deliver their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require shareholders seeking to exercise conversion rights prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated this may result in an increased cost to shareholders.



Any proxy solicitation materials we furnish to shareholders in connection with a vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring shareholders to satisfy such certification and delivery requirements. Accordingly, a shareholder would have from the time the shareholder received our proxy statement up until the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination to deliver his shares if such shareholder wishes to seek to exercise his conversion rights. This time period varies depending on the specific facts of each transaction. However, as the delivery process can be accomplished by the shareholder, whether or not he is a record holder or his shares are held in “street name,” in a matter of hours by simply contacting the transfer agent or his broker and requesting delivery of his shares through the DWAC System, we believe this time period is sufficient for an average investor. However, we cannot assure you of this fact.



Any request to convert such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination or the expiration of the tender offer. Furthermore, if a holder of public shares delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their conversion and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).



If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their conversion rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.



Liquidation if No Business Combination



Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provided that we will have until April 26, 2022 to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination by April 26, 2022 or such longer period that our shareholders may approve, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the Trust Account not previously released to us for our tax obligations, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, seek to dissolve and liquidate subject to our obligations under British Virgin Islands law to provide for claims of creditors in all cases subject to and the other requirements of applicable law. This redemption of public shares from the Trust Account shall be effected as required by function of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and prior to any voluntary winding up, although at all times subject to the Companies Act.





12







Following the redemption of public shares, we intend to enter “voluntary liquidation” which is the statutory process for formally closing and dissolving a company under the laws of the British Virgin Islands. Given that we intend to enter voluntary liquidation following the redemption of public shareholders from the Trust Account, we do not expect that the voluntary liquidation process will cause any delay to the payment of redemption proceeds from our Trust Account. In connection with such a voluntary liquidation, the liquidator would give notice to creditors inviting them to submit their claims for payment, by notifying known creditors (if any) who have not submitted claims and by placing a public advertisement in at least one newspaper published in the British Virgin Islands and in at least one newspaper circulating in the location where we have our principal place of business, and taking any other steps the liquidator considers appropriate to identify our creditors, after which our remaining assets would be distributed. As soon as our affairs are fully wound-up, the liquidator must complete his statement of account and make a notice filing with the registrar. We would be dissolved once the registrar issues a Certificate of Dissolution.



Our initial shareholders, which include our independent directors, have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by April 26, 2022 or not otherwise extend the date that we need to complete our business combination. However, if our initial shareholders or management team acquire public shares in or after the IPO, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by April 26, 2022.



Our executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to written agreements with us, that they will not propose, or vote in favor of, any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, prior to a business combination, that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by April 26, 2022, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to a number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our initial shareholders, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person.



There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants or rights, both of which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination by April 26, 2022. We will pay the costs of our liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the Trust Account. However, the liquidator may determine that he or she requires additional time to evaluate creditors’ claims (particularly if there is uncertainty over the validity or extent of the claims of any creditors). Also, a creditor or shareholder may file a petition with the British Virgin Islands court which, if successful, may result in our liquidation being subject to the supervision of that court. Such events might delay distribution of some or all of our remaining assets.



If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of the IPO and the private placements, other than the proceeds deposited in the Trust Account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the Trust Account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be less than $10.00. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.



Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, Hong Ye, an entity owned by Guan Wang, has contractually agreed pursuant to a written agreement with us that, if we liquidate the Trust Account prior to the consummation of a business combination, it will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in the Trust Account are not reduced by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us. We believe Hong Ye has sufficient financial resources to satisfy its indemnity obligation should it arise, however we cannot assure you it will have sufficient liquid assets to satisfy such obligations if it is required to do so. Additionally, the agreement entered into with Hong Ye specifically provides for two exceptions to the indemnity given: it will have no liability (1) as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has executed an agreement with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the Trust Account, or (2) as to any claims for indemnification by the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. As a result, we cannot assure you that the per-share distribution from the Trust Account, if we liquidate the Trust Account because we have not completed a business combination within the required time period, will not be less than $10.00.





13







In the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case less taxes payable, and Hong Ye asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against Hong Ye to enforce such indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf to enforce these indemnification obligations, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per share.



If we are deemed insolvent for the purposes of the Insolvency Act (i.e., (i) we fail to comply with the requirements of a statutory demand that has not been set aside under Section 157 of the Insolvency Act; (ii) execution or other process issued on a judgment, decree or order of a British Virgin Islands court in favor of a creditor of ours is returned wholly or partly unsatisfied; or (iii) either the value of our liabilities exceeds its assets, or the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due), then there are very limited circumstances where prior payments made to shareholders or other parties may be deemed to be a “voidable transaction” for the purposes of the Insolvency Act. A voidable transaction would include, for these purposes, a payment made as “unfair preferences” or a “transaction at an undervalue”. A liquidator appointed over an insolvent company who considers that a particular transaction or payment is a voidable transaction under the Insolvency Act could apply to a British Virgin Islands courts for an order setting aside that payment or transaction in whole or in part.



Additionally, if we enter insolvent liquidation under the Insolvency Act, the funds held in our Trust Account will likely be included in our estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any insolvency claims deplete the Trust Account we may not be able to return to our public shareholders the liquidation amounts due them. Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period, (ii) in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated Memorandum and Articles of Association prior to the consummation of an initial business combination or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of our initial business combination. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the Trust Account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights and followed the procedures described above and as detailed in the applicable proxy or tender offer materials.



COMPETITION



If we succeed in effecting a business combination with SolarMax, there will be, in all likelihood, significant competition from its competitors. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively. Information regarding SolarMax’ competition is set forth in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, File No. 333-251825, for the meeting to be called to approve the business combination with SolarMax.
FACILITIES



We currently maintain our principal executive offices at Room 1001, 10/F Capital Center, 151 Gloucester Road, Wanchai, Hong Kong. The cost for this space is included in the $1,000 per-month fee that Hong Ye charges us pursuant to a letter agreement between us and Hong Ye for general and administrative services commencing on August 1, 2018 and terminating upon completion of our initial business combination or the distribution of the Trust Account to our public shareholders. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services, that the fee charged by Hong Ye is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. We consider our current office space, combined with the other office space otherwise available to our executive officers, adequate for our current operations.
EMPLOYEES



We currently have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period varies based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, when a suitable target business to acquire is located, management will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time on our affairs) than had been spent prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business. We do not intend to have any other employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.
