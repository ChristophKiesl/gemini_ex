Management's Plan of Operation
 
gocart.city Applications
 
The gocart.city grocery delivery application was released in early June 2020. The gocart.city grocery set of applications has been rolled out on-line and to both the Apple and Google Play stores. To meet the growing demand for grocery delivery on October 20, 2020 we expanded our Greater Toronto delivery area to now include more of southwestern Ontario.
 
We plan to capitalize on the growing online grocery delivery business which we believe the lack of capacity has been recently highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our core offerings include fresh-cut individually packaged fruits and vegetables, specialized foods including Italian themed, artisan, gluten-free and health conscience items. Italian themed products include oils, pasta, deserts, tea, coffee and wine. We also offer utensils to cook a proper Italian meal and accessories for an impressive presentation such as tableware, plates, table cloth, candles, aprons, hats and t-shirts.
 
The gocart.city grocery delivery application only lists items that are in stock so we can guarantee next day delivery.
 
Over the next several months we plan on utilizing and leveraging our agreement with SRAX, Inc. to market our grocery delivery application and services and expand our footprint in the Ontario region and beyond as our customer base grows.
 
It is our ultimate goal to improve the lives of families through the use of our applications, gocart.city, the Two Hands co-parenting solution or Two Hands Gone, our encrypted messaging app.
