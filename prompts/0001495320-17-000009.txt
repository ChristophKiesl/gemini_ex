Our Company
Vera Bradley is a leading designer of women’s handbags, luggage and travel items, fashion and home accessories, and unique gifts. Founded in 1982 by friends Barbara Bradley Baekgaard and Patricia R. Miller, the brand’s innovative designs, iconic patterns, and brilliant colors continue to inspire and connect women. 
Vera Bradley offers a unique, multi-channel sales model, as well as a focus on service and a high level of customer engagement. The Company sells its products through two reportable segments: Direct and Indirect. The Direct business consists of sales of Vera Bradley products through the Company’s full-line and factory outlet stores in the United States, verabradley.com, direct-to-consumer eBay sales, and the Company’s annual outlet sale in Fort Wayne, Indiana. As of January 28, 2017, the Company operated 113 full-line stores and 46 factory outlet stores. The Indirect business consists of sales of Vera Bradley products to approximately 2,600 specialty retail locations, substantially all of which are located in the United States, as well as department stores, national accounts, third party e-commerce sites, the Company's wholesale customer in Japan, and third-party inventory liquidators. For financial information about our reportable segments, refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this report.
Our History
Barbara Bradley Baekgaard and Patricia Miller founded the Company in 1982 in Fort Wayne, Indiana, after recognizing a lack of stylish travel accessories in the market. Within weeks, the friends created Vera Bradley, named after Ms. Bradley Baekgaard’s mother, and began manufacturing and marketing their distinctive products. The founders, together with past and present members of the executive management team, have been instrumental in our growth and success.

Ms. Miller retired in October 2012 as our National Spokesperson, but continues to serve on the Board of Directors along with Ms. Baekgaard.
Growth Strategies
Our long-term vision is to build on the Company's rich heritage and establish Vera Bradley as a premium global lifestyle brand, expand our customer reach and grow our customer connections. Our long-term strategic plan is centered upon the three planks of product, distribution, and marketing.
We call our target aspirational customer the Day Maker. She is organized, thoughtful and, most of all, appreciates femininity and beauty - in color, print and thoughtful details. We are focused on creating “beautiful solutions” for the Day Maker and believe we have a great opportunity to attract more Day Makers to our brand through our product offerings, our distribution channels, and our marketing efforts.
Product.  We have identified five key businesses where we can offer the Day Maker beautiful solutions that we believe will propel our future growth. We are optimizing our existing core product portfolio and expanding into relevant new categories. We will continue to use licenses and strategic partnerships as appropriate to expand our product categories.

• | Our Fashion Bag and Accessories business continues to be our largest opportunity and allows us to showcase our innovation, function, and fashion.


• | Travel remains a core differentiator for Vera Bradley and allows us to both embrace our heritage and to showcase newness and functionality with products like Lighten Up and our unique collapsible luggage.


• | Our Campus business has been successful, and we believe further expansion of our Collegiate Collection will help continue to propel our Campus authority forward.


• | Wellness and Beauty is a growing category as our Day Maker is looking for experiential events and wants to find wellness and beauty products that enhance her holistically. Our home and body fragrance collection and our current line of multi-purpose sport bags play into this theme.

5


• | We believe Home can continue to be a significant growth opportunity for Vera Bradley, with market attractiveness and a great brand fit. The Day Maker’s fashion statement is often her home. Licensing will play a key role in the home area.

In each of these areas, fabric, pattern innovation, and newness remain critical in order to stay relevant. 
Distribution Channels. Vera Bradley products are available wherever our consumer chooses to shop including full-line and factory outlet stores, online, and department and specialty retail stores. We continue to focus on tightly integrating our multi-channel business by strengthening our Direct distribution channel (including full-line stores, factory outlet stores, and e-commerce), further developing our department store and other Indirect channel relationships and right-sizing and working to strengthen the performance in our specialty retail channel.
In 2007 and 2009, we opened our first full-line and factory outlet stores, respectively. We believe there continue to be long-term opportunities for new stores throughout the United States. We opened four new full-line and six new factory outlet stores in fiscal 2017; however, we are continuing to slow our short-term plans for new store openings until we begin to produce comparable store sales growth. 
We do not currently plan to open any new full-line stores in fiscal 2018. In fact, we expect to relocate or close up to 15 underperforming full-line stores over the next two years. In our full-line stores, we are continuing to work to drive traffic and sales through building a service and selling culture, nurturing more community outreach, and building more localized assortments. During fiscal 2017, we refreshed 14 full-line stores to reflect our new branding including updates to the storefront facade, logo, and interior. We also completed facade updates at 15 of our newest full-line stores to reflect our new logo. We are continuing our refresh program and expect that about half of our full-line stores will be updated by the end of fiscal 2018.
We plan to add six new factory outlet stores in fiscal 2018. At January 28, 2017, approximately 70% of the product in the outlet channel was made specifically for our factory outlet stores.
In 2006, we began selling directly to consumers through verabradley.com. In fiscal 2017, we had approximately 53 million visits to our website. Building our digital flagship remains a key part of our distribution strategy. The redesign and conversion of our website to a new platform was completed in February 2017. This new platform offers enhanced ease of shopping and incremental functionality including an upgraded mobile experience; additional navigation and search enhancements; improved product pages with enhanced imagery, product videos, and user-generated content; and new capabilities like eGift cards and order on line, pick up in store. The new platform also gives us capabilities to create deeper customer relationships and create value through more personalization and strategic customization.
Our department store relationships allow us to expose our brand to new customers and showcase our new product assortments. We are currently in over 730 department store locations, including Macy's, Dillard's, Belk, Bon-Ton, and Von Maur. In the department stores, we are continuing to work on enhancing our brand presentation and to expand our lifestyle brand offerings.
The specialty retail channel is the heritage of our business and remains very important to us. We continue to add select accounts while discontinuing unproductive accounts. While the specialty retail business is becoming a smaller percentage of our total revenue base, it is still an important piece of our business, and we are working to stabilize it by segmenting specific products to this channel and assisting retailers with assortment planning. 
We have a small wholesale presence in Japan. We are exploring the possibility of expanding into other countries in the long-term but do not foresee any additional international country expansion in fiscal 2018.
Marketing. Marketing and brand positioning are both critical elements as we continue to engage new consumers and strengthen our bond with our existing customers. During fiscal 2017, our focus was to increase brand relevancy, desire for the brand, and purchase intent. 
We activated our new branding and brand positioning in fiscal 2017, which included updating elements of our visual identity such as our logo and further evolving our marketing to speak more directly to the Day Maker. We believe that highlighting our new product and enhancing our brand creative to assure our customer that we understand her will give the Day Maker a new reason to look at Vera Bradley. 
Well-timed and well-executed brand activation is critical to increasing our brand relevancy and increasing purchase intent.  Through comprehensive consumer research, we have designed a media plan that we believe effectively targets our Day Maker customers and attracts both lapsed and new Day Maker consumers to our brand, reaching them where they already are looking and giving them content that showcases our beautiful solutions. Our media efforts include a fully-integrated mix of digital, social, experiential, and print, with our goal being to surround the Day Maker with our brand.
Competitive Strengths
We believe the following competitive strengths differentiate us within the marketplace:
6

Strong Brand Identity and Positioning. We believe the Vera Bradley brand is highly recognized for its distinctive and vibrant style. Vera Bradley is positioned in the market as a lifestyle brand that inspires consumers to express their femininity, individuality, and sense of style. We have also positioned our brand to highlight the high quality and functional attributes of our products. The Vera Bradley brand is more price accessible than many competing brands, which allows us to attract a wide range of consumers and increases our ability to achieve repeat purchases.
Customer Loyalty. We believe we have a segment of long-term consumers who act as loyal and enthusiastic brand advocates. We believe this enthusiasm for our brand by our loyal customers inspires repeat purchases. Our customers often purchase our products as gifts for family members and friends, who we strive to turn into brand enthusiasts. 
Product Development Expertise. Our product development team combines an understanding of consumer preferences with a knowledge of color, fashion, and style trends to design our products. Our creative design associates utilize a disciplined product design process that seeks to maximize the productivity of our product releases and drive consumer demand.
Dynamic Multi-Channel Distribution Model. We offer our products through a diverse choice of shopping options across channels that are intimate, highly shop-able, fun, and characteristic of our brand. Whether they visit a Vera Bradley store, a specialty retail store, a department store, or verabradley.com, we believe consumers have an opportunity to find the brand in places that match their unique shopping interests. Our multi-channel distribution model enables us to maximize customer access to our products.
Established Network of Indirect Retailers. Our Indirect specialty retail business consists of an established and diverse network of approximately 2,600 locations. This channel, primarily located throughout the United States, includes some of the brand’s strongest advocates, and their passion has been instrumental in the development of our brand.
Unique Company Culture. We were founded in 1982 by two friends, Barbara Bradley Baekgaard and Patricia Miller, who built our business around their passion for design and commitment to customer service. We believe our founders created a unique culture that attracts passionate and motivated employees who are excited about our products and our brand. Our employees share our founders’ commitment to Vera Bradley customers. We believe that a fun, friendly, and welcoming work environment fosters creativity and collaboration and that, by empowering our employees to become personally involved in product design, testing, and marketing, they become passionate and devoted brand advocates.
Experienced Management Team. Our senior management team led by Robert Wallstrom, our Chief Executive Officer, has extensive experience across a diverse range of disciplines in product design, merchandising, marketing, store operations and development, supply chain management, and finance. 
Our Product Release Strategy
We introduce new collections approximately ten times per year. Each launch typically consists of two or three signature cotton-quilted prints, as well as other fabrications including microfiber, leather, faux leather, and Preppy Poly and patterns in Streeterville and Lighten-Up, many of which are also available in solid colors. These collections of prints and solids are incorporated into the designs of a wide range of products, including bags, accessories, and travel items. These collections typically include classic styles, updates to existing designs, and new product introductions.
To keep our assortment current and fresh, and to focus our inventory investments on our best performers, we discontinue prints and fabrications as necessary. We sell our remaining inventory of retired products primarily through our website, factory outlet stores, our annual outlet sale, and third party liquidators.

Total | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %


(1) | Includes primarily apparel/footwear, stationery, merchandising, freight, licensing revenue, and gift card breakage revenue.

Bags. Bags are a core part of our product offerings and are the primary component of every seasonal assortment. The category consists of classic and new styles developed by our product development team to meet consumer demand. Our bag product category includes items such as totes, crossbodies, satchels, clutches, backpacks, baby bags, and lunch bags. Bags play a prominent role in our visual merchandising, and we focus on showcasing the different fabrications, patterns, colors, and features of each bag.
Accessories. Accessories include fashion accessories such as wallets, wristlets, eyeglass cases, jewelry, and scarves and various technology accessories. Our accessories are attractively priced and allow the consumer to include some color in her wardrobe, even if tucked into another bag. Our product development team consistently updates the accessories assortment based on consumer demand and fashion trends.
Travel. Our travel product category includes rolling luggage, cosmetics, travel and packing accessories, and travel bags which includes our iconic duffel and weekend bags. The first Vera Bradley product offering included duffel bags, which consistently have been a strong performer. We believe their popularity, as well as the appeal of our other travel items, results from our vibrant designs, functional styles, and lightweight fabrications.
Home. Our home category includes textiles, including throw blankets, beach towels, and comforters, wellness and beauty, as well as items such as mugs and tumblers.
Product Development
We have implemented a fully integrated and cross-functional product development process that aligns design, trend and market research, merchandising, planning, sales, marketing, and sourcing. Product development is a core capability that makes our products unique. Our designs and aesthetics set our products apart and drive customer loyalty. Our design and product development teams combine an understanding of the needs of our target Day Maker customers, with knowledge of upcoming color and fashion trends, to design new collections, as well as new product categories, that will resonate in the market.
We typically begin the development stage of our products in the Vera Bradley portfolio twelve to eighteen months in advance of their release. The development of each new pattern includes the design of a primary, secondary, and sometimes a tertiary print. To seek fresh perspectives, we often collaborate with independent designers to create unique patterns for each season and also maintain an internal print design team. We oversee the development and exercise the final approval of all patterns and designs. Once developed, we generally copyright our patterns as appropriate. We believe that great design is not only central to our product development efforts, but also is a fundamental part of our brand development and growth strategies.
Our product development team works to ensure that new collections contain an assortment of products and styles that are in line with both fashion trends and Day Maker customer needs and regularly updates classic styles to enhance functionality. In addition, we actively pursue opportunities to expand our product offerings through new line and brand extensions. Our product development team monitors fashion trends and customer needs by attending major trend shows in Europe and the United States, subscribing to trend monitoring services, and engaging in comparison-shopping.

Our product development team works closely with our marketing team to gather consumer insights through seasonal market research and in-store testing. We gather seasonal market research through a variety of methodologies, including scheduled interviews and online and in-person surveys conducted by our in-house team. The design and product development teams ensure that we offer products that are constructed to meet our standards of design, function, and quality in a cost-effective manner. We believe that with our cross-functional, collaborative approach, we are able to introduce and sell our merchandise in a way that clearly communicates the Vera Bradley brand.
In addition to products developed in-house, we also pursue brand extensions through strategic partnerships and licensing agreements. We currently have strategic partnerships in place for the development of our fragrance collection and licenses in place for our eyewear, collegiate, bedding, hosiery, swim, tech, stationery, and publishing collections. We will continue to look for the right strategic partners and licensees that can augment the brand and provide established distribution networks for certain categories of business.
Marketing
We believe that the growth of our brand and our business is influenced by our ability to introduce and sell our merchandise in a way that clearly conveys the Vera Bradley brand personality. We use marketing as a critical tool in our efforts to promote our brand.
Retention Advertising. Vera Bradley communicates with our established customers consistently throughout the year with regular e-mails and seasonal direct mail catalogs, brochures, and notifications. Our retention advertising is geared to keeping Vera Bradley top of mind with our customers, rewarding our customers, and providing them with news of our seasonal launches and new product introductions. 
New Customer Acquisition Advertising. We primarily employ print and digital (i.e., display banner, mobile, geo-targeting, and pre-roll video) advertising to increase overall brand awareness and attract new customers. Our advertisements are placed in fashion, lifestyle, and family publications and websites that complement the wide breadth of appeal of our brand. Our ads have recently appeared in People StyleWatch, InStyle, Glamour, Cosmopolitan, Seventeen, and Teen Vogue.
Public Relations and Product Placement. Vera Bradley has received considerable editorial exposure in the press, with mentions in People StyleWatch, Redbook, Teen Vogue, Seventeen, O the Oprah Magazine, InStyle, and The Huffington Post. In addition, we have expanded our public relations efforts to reach popular online influencers and bloggers.
Product placement in feature-length films and on prime-time television shows remains strong with television placements in Modern Family, The Big Bang Theory, Scandal, and Fuller House. Movie placements include: La La Land, My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2, Ghostbusters, and Miracles from Heaven.
Partnerships. We work with high-profile partners to enhance our brand image and expand our customer reach. During fiscal 2017, we partnered with Madison Square Garden which, among other things, featured our new logo and video content. In fiscal 2018, we will participate in a new six-episode reality competition television show called Girl Starter which will air on TLC beginning in early April. The show will integrate our product and “It’s Good to be a Girl” marketing campaign clips. One episode will feature a challenge on which our co-founder, Barbara Bradley Baekgaard, will be a guest judge.
Social Media and Online Marketing. We use online marketing and social networking sites as tools to increase brand awareness and drive traffic to verabradley.com and to our stores. We have captured approximately 4.5 million customer e-mail addresses in our online customer file, with many of these customers providing age, occupation, and location data. This captured information provides us with deeper insight into the products and categories that are in the highest interest of our customers, and allows us to better target our customers with appropriate messages. As of January 28, 2017, we had approximately 1.7 million Facebook fans and approximately 83,000 Twitter followers. Our Instagram, which we launched in October 2012, has grown to approximately 277,000 followers and is our most highly engaged social medium. In addition, we often partner with brand-right bloggers to promote product.
Direct Mail. Seasonal Vera Bradley catalogs are a vehicle for promoting our brand and product portfolio. Each catalog is sent to a targeted customer mailing list. In addition to distributing the catalog, we produce and distribute a number of other marketing pieces, including postcards and mini-mailers. We believe our direct mail medium generates excitement and awareness about the brand and seasonal introductions and allows us to reach both new and loyal customers in their homes.

Seasonality
Because Vera Bradley products are frequently given as gifts, we have historically realized, and expect to continue to realize, higher sales and operating income in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, which includes the holiday months of November and December. In addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales. 
Channels of Distribution
We distribute our products through our Direct and Indirect segments. This multi-channel distribution model is designed to enable operational flexibility and maximizes the methods by which we can access potential customers.
Direct Segment
Full-Line Stores. We have developed a retail presence through our full-line stores, all located in the United States, which provides us with a format to showcase our brand and the full array of Vera Bradley products. As of January 28, 2017, we operated 113 full-line stores averaging approximately 1,900 square feet per store. In fiscal 2017, we opened our first flagship store in the SoHo neighborhood of New York which offers customers a unique store experience, as well as exclusive product. Our sales associates are passionate about our products and customer service, which, we believe, translates into a superior shopping experience.
Factory Outlet Stores. Our factory outlet stores are a vehicle for selling factory exclusive styles, as well as retired merchandise at discounted prices, while maintaining brand integrity. At the end of fiscal 2017, approximately 70% of the merchandise found in our factory outlet stores was factory exclusive styles. We believe our factory outlet stores are an integral part of our distribution strategy, as this format provides an additional channel of distribution for our products and enables us to better target value-oriented customers. Our factory outlet stores average approximately 3,200 square feet per store. As of January 28, 2017, we operated 46 factory outlet stores all located in the United States.
Store Location Selection Strategy. Our store location decisions for both full-line and factory outlet stores are made based upon our comprehensive retail strategy that includes actual and planned penetration in both Indirect and Direct segments, as well as existing e-commerce demand. At this time, we do not believe all geographical markets have been fully penetrated by our distribution channels. We believe that long-term expansion of our store base will increase brand awareness and reinforce our brand image. In addition to analyzing store economics, we pay particular attention to the location within the shopping center, the size and shape of the space, and desirable co-tenancies. Along with seeking co-tenants that we believe share our target customer, we seek a balanced mix of moderate and high-end retailers to encourage high levels of traffic. Our target full-line store size is approximately 1,800 square feet, but we are able to work with spaces as small as 1,000 square feet or, depending on our market strategy and relevant economic factors, spaces as large as 2,800 square feet. Our target factory outlet store size is approximately 3,000 square feet.
Store Operations. The focus of our store operations is providing consumers with a comfortable and memorable shopping experience. We strive to make the experience interactive through special store events, such as showcasing newly launched products or celebrating our namesake’s birthday. Our customer service philosophy emphasizes friendly service, merchandise knowledge, and passion for the brand. Consequently, an essential requirement for the success of our stores is our ability to attract, train, and retain talented, highly motivated district managers, store managers, and sales associates. 
Store Economics. We expect our full-line stores to average approximately 1,800 square feet per store, and we expect to invest approximately $0.4 million per new store, consisting of inventory costs, pre-opening costs, and build-out costs, less tenant-improvement allowances.
We expect our factory outlet stores to average approximately 3,000 square feet per store, and we expect to invest approximately $0.4 million per new store, consisting of inventory costs, pre-opening costs, and build-out costs, less tenant-improvement allowances.
E-Commerce. In 2006, we began selling our products through the verabradley.com website. The objective of verabradley.com is to provide both a mechanism for marketing directly to consumers and a storefront where consumers can find the entire full-line Vera Bradley collection. Since fiscal 2013, we have continually invested in upgrades to our website allowing for a more user friendly homepage, enabling us to ship internationally, enhancing the checkout experience, adding product recommendations, enhancing product descriptions, adding silhouettes for product scale, generating cart and site abandonment emails, gathering and analyzing customer feedback, and enhancing our search capabilities. To continue to enhance our website engagement, we completed a redesign and conversion of our website to a new platform in February 2017. This new platform offers enhanced ease of shopping and incremental functionality including an upgraded mobile experience; additional navigation and search 
10

enhancements; improved product pages with enhanced imagery, product videos, and user-generated content; and new capabilities like eGift cards and order on line, pick up in store. We had approximately 53 million visits to verabradley.com during fiscal 2017.
Annual Outlet Sale. Our annual outlet sale is held in the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum Exposition Center in Fort Wayne, Indiana. The annual outlet sale is an important tradition for Vera Bradley, has many loyal followers, and is an opportunity for us to sell our retired merchandise at discounted prices in a brand-right fashion. We attracted approximately 50,000 attendees to our 2016 annual outlet sale.
Indirect Segment
As of January 28, 2017, we sold our products in approximately 2,600 specialty retail locations, the majority of which we have had long-standing relationships, as well as department stores, national accounts, third party e-commerce sites, our wholesale customer in Japan and third-party inventory liquidators. In fiscal 2012, we launched our products in the department store channel. We are currently in over 730 department store locations, including approximately 350 Macy's locations, approximately 270 Dillard's, over 40 Belk, over 40 Bon-Ton, and approximately 30 Von Maur locations. 
The top 30% of our specialty retailers account for approximately 70% of total specialty retailer revenue. No single Indirect retailer represented more than 10% of consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2017, with the top ten Indirect retailers representing in the aggregate approximately 40% of total Indirect net revenues. The majority of our Indirect retailers have been customers for over five years. 
Indirect Sales Force
We believe that having an in-house field sales force results in more consistent brand presentation and messaging, enhanced support for our Indirect customers, and a more predictable, scalable, and cost-efficient business model. As of January 28, 2017, our sales team consisted of approximately 40 in-house, full-time sales consultants. The compensation structure for our sales consultants consists of a combination of fixed pay and sales-based incentives.
In addition to acquiring new and growing existing accounts, our sales consultants serve as a support center for our Indirect customers by assisting and educating them in areas such as merchandising and visual presentation, marketing the brand, product selection, and inventory management. Our visual merchandising program provides our sales consultants with a framework to guide our Indirect customers regarding optimal product placement and display that is intended to reinforce the message that our brand is distinct from those of our competitors.
Manufacturing and Supply Chain Model
Our multi-country manufacturing and supply chain model is designed to achieve efficient, timely, and accurate order fulfillment while maintaining appropriate levels of inventory.
Our manufacturing and sourcing strategy is part of the larger cross-functional product development process. The overall objective for our sourcing team is to build and sustain collaborative partnerships throughout our supply chain, with a focus on identifying appropriate countries and partners to manufacture our products. The sourcing team leverages its expertise in negotiation, relationship management, and change management to maintain a strong global supply chain.
We strive to maintain the appropriate balance of inventory to enable us to provide a high level of service to our customers, including prompt and accurate delivery of our products. We have an active and nimble sales and operations planning process that helps us balance the supply and demand issues that we encounter in our business, optimize our inventory levels, and anticipate inventory needs. We have also integrated our planning, forecasting, and segmentation processes under one function called Merchandise Planning and Allocation.
Approximately half of our products are cotton-based. Our other fabrics include nylon, polyester, microfiber, leather, and faux leather. We source our materials from various suppliers in Asia, with the majority coming from China and South Korea. Our global sourcing team works with select suppliers enabling us to optimize the mix of cost, lead time, quality, and reliability within our global supply network. All of our suppliers must comply with our quality standards, and we use only a limited number of pre-approved suppliers who have demonstrated a commitment to delivering the highest quality products. In April 2016, we opened an office in Hong Kong to lead the global supply chain in Asia, including the oversight of sourcing and procurement.
11

The majority of our finished goods, not sourced through licenses or strategic partners, are manufactured by a variety of global manufacturers located primarily in China, Vietnam and Cambodia. We are not dependent upon any single manufacturer for our products. When determining the size of orders placed with our manufacturers, we take into account forward-looking demand, lead times for specific products, current inventory levels, and minimum order quantity requirements. Overseas production has resulted in substantial cost savings and a reduction of capital investment. With the oversight of our office in Hong Kong and our independent contractors, we believe these financial benefits have been realized without sacrificing the level of quality inherent in our products or service to our customers.
Distribution Center
In 2007, we consolidated our warehousing and shipping functions into one distribution center, located in Roanoke, Indiana. In fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2015, we expanded the facility by 200,000 and 10,000 square-feet, respectively, which resulted in a total distribution center space of 428,500 square-feet. This automated, computerized facility allows Vera Bradley employees to receive information directly from the order-collection center and quickly identify the products and quantities necessary for a particular order. The expansion resulted in capacity gains in the areas of inbound receiving, inventory storage, order fulfillment, value-add processing, and shipping. The facility’s technology enables us to more accurately process and pack orders, as well as track shipments and inventory. We believe that our systems for the processing and shipment of orders from our distribution center have enabled us to improve our overall customer service through enhanced order accuracy and reduced turnaround time. 
Our products are shipped primarily via third-party common carriers to our stores, our Indirect retailers, and department stores, and directly to our customers who purchase through our website. We believe we are positioned well to support the order fulfillment requirements of our business, including business generated through our website.
Management Information Systems
We believe that high levels of automation and technology are essential to maintain our competitive position. We maintain computer hardware, systems applications, and networks to enhance and accelerate the design process, to support the sale and distribution of our products to our customers, and to improve the integration and efficiency of our operations. Our management information systems are designed to provide, among other things, comprehensive order processing, production, accounting, and management information for the product development, retail, sales, marketing, distribution, finance, and human resources functions of our business. We use several systems, including MICROS-Retail, SAP, JDA, and SCALE for our information technology requirements.
Competition
We face strong competition in each of the product lines and markets in which we compete. We believe that all of our products are in similar competitive positions with respect to the number of competitors they face and the level of competition within each product line. Due to the number of different products we offer, it is not practicable for us to quantify the number of competitors we face. Our products compete with other branded products within their product categories and with private label products sold by retailers. In our Indirect business, we compete with numerous manufacturers, importers, and distributors of handbags, accessories, and other products for the limited space available for the display of such products to the consumer. Moreover, the general availability of contract manufacturing allows new entrants access to the markets in which we compete, which may increase the number of competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business. In our Direct business, we compete against other independent retailers, department stores, catalog retailers, gift retailers, and Internet businesses that engage in the retail sale of similar products.
The market for handbags, in particular, is highly competitive. Our competitors include not only established companies that are expanding their production and marketing of handbags, but also frequent new entrants to the market. We directly compete with wholesalers and direct sellers of branded handbags and accessories, such as Coach, Michael Kors, Nine West, Dooney & Bourke, Kate Spade, Fossil, Brahmin, and Tory Burch.
In varying degrees, depending on the product category involved, we compete on the basis of design (aesthetic appeal), quality (construction), function, price point, distribution, and brand positioning. We believe that our primary competitive advantages are consumer recognition of our brand, customer loyalty, product development expertise, and our widespread presence through our multi-channel distribution model. Some of our competitors have achieved significant recognition for their brand names or have substantially greater financial, distribution, marketing, and other resources than we do. Further, we may face new competitors and increased competition from existing competitors as we expand into new markets and increase our presence in existing markets.

Copyrights and Trademarks
The development of new patterns includes the design of primary and secondary prints. Once developed, we generally copyright our patterns as appropriate. We currently have approximately 820 copyrights.
We also own all of the material trademark rights used in connection with the production, marketing, and distribution of all of our products, both in the United States and in the other countries in which our products are principally sold. Our trademarks include “Vera Bradley.” We aggressively police our trademarks and copyrights and pursue infringers and counterfeiters both domestically and internationally. Our trademarks will remain in existence for as long as we continue to use and renew them in advance of their expiration dates. We have no material patents.
Employees
As of January 28, 2017, we had approximately 3,100 employees. Of the total, approximately 2,450 were engaged in retail selling positions, approximately 315 were engaged in distribution, sourcing and quality functions, approximately 35 were engaged in product design, and approximately 300 were engaged in corporate support and administrative functions. None of our employees are represented by a union. We believe that our relations with our employees are good, and we have never encountered a significant work stoppage.
Government Regulation
Many of our imported products are subject to existing or potential duties, tariffs, or quotas that may limit the quantity of products that we may import into the United States and other countries or impact the cost of such products. To date, we have not been restricted by quotas in the operation of our business, and customs duties have not comprised a material portion of the total cost of a majority of our products. In addition, we are subject to foreign governmental regulation and trade restrictions, including U.S. retaliation against prohibited foreign practices, with respect to our product sourcing and international sales operations.
We are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations governing environmental matters, including the handling, transportation, and disposal of our products and our non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges to air, surface water, and groundwater. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action, penalties, or the imposition of other liabilities. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect upon our earnings or financial position. If we violate any laws or regulations, however, it could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance.
