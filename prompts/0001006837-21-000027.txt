ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Unless the context otherwise requires, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, "HC2," means HC2 Holdings, Inc. and the "Company," "we" and "our" mean HC2 together with its consolidated subsidiaries. 
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements. See "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."
General
HC2 is a diversified holding company that has a portfolio of subsidiaries in a variety of operating segments. We seek to grow these businesses so that they can generate long-term sustainable free cash flow and attractive returns in order to maximize value for all stakeholders. As of December 31, 2020, our four reportable operating segments, plus our Other segment, based on management’s organization of the enterprise included Infrastructure, Life Sciences, Spectrum, Insurance and Other, which includes businesses that do not meet the separately reportable segment thresholds.
Our principal operating subsidiaries include the following assets:
(i)DBM Global Inc. ("DBMG") (Infrastructure), a family of companies providing fully integrated structural and steel construction services;
(ii)Pansend Life Sciences, LLC ("Pansend") (Life Sciences), our subsidiary focused on supporting healthcare and biotechnology product development; 
(iii)HC2 Broadcasting Holdings Inc. and its subsidiaries ("HC2 Broadcasting") (Spectrum), a strategic acquirer and operator of Over-The-Air ("OTA") broadcasting stations across the United States ("U.S.") and Puerto Rico. In addition, Spectrum, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, HC2 Network Inc. ("Network"), operates Azteca America, a Spanish-language broadcast network offering high quality Hispanic content to a diverse demographic across the United States; and
(iv)Continental Insurance Group Ltd. ("CIG") (Insurance), a platform for our run-off long-term care and life and annuity business, through its insurance company, Continental General Insurance Company ("CGI" or the "Insurance Company"); 
(v)Other, which represents all other businesses or investments that do not meet the definition of a segment individually or in the aggregate. 
We expect to focus on operating and managing our portfolio of companies and building value in Infrastructure, Life Sciences and Spectrum in the future. We believe these segments are well positioned to take advantage of current trends in today’s economy and that there is opportunity to build value organically and inorganically in these three segments. We will consider opportunities outside of these businesses in the longer term to acquire and invest in businesses with attractive assets that we consider to be undervalued or fairly valued.
Overall Business Strategy
We evaluate strategic and business alternatives, which may include the following: operating, growing or acquiring additional assets or businesses related to our current or historical operations; or winding down or selling our existing operations (including our Insurance segment), or, in the longer-term, acquiring assets or businesses unrelated to our current or historical operations. We will generally pursue either controlling positions in durable, cash-flow generating businesses, assets that will enhance our current businesses or companies we believe exhibit substantial growth potential in Infrastructure, Life Sciences and Spectrum. We may choose to actively assemble or re-assemble a company’s management team to ensure the appropriate expertise is in place to execute the operating objectives of such business. We view ourselves as strategic and financial partners and seek to align our management teams’ incentives with our goal of delivering sustainable long-term value to our stakeholders. 
As part of any acquisition strategy, we may raise capital in the form of debt or equity securities (including preferred stock) or a combination thereof. We have broad discretion in selecting a business strategy for the Company. If we elect to pursue an acquisition, while we intend to focus on Infrastructure, Life Science and Spectrum, we have broad discretion in identifying and selecting both the industry and the possible acquisition or business combination opportunity. In connection with evaluating these strategic and business alternatives, we may at any time be engaged in ongoing discussions with respect to possible acquisitions, business combinations and debt or equity securities offerings of widely varying sizes. There can be no assurance that any of these discussions will result in a definitive agreement and if they do, what the terms or timing of any agreement would be. 
Competition
From a strategic perspective, we encounter competition for acquisition and business opportunities from other entities having similar business objectives, such as strategic investors and private equity firms, which could lead to higher prices for acquisition targets. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and executing transactions directly or through affiliates. Our financial resources and human resources may be relatively limited when contrasted with many of these competitors which may place us at a competitive disadvantage. Competitive conditions affecting our operating businesses are described in the discussions below.
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 2,803 employees, including the employees of our operating businesses as described in more detail below. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
Our Operating Subsidiaries
Infrastructure Segment (DBMG)
DBM Global Inc. is a fully integrated Industrial Construction, Structural Steel, and Facility Maintenance provider who provides 3D Building Information Modeling ("BIM"), detailing, fabrication, and erection of structural steel and heavy steel plate, heavy mechanical and facility maintenance services. DBMG provides these services on commercial, industrial, and infrastructure construction projects such as high- and low-rise buildings and office complexes, hotels and casinos, convention centers, sports arenas and stadiums, shopping malls, hospitals, dams, bridges, mines, metal processing, refineries, pulp and paper mills, and power plants. DBMG also fabricates trusses and girders and specializes in the fabrication and erection of large-diameter water pipe and water storage tanks. Through its Aitken business ("Aitken"), DBMG manufactures pollution control scrubbers, tunnel liners, pressure vessels, strainers, filters, separators and a variety of customized products. Through its GrayWolf Industrial business ("GrayWolf"), DBMG also provides integrated solutions for digital engineering, modeling and detailing, construction, heavy equipment installation and facility services including maintenance, repair, and installation to a diverse range of end markets. Headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, DBMG has domestic operations in Alabama, Arizona, California, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, and Washington with construction projects primarily located in the aforementioned states. In addition, through its DBM Vircon business (“DBM Vircon”), DBMG also has international operations located in Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand, and the United Kingdom, providing steel detailing, rebar detailing, BIM modeling, and BIM management services.
DBMG’s results of operations are affected primarily by (i) the level of commercial, industrial and infrastructure construction as well as the need for mechanical and maintenance services in its principal markets; (ii) its ability to win project contracts; (iii) the number and complexity of project changes requested by customers or general contractors; (iv) its success in utilizing its resources at or near full capacity; and (v) its ability to complete contracts on a timely and cost-effective basis. The level of commercial, industrial and infrastructure construction activity is related to several factors, including local, regional and national economic conditions, interest rates, availability of financing, and the supply of existing facilities relative to demand.
Strategy
DBMG’s objective is to achieve and maintain a leading position in the geographic regions and project segments that it serves by providing timely, high-quality services to its customers. DBMG pursues this objective with a strategy comprised of the following components:
•Pursue Large, Value-Added Design-Build Projects: DBMG’s unique ability to offer design-build services, a full range of steel construction services and project management capabilities makes it a preferred partner for complex, design-build fabrication projects in the geographic regions it serves. This capability often enables DBMG to bid against fewer competitors in a less traditional, more negotiated selection process on these kinds of projects, thereby offering the potential for higher margins while providing overall cost savings and project flexibility and efficiencies to its customers;
•Expand and Diversify Revenue Base: DBMG is seeking to expand and diversify its revenue base by leveraging its long-term relationships with national and multi-national construction and engineering firms, national and regional accounts and other customers. DBMG also intends to continue to grow its operations by targeting smaller projects that carry higher margins and less risk of large margin fluctuations. DBMG believes that continuing to diversify its revenue base by completing smaller projects, such as low-rise office buildings, healthcare facilities and other commercial and industrial structures, could reduce the impact of periodic adverse market or economic conditions, as well as the margin slippage that may accompany larger projects;
•Emphasize Innovative Services: DBMG focuses its BIM modeling, design-build, engineering, detailing, fabrication and erection expertise on larger, more complex projects, where it typically experiences less competition and more advantageous negotiated contract opportunities. DBMG has extensive experience in providing services requiring complex BIM modeling, detailing, fabrication and erection techniques and other unusual project needs, such as BIM coordination, specialized transportation, steel treatment or specialty coating applications. These service capabilities have enabled DBMG to address such design-sensitive projects as stadiums and uniquely designed hotels and casinos; and
•Diversify Customer and Product Base: Although DBMG seeks to achieve a leading share of the geographic and product markets in which it traditionally competes, it also seeks to diversify its product offerings and geographic markets through acquisition. By expanding the portfolio of products offered and geographic markets served, DBMG believes that it will be able to offer more value-added services to existing and new potential customers, as well as to reduce the impact of periodic adverse market or economic conditions.
•Ensure Project Delivery Success through Predictive Technologies: DBMG uses resources including data analytics, modeling and detailing, laser scan to BIM, and augmented and virtual reality to provide fully integrated solutions for a project’s lifecycle, from design through fabrication, construction, and mechanical and facility services. DBMG is thus able to deliver optimal value and reliable outcomes that are on schedule and on budget.
Services and Customers
DBMG consists of four business units spread across diverse markets: Schuff Steel Company ("SSC") (steel fabrication and erection), DBM Vircon ("DBM Vircon") (steel detailing, rebar detailing, bridge detailing, BIM modeling services and BIM management services), the Aitken product line ("Aitken") (manufacturing of equipment for the oil and gas industry) and GrayWolf (specialty facility maintenance, repair, and installation services, as well as management of smaller structural steel projects). For the year ended December 31, 2020 revenues were as follows (in millions): 

 | Revenue | | % of Total Revenue
SSC | $ | 436.3 | | | 64.5 | %
GrayWolf | 192.9 | | | 28.5 | % 
DBM Vircon | 40.6 | | | 6.0 | % 
Aitken | 6.8 | | | 1.0 | % 
Total | $ | 676.6 | | | 100.0 | %

The majority of DBMG's business is in North America, but DBM Vircon provides detailing services on five continents, and SSC provides fabricated steel to Canada and other select countries. In 2020, DBMG's two largest customers represented approximately 18.6% of revenues. In 2019, DBMG’s two largest customers represented approximately 20.2% of revenues.
DBMG’s size gives it the production capacity to complete large-scale, demanding projects, with typical utilization per facility ranging from 75%-88% and a sales pipeline that includes over $857 million in potential revenue generation. DBMG believes it has benefited from being one of the largest players in a market that is highly fragmented across many small firms.
DBMG achieves a highly efficient and cost-effective construction process by focusing on collaborating with all project participants and utilizing its extensive design-build and design-assist capabilities with its clients. Additionally, DBMG has in-house fabrication and erection combined with access to a network of subcontractors for smaller projects in order to provide high-quality solutions for its customers. DBMG offers a range of services across a broad geography through its ten fabrication shops in the United States and 29 sales and management facilities located in the United States, Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand and the UK.
DBMG operates with minimal bonding requirements, with a current balance of 23% of DBMG's backlog (out of a total backlog of $394.5 million) as of December 31, 2020, and bonding is reduced as projects are billed, rather than upon completion. DBMG has limited its raw material cost exposure by securing fixed prices from mills at contract bid, as well as by utilizing its purchasing power as one of the largest domestic buyers of wide flange beams in the United States.
SSC offers a variety of services to its customers which it believes enhances its ability to obtain and successfully complete projects. These services fall into six distinct groups: design-assist/design-build, pre-construction design and budgeting, steel management, fabrication, erection, and BIM:

Suppliers
DBMG currently purchases its steel from a variety of domestic and foreign steel producers but is not dependent on any one producer. During the year ended December 31, 2020, DBMG, through SSC, purchased approximately 53% of the total value of steel and steel components purchased from two domestic steel vendors. See Item 1A - Risk Factors - "Risks Related to the Infrastructure segment" elsewhere in this document for discussion on DBMG’s reliance on suppliers of steel and steel components. 
Sales and Distributions
DBMG obtains contracts through competitive bidding or negotiation, which generally are fixed-price, cost-plus, unit cost, or time and material arrangements. Bidding and negotiations require DBMG to estimate the costs of the project up front, with most projects typically lasting from one to 12 months. However, large and more complex projects can often last two years or more.
Marketing
Sales managers lead DBMG’s sales and marketing efforts. Each sales manager is primarily responsible for estimating sales and marketing efforts in defined geographic areas. In addition, DBMG employs full-time project estimators and chief estimators. DBMG’s sales representatives build and maintain relationships with general contractors, architects, engineers and other potential sources of business to identify potential new projects. DBMG generates future project reports to track the weekly progress of new opportunities. DBMG’s sales efforts are further supported by most of its executive officers and engineering personnel, who have substantial experience in the design, detailing, modeling, fabrication and erection of structural steel and heavy steel plate.
DBMG competes for new project opportunities through its relationships and interaction with its active and prospective customer base which provides valuable current market information and sales opportunities. In addition, DBMG is often contacted by governmental agencies in connection with public construction projects, and by large private-sector project owners, general contractors and engineering firms in connection with new building projects such as manufacturing and industrial plants, data centers, warehouse and distribution centers, and other industrial and commercial facilities.
Upon selection of projects to bid or price, DBMG’s estimating departments review and prepare projected costs of shop, field, detail drawing preparation and crane hours, steel and other raw materials, and other costs. With respect to bid projects, a formal bid is prepared detailing the specific services and materials DBMG plans to provide, along with payment terms and project completion timelines. Upon acceptance, DBMG’s bid proposal is finalized in a definitive contract.
Competition
The principal geographic and product markets DBMG serves are highly competitive, and this intense competition is expected to continue. DBMG competes with other contractors for commercial, industrial and specialty projects on a local, regional, or national basis. Continued service within these markets requires substantial resources and capital investment in equipment, technology and skilled personnel, and certain of DBMG’s competitors have financial and operating resources greater than DBMG. Competition also places downward pressure on DBMG’s contract prices and margins. The principal competitive factors within the industry are price, timeliness of project completion, quality, reputation, and the desire of customers to utilize specific contractors with whom they have favorable relationships and prior experience. While DBMG believes that it maintains a competitive advantage with respect to many of these factors, failure to continue to do so or to meet other competitive challenges could have a material adverse effect on DBMG’s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2020, DBMG employed approximately 2,530 people across the globe, including the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, Philippines, Thailand, and the UK. The number of persons DBMG employs on an hourly basis fluctuates directly in relation to the amount of business DBMG performs. Certain of the fabrication and erection personnel DBMG employs are represented by the United Steelworkers of America and the International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers Union. DBMG is a party to several separate collective bargaining agreements with these unions in certain of its current operating regions, which expire (if not renewed) at various times in the future. Approximately 28% of DBMG’s employees are covered under various collective bargaining agreements. As of December 31, 2020, most of DBMG’s collective bargaining agreements are subject to automatic annual or other renewal unless either party elects to terminate the agreement on the scheduled expiration date. DBMG considers its relationship with its employees to be satisfactory and, other than sporadic and unauthorized work stoppages of an immaterial nature, none of which have been related to its own labor relations, DBMG has not experienced a work stoppage or other labor disturbance.
DBMG strategically utilizes third-party fabrication and erection subcontractors on many of its projects and also subcontracts detailing services from time to time when its management determines that this would be economically beneficial (and/or when DBMG requires additional capacity for such services). DBMG’s inability to engage fabrication, erection and detailing subcontractors on favorable terms could limit its ability to complete projects in a timely manner or compete for new projects, which could have a material adverse effect on its operations.
Legal, Environmental and Insurance
DBMG is subject to claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Such matters are inherently uncertain, and there can be no guarantee that the outcome of any such matter will be decided favorably to DBMG or that the resolution of any such matter will not have a material adverse effect upon DBMG or the Company’s business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Neither DBMG nor the Company believes that any of such pending claims and legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its (or the Company’s) business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
DBMG’s operations and properties are affected by numerous federal, state and local environmental protection laws and regulations, such as those governing discharges to air and water and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. These laws and regulations have become increasingly stringent and compliance with these laws and regulations has become increasingly complex and costly. There can be no assurance that such laws and regulations or their interpretation will not change in a manner that could materially and adversely affect DBMG’s operations. Certain environmental laws, such as CERCLA (the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act) and its state law counterparts, provide for strict and joint and several liability for investigation and remediation of spills and other releases of toxic and hazardous substances. These laws may apply to conditions at properties currently or formerly owned or operated by an entity or its predecessors, as well as to conditions at properties at which wastes or other contamination attributable to an entity or its predecessors come to be located. Although DBMG has not incurred any material environmental related liability in the past and believes that it is in material compliance with environmental laws, there can be no assurance that DBMG, or entities for which it may be responsible, will not incur such liability in connection with the investigation and remediation of facilities it currently operates (or formerly owned or operated) or other locations in a manner that could materially and adversely affect its operations.
DBMG maintains commercial general liability insurance in the amount of $1.0 million per occurrence and $2.0 million in the aggregate. In addition, DBMG maintains umbrella coverage limits of $75.0 million. DBMG also maintains insurance against property damage caused by fire, flood, explosion and similar catastrophic events that may result in physical damage or destruction of its facilities and property. DBM maintains professional liability insurance in the amount of $10.0 million for professional services related to our work in steel erection and fabrication projects. 
All policies are subject to various deductibles and coverage limitations. Although DBMG’s management believes that its insurance is adequate for its present needs, there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain adequate insurance at premium rates that management considers commercially reasonable, nor can there be any assurance that such coverage will be adequate to cover all claims that may arise.

MediBeacon, Inc.
MediBeacon, Inc. ("MediBeacon") develops proprietary non-invasive real-time monitoring system for the evaluation of kidney function. Current methods to evaluate kidney function are indirect estimates that may be inaccurate and are not real-time. Chronic kidney disease is estimated to affect more than 850 million people worldwide.
MediBeacon’s Transdermal GFR Measurement System (“TGFR”), which uses an optical skin sensor combined with Lumitrace, a proprietary agent that glows in the presence of light, will be the first non-invasive system to enable real-time, direct monitoring of kidney function at point-of-care. On October 22, 2018, the FDA granted Breakthrough Device designation to the TGFR for the measurement of Glomerular Filtration Rate (“GFR”) in patients with impaired or normal kidney function. Under the Breakthrough Device program, the FDA works with companies to expedite regulatory review in order to give patients more timely access to innovative diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. MediBeacon is expected to begin its U.S. pivotal study in the second half of 2021. 
In 2019, MediBeacon closed its Series B financing round with its strategic partner, Huadong, providing Huadong with exclusive rights to MediBeacon’s portfolio of assets in Greater China in exchange for a staged $30 million investment. Further, Huadong will be responsible for funding clinical trials, commercial and regulatory activities in 25 countries in the Asia-Pacific region, including Greater China. In exchange, MediBeacon will receive royalty payments on net sales of the TGFR system. As of December 31, 2020, MediBeacon has received $15 million from Huadong at a pre-money valuation of approximately $300 million. Contingent upon the regulatory approval of the TGFR system by the FDA, Huadong will make a second $15 million investment at a pre-money valuation of approximately $400 million. In 2020, Huadong amended its commercial agreement, which will provide an additional $20 million pre-payment of future China royalties over the next two years to pursue Class 1 status in China, allowing the device to immediately enter the Chinese hospital system. As of December 31, 2020, MediBeacon has received approximately $10 million to include China in MediBeacon's global pivotal study.
MediBeacon is also exploring additional clinical applications of the patented Lumitrace technology, including: 
1.Gastrointestinal permeability, which has the potential to transform management of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including Crohn’s disease. Grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, in collaboration with scientists at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and the Mayo Clinic, have supported MediBeacon’s research in this area. During 2020, the first in-human clinical studies were conducted to establish the feasibility of fluorescent tracer agent-based systems to quantify the permeability of the gastrointestinal tract in patients with active Crohn’s disease.
2.Ocular angiography, which has the potential to diagnose and monitor vasculature leakage in the eye, a key factor in diagnosing and monitoring various diseases, including macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy and retinal vasculitis while avoiding current potential clinical side effects such as allergic reactions, nausea and vomiting. MediBeacon was the recipient of a Small Business Innovation Research grant supported by the National Eye Institute of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). With this support, MediBeacon is pursuing research into the use of a MediBeacon fluorescent tracer agent to visualize vasculature in the eye, having recently received FDA approval in 2020 to begin clinical studies.

Broadcast Operations
HC2 Broadcasting carries more than 70 networks on its stations, distributing content across the U.S. Broadcasting provides free OTA programming to television viewing audiences in the communities it serves. The programming Broadcasting distributes includes networks targeting shopping, weather, sports and entertainment programming, as well as religious networks and networks targeting select ethnic groups.
Revenues 
Broadcast station revenue is generated primarily from the sale of television airtime in return for a fixed fee or a portion of the related ad sales. In a typical broadcast station revenue agreement, the owner of a station makes available, for a fee, airtime on a station subchannel to a third party.  The third party broadcasts during that airtime and collects revenue from advertising aired during such content. Broadcast station revenue is recognized over the life of the contract. The fees charged can be fixed or variable and the contracts that the Company enters into are generally short-term in nature. Variable fees are usage/sales-based and are recognized as revenue when the subsequent usage occurs. 
Network advertising revenue is generated primarily from the sale of television airtime for advertisements or paid programming. Network advertising inventory is sold in the upfront and scatter markets and is offered at market rates, based on a number of factors such as available inventory, network programming and ratings, and economic conditions. In the upfront market, advertisers buy advertising time for the upcoming season. In the scatter market, advertisers buy advertising time close to when the commercials will be run and varies quarter over quarter. In some cases, the network advertising sales are subject to impressions guarantees that require the Company to provide additional advertising time if the guaranteed audience levels are not achieved. Network advertising revenue is recognized when advertising spots are aired, and as impression guarantees, if any, are achieved. Impressions are defined as the number of times that an advertisement is viewed by users. The achievement of performance guarantees is based on audience viewership from an independent research company. If there is a guarantee to deliver a targeted audience number of impressions, revenues are recognized based on the proportion of the audience impressions delivered to the total guaranteed in the contract. 
For the local inventory the Company sells national spot advertising and local advertising. National spot advertising represents time sold to advertisers that advertise in more than one DMA. Local advertising revenue is generated from local merchants and service providers. National and local advertising spots are generally sold without guaranteed ratings, and revenue is recognized when spots are aired.
Network distribution revenue consists of fees charged and payments received from cable, satellite and other multiple video program distribution (“MVPD”) systems for their retransmission of our network content. The Company’s network is aired on MVPDs pursuant to multi-year carriage agreements that provide for the level of carriage that the Company’s network will receive. Carriage of the network is generally determined by package, such as whether the network is included in the more widely distributed, general entertainment packages offered or lesser-distributed, specialized packages, such as U.S. Hispanic-targeted or Spanish language package. Network distribution revenue is determined on the contractual rate-per-subscriber negotiated in the agreements, the average number of subscribers that receive content, and the market demand for the content that the Company provides. Network distribution fees received from MVPDs are recognized as revenue in the period that services are provided. 
Strategy
HC2 Broadcasting’s strategy includes the following initiatives:
•HC2 Broadcasting is principally designed to be a nationwide OTA distribution platform, targeting the growing number of OTA households in the U.S.;
•HC2 Broadcasting's vision is to capitalize on the opportunities to bring valuable content to more viewers over-the-air and to position itself for the changing media landscape and to take advantage of the technology advances rapidly underway in the industry. 
•As of December 31, 2020, 203 operating stations are connected to HC2 Broadcasting's cloud-based IP backbone, can be operated and monitored remotely, allowing for substantial cost savings and operating efficiencies. In 2018, FCC deregulation in TV broadcasting has eliminated the need for full time employees and studio facilities in markets where HC2 Broadcasting operates Full-Power and Class A stations, thus allowing HC2 Broadcasting to operate these stations remotely at greater cost efficiency;
•HC2 Broadcasting's major focus is to attract the highest quality content providers looking for nationwide distribution. With its national footprint and cloud-based infrastructure, HC2 Broadcasting also expects to realize premium pricing for content distribution; 
•HC2 Broadcasting's growing revenue source is from providing national carriage to content providers. Pricing carriage contracts is in part determined by the signal contour of the broadcast station and the number of OTA TV households in a given market, as well as market supply and demand; and,
•As an anchor network tenant, Azteca America is distributed on the HC2 Broadcasting platform in 60+ markets.
New Broadcast TV Technology: ATSC 3.0
In 2017, the FCC approved ATSC 3.0, next generation broadcast standards defining how television signals are broadcast and interpreted. ATSC 3.0 is an enhancement to previous broadcast standards, providing enhanced picture and audio quality, mobility, addressability, increased capacity, and IP connectivity. ATSC 3.0 will offer a platform to merge linear programming and non-TV data services alongside OTA and over-the-top ("OTT"). Among the many emerging opportunities will be hyper-local news, weather, and traffic; dynamic ad insertion; geographic and demographic targeted advertising; customizable content; better measurement and analytics; the ability to share data with devices connected to the Internet; flexibility to add streams as needed; an ultra-high definition picture quality with enhanced immersive audio; and connectivity to automobiles. In addition, ATSC 3.0 will provide new emergency capabilities including advanced alerting functions which can relay evacuation routes and device wake-up features. Many of these features will be available to mobile devices.
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, HC2 Broadcasting employed approximately 58 people across the U.S.
See Note 22. Operating Segment and Related Information for additional detail regarding our Segment's operations and financial information.
Insurance Segment (Continental Insurance Group Ltd.) 
CIG currently provides long-term care, life, annuity, and other accident and health coverage to approximately 124,000 individuals through CGI. The benefits provided by CIG's insurance operations help protect policy and certificate holders from the financial hardships associated with illness, injury, loss of life, or income discontinuation. 
CIG has a concentrated focus on long-term care insurance and is committed to the continued delivery of best-practice services as established by CIG’s insurance operations to its policy and certificate holders. Through investments in technology, a commitment to attracting, developing and retaining best-in-class insurance professionals, a dedication to continuing process improvements, and a focus on strategic growth, we believe CIG is well equipped to maintain and improve the level of service provided to its customers and assume a leading role in the long-term care industry.
CIG’s plan is to leverage its existing platform and industry expertise to identify strategic growth opportunities for managing closed blocks of long-term care business. Growth opportunities are expected to come from:
•Future acquisitions of long-term care businesses and/or closed blocks of long-term care policies;
•Reinsurance arrangements; 
•Third party administration arrangements; and
•Strategically diversifying into other product lines.
Products
Long-Term Care Insurance
CIG's long-term care insurance products pay a benefit that is either a specified daily indemnity amount or reimbursement of actual charges up to a daily maximum for long-term care services provided in the insured’s home or in assisted living or nursing facilities. Benefits begin after a waiting period, usually 90 days or less, and are generally paid for a period of three years, six years, or the policy holder's lifetime.
Substantially all of the in-force long-term care insurance policies were sold after 1995, with all sales then being discontinued in January 2010. Policies were issued in all states except for New York, with Texas being the largest issue state with approximately 20% of the business. The existing block of policies includes both individual and group products, but all individuals were individually underwritten. CIG's long-term care insurance products were sold on a guaranteed renewable basis which allows us to re-price in-force policies, subject to regulatory approval. Profitability of CIG's long-term care block is affected by premium rate increases, persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses. As part of CIG's strategy for its long-term care insurance business, management has been implementing, and expects to continue to pursue, significant premium rate increases on its blocks of business as actuarially justified. Premium rates vary by age and are based on assumptions concerning morbidity, mortality, persistency, administrative expenses, and investment yields. CIG develops its assumptions based on its own claims and persistency experience and published industry tables.
Life Insurance and Annuities
CIG's life insurance products include Traditional, Term, Universal, and Interest Sensitive Life Insurance. Its annuity products include Flexible and Single Premium Deferred Annuities. CIG's life insurance business provides a personal financial safety net for individuals and their families. These products provide protection against financial hardship after the death of an insured. Some of these products also offer a savings element that can help accumulate funds to meet future financial needs. Annuities are long-term retirement saving instruments that benefit from income accruing on a tax-deferred basis. The issuer of the annuity collects premiums, credits interest or earnings on the policy and pays out a benefit upon death, surrender or annuitization. All life insurance and annuity products are closed to new business. The life insurance products were issued with both full and simplified underwriting.
Other Accident & Health
CIG’s accident and health products, other than Long-Term Care Insurance, include accidental death, accidental death and dismemberment disability income, hospital expense, hospital indemnity, and major medical individual insurance policies. These products provide from partial reimbursement to full reimbursement of covered medical and related expenses. All products were sold prior to the introduction of the Affordable Care Act and these product lines are closed to new business. If not otherwise exempted from the requirements of the Affordable Care Act, the policies are grandfathered under the Affordable Care Act and not subject to the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. A limited number of these policies were guaranteed issued, although the majority of the policies were issued with individual underwriting.
Customers
CIG's long-term care insurance policies were marketed and sold to individuals between 1986 and 2010 for the purpose of providing defined levels of protection against the significant and escalating costs of long-term care services provided in the insured’s home or in assisted living or nursing facilities. Though CIG no longer actively markets new insurance products, it continues to service and receive net renewal premiums on its in-force Long-Term Care, Life, Annuity, and Other Accident & Health blocks for approximately 124,000 lives. 
Employees and Operations
As of December 31, 2020, CIG employed 144 people, the majority of whom are employed on a salaried basis with some on an hourly basis. Besides eleven remote employees working in various states, all other employees typically work out of the home office located in Austin, Texas. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most employees are working remotely with the exception of certain essential workers remaining in the home office. CIG considers its relations with its employees to be satisfactory and has never experienced a work stoppage or other labor disturbance. All operating centers maintain a cost effective and efficient operating model.
Administrative Services Agreement 
On December 24, 2015, an Administrative Services Agreement (the "Administrative Services Agreement") was entered into with Great American, pursuant to which Great American Life Insurance Company ("GALIC") agreed to continue to administer the Insurance Company’s life and annuity businesses for a period of no less than five years. Effective July 1, 2019, the Insurance Company and GALIC entered into Amendment No. 1 to Administrative Services Agreement which removed the five-year duration clause effectively extending the duration of the Administrative Services Agreement.
The KIC acquisition included the assumption of numerous existing, or the establishment of new, third party administrator ("TPA") agreements to continue to provide services and perform processes critical (actuarial, claims processing, rate increase work etc.) to KIC’s ability to continue producing outputs. The majority of KIC’s insurance contracts are currently administered by these TPAs. CIG has assumed the administration for the KIC Life and Annuity blocks previously administered by one of these TPAs.
Reinsurance
CIG reinsures through cession agreements a significant portion of its insurance business with unaffiliated reinsurers. In a reinsurance transaction, a reinsurer agrees to indemnify another insurer for part or all of its liability under a policy or policies it has issued for an agreed upon premium. CIG participates in reinsurance cession activities in order to minimize exposure to significant risks, limit losses, and provide additional capacity for future growth. CIG also obtains reinsurance to meet certain capital requirements.
Under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, the reinsurer agrees to reimburse CIG for the ceded amount in the event a claim is paid. Cessions under reinsurance agreements do not discharge CIG's obligations as the primary insurer. If the assuming reinsurer in a reinsurance agreement is unable to meet its obligations, CIG remains contingently liable. In the event that reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the terms of the reinsurance agreement, reinsurance recoverable balances could become uncollectible. CIG evaluates the financial condition of reinsurers to whom CIG cedes business and monitors concentration of credit risk to minimize our exposure. CIG may also require acceptable collateral to support reinsurance recoverable balances. The collectability of CIG’s reinsurance recoverable is primarily a function of the solvency of the individual reinsurers. Although CIG has controls to minimize its exposure, the insolvency of a reinsurer or the inability or unwillingness of a reinsurer to comply with the terms of a reinsurance contract could have a material adverse effect on CIG’s results of operations. CIG has various quota share reinsurance agreements in place for its long-term care business, with ceded reinsurance totaling $524 million in active life reserves and $125 million in disabled life reserves. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the gross liability associated with the reinsured policy.
Reserves for Policy Contracts and Benefits
The applicable insurance laws under which insurance companies operate require that they report, as liabilities, policy reserves to meet future obligations on their outstanding policies. These reserves are the amounts which, with the additional premiums to be received and interest thereon compounded annually at certain assumed rates, are calculated to be sufficient to meet the various policy and contract obligations as they mature. These laws specify that the reserves shall not be less than reserves calculated using certain specified mortality and morbidity tables, interest rates, and methods of valuation required for statutory accounting.
CIG calculates reserves in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"), which calculations can differ from those specified by the laws of the various states and reported in the statutory financial statements. These differences result from the use of mortality and morbidity tables and interest assumptions which CIG believes are more representative of the expected experience for these policies than those required for statutory accounting purposes and also result from differences in actuarial reserving methods.
The assumptions CIG uses to calculate its reserves are intended to represent an estimate of experience for the period that policy benefits are payable. If actual experience is more favorable than our reserve assumptions, then reserves should be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses. If experience is less favorable than the reserve assumptions, additional reserves may be required. The key experience assumptions include claim incidence rates, claim resolution rates, mortality and morbidity rates, policy persistency, interest rates, crediting spreads, and premium rate increases. CIG periodically reviews its experience and updates its policy reserves and reserves for all claims incurred, as it believes appropriate.
The statements of income include the annual change in reserves for future policy and contract benefits. The change reflects a normal accretion for premium payments and interest buildup and decreases for policy terminations such as lapses, deaths, and benefit payments. If policy reserves using best estimate assumptions as of the date of a test for loss recognition are higher than existing policy reserves net of any deferred acquisition costs, the increase in reserves necessary to recognize the deficiency is also included in the change in reserves for future policy and contract benefits.
For further discussion of reserves, refer to the risks related to the Insurance Segment within "Risk Factors" contained herein in Item 1A, the discussion of the Insurance segment operating results included in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contained herein in Item 7, and Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 13. Life, Accident and Health Reserves of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."
Investments
CIG manages its cash and invested assets using an approach that is intended to balance quality, diversification, asset/liability matching, liquidity needs and investment return. The goals of the investment process are to optimize after-tax, risk-adjusted investment income and after-tax, risk-adjusted total return while managing the assets and liabilities on a cash flow and duration basis. CIG’s liabilities are primarily supported by investments in investment grade, fixed maturity securities reflected on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
The Company filed an Investment Management Agreement Form D application with the Texas Department of Insurance ("TDOI") to appoint CIG, an affiliate, as investment manager, effective April 1, 2020. The TDOI issued a “no action” letter dated May 14, 2020 with respect to the April 1, 2020 Investment Management Agreement. The CGIC Board of Directors has approved the extension of the current IMA for a six month period and notification has been given to the TDOI on February 26, 2021. The TDOI responded on March 1, 2021 expressing no concern with the extension request.
CIG entered into a new Investment Management Agreement with Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. (“GSAM”) dated December 23, 2020 to begin providing services no earlier than January 1, 2021. Approximately one-third of the portfolio will be managed by GSAM while the remaining two-thirds remains with the affiliate investment manager, CIG.
Regulation
CIG's insurance company subsidiary is subject to regulations in the jurisdictions where it does business. In general, the insurance laws of the various states establish regulatory agencies with broad administrative powers governing, among other things, premium rates, solvency standards, licensing of insurers, agents and brokers, trade practices, forms of policies, maintenance of specified reserves and capital for the protection of policyholders, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, investment activities and relationships between insurance subsidiaries and their parents and affiliates. Material transactions between insurance subsidiaries and their parents and affiliates generally must receive prior approval of the applicable insurance regulatory authorities and be disclosed. In addition, while differing from state to state, these regulations typically restrict the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid by an insurer to its stockholders in any twelve-month period without advance regulatory approval. Such limitations are generally based on net earnings or statutory surplus.
Our insurance subsidiary is examined periodically by its state of domicile and by other states in which it is licensed to conduct business. The domestic examinations have traditionally emphasized financial matters from the perspective of protection of policyholders, but they can and have covered other subjects that an examining state may be interested in reviewing, such as market conduct issues. Examinations in other states more typically focus on market conduct, such as a review of sales practices, including the content and use of advertising materials and the licensing and appointing of agents and brokers, as well as underwriting, claims, and customer service practices, and identification and handling of unclaimed property to determine compliance with state laws. Our insurance subsidiary is also subject to assessments by state insurance guaranty associations to cover the proportional cost of insolvent or failed insurers. Financial impact of annual guaranty assessments for CGI has not been material.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), among other things, established a Federal Insurance Office ("FIO") within the U.S. Treasury. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the promulgation of regulations for the FIO to carry out its mandate to focus on systemic risk oversight. The FIO gathered information regarding the insurance industry and submitted a report to Congress in December 2013. The report concluded that a hybrid approach to regulation, involving a combination of state and federal government action, could improve the U.S. insurance system by attaining uniformity, efficiency and consistency, particularly with respect to solvency and market conduct regulation. The FIO has issued additional reports since that time on various aspects of the insurance sector and insurance regulation. We cannot predict the extent to which any of these matters might result in changes to the current state-based system of insurance industry regulation or ultimately impact the Company’s operations.
Risk-based capital ("RBC') standards for U.S. life insurance companies are prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC"). The domiciliary state of our insurance subsidiary has adopted a version of the NAIC RBC for Insurers Model Act, which prescribes a system for assessing the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus for all life and health insurers. The basis of the system is a risk-based formula that applies prescribed factors to the various risk elements in a life and health insurer's business to report a minimum capital requirement proportional to the amount of risk assumed by the insurer. The life and health RBC formula is designed to measure annually (i) the risk of loss from asset defaults and asset value fluctuations, (ii) the risk of loss from adverse mortality and morbidity experience, (iii) the risk of loss from mismatching of asset and liability cash flow due to changing interest rates, and (iv) business risks. The formula is used as an early warning tool to identify companies that are potentially inadequately capitalized. The formula is intended to be used as a regulatory tool only and is not intended as a means to rank insurers generally. The RBC ratio for our insurance subsidiary remains in line with our expectations and is significantly above the level that would require state regulatory action. The NAIC has also issued a proposal to implement a new and more granular RBC structure for fixed income asset capital charges. The proposed structure will expand the fixed income asset designations from six to 20 categories and will revise factor values. The new structure related to fixed income assets is not in effect as of December 31, 2020. CIG will continue to monitor the NAIC's activities on this issue.
Competition
CIG competes with financial services firms with respect to the acquisition of insurance companies and/or blocks of insurance businesses through merger, stock purchase, or reinsurance transactions or otherwise.
Environmental Regulation and Laws
Our operations and properties, including those of DBMG, are subject to a wide variety of increasingly complex and stringent foreign, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those concerning emissions into the air, discharge into waterways, generation, storage, handling, treatment and disposal of waste materials and health and safety of employees. Sanctions for noncompliance may include revocation of permits, corrective action orders, administrative or civil penalties and criminal prosecution. Some environmental laws provide for strict, joint and several liability for remediation of spills and other releases of hazardous substances, as well as damage to natural resources. In addition, companies may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances. These laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others, or for our acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed.
Compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or relating to the protection of the environment has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Based on our experience to date, we do not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on our business or consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as a result of future compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations. However, future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations or their interpretation, more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies, or stricter or different interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may require additional expenditures by us, which may be material. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant environmental compliance costs in the future.
