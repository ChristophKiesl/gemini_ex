Item 1: Business
Overview
Sonos is one of the world's leading sound experience brands. As the inventor of multi-room wireless audio products, Sonos' innovation helps the world listen better by giving people access to the content they love and allowing them to control it however they choose. Known for delivering an unparalleled sound experience, thoughtful design aesthetic, simplicity of use and an open platform, Sonos makes a breadth of audio content available to anyone.
Our sound system provides an immersive listening experience created by our thoughtfully designed speakers and components, our proprietary software platform and the ability to wirelessly stream the content our customers love from the services they prefer. We manage the complexity of delivering a seamless customer experience in a multi-user and open-platform environment. The Sonos sound system is easy to set up, use, and expand to bring audio to any room in the home. Through our software platform, we frequently enhance features and services on our products, improving functionality and customer experience.
Sonos sits at the intersection of emerging consumer technology and entertainment trends. The proliferation of streaming services and the rapid adoption of voice assistants are significantly changing audio consumption habits and how consumers interact with the internet. As a leading sound system for consumers, content partners and developers, Sonos is capitalizing on the large market opportunity created by these dynamics. Our network of partners provides our customers with access to voice control, streaming music, internet radio, podcasts and audiobook content, enabling them to control and listen to an expansive range of audio entertainment. Our platform has attracted a broad range of approximately 100 streaming content providers, such as Apple Music, Pandora, Spotify, and TuneIn. These partners find value in our independent platform and access to our millions of desirable and engaged customers.
We debuted the world’s first multi-room wireless sound system in 2005 and have since been a leading innovator in wireless home audio. Today, our products include wireless, portable, and home theater speakers, components, and accessories to address consumers’ evolving audio needs. In addition, we frequently introduce new services and features across our platform, providing our customers with enhanced functionality, improved sound, and an enriched user experience. 
We are committed to continuous technological innovation as evidenced by our growing global patent portfolio. We believe our patents comprise the foundational intellectual property for wireless multi-room and other audio technologies. 
As of October 2, 2021, we had a total of nearly 37.1 million products registered in approximately 12.6 million households globally, including the addition of approximately 1.7 million new households during fiscal 2021. Our customers have typically purchased additional Sonos products over time. As of October 2, 2021, 60% of our 12.6 million households had registered more than one Sonos product. As of October 2, 2021, our households own 3.0 products on average. We also estimate that our customers listened to 12.1 billion hours, excluding Bluetooth listening, of audio content using our products in fiscal 2021, which represents 19.0% growth from fiscal 2020.
Our innovative products, seamless customer experience, and expanding global footprint have driven 16 consecutive years of sustained revenue growth since our first product launch. We generate revenue from the sale of our Sonos speaker products, including wireless speakers and home theater speakers, from our Sonos system products, which largely comprises our component products, and from partner products and other revenue, including partnerships with IKEA and Sonance, Sonos and third-party accessories, licensing, advertising, and subscription revenue. 
Our growth is driven by both new customers buying our products as well as existing customers continuing to add products to their Sonos systems. In fiscal 2021, existing customers accounted for approximately 46% of new product registrations. We sell our products primarily through over 10,000 third-party physical retail stores, including custom installers of home audio systems. We also sell through select e-commerce retailers and our website sonos.com. Our products are distributed in over 50 countries, with 48.1% of our revenue in fiscal 2021 generated outside the United States.

Our Software 
Our proprietary software is the foundation of the Sonos sound system and further differentiates our products and services from those of our competitors. 
In June 2020, we introduced Sonos S2, a powerful new app and operating system to enable a new generation of Sonos products and experiences, which includes new features, usability updates, and more personalization while also enabling higher resolution audio technologies for music and home theater.
Our software provides the following key benefits: 
•Multi-room experience. Our system enables our speakers to work individually or together in synchronized playback groups, powered by wireless network and Bluetooth capabilities to route and play audio optimally.
•Open platform for content partners. Our platform enables customers to easily search and browse for content from a list of more than 100 content partners from around the world including stations, artists, albums, podcasts, audio books, and more. Content partners can connect to Sonos via our platform and find a new and growing audience for their catalogs.
•Intuitive and flexible control. Our customers can control their experiences through the Sonos app, voice control, from Sonos devices directly, or an expanding number of third-party apps and smart devices. As our customers navigate across different controllers, our technology synchronizes the control experience across the Sonos platform to deliver the music and entertainment experience they desire.
•Smart audio. We have made significant investments in our engineering team and audio technology. For example, we invented technology to allow two or more of our speakers to pair wirelessly and create multi-channel sound, thereby enabling a much broader sound field. In addition, our Trueplay technology utilizes the microphones on an iOS device to analyze room attributes, speaker placement and other acoustic factors in order to improve sound quality. We also developed Automatic TruePlay to deliver the same audio tuning experience, directly using the microphones integrated to our speakers and make this available to iOS and Android users.
•Continuous Improvement. Our software platform and cloud service enables feature enhancements and delivery of new experiences on an ongoing basis, so the Sonos experience improves for customers over time.
Our Partner Ecosystem
We have built a platform that attracts partners to enable our customers to play content from their preferred services. Our partners span across content, control, and third-party applications: 
•Content. We partner with a broad range of content providers, such as streaming music services, internet radio stations, and podcast services, allowing our customers to enjoy their audio content from whichever source they desire. 
•Control. We provide our customers with multiple options to control their home audio experiences, including voice control and direct control from within selected streaming music service apps. Our voice-enabled speaker products have Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant functionality, making our platform the first to offer consumers the ability to buy a single smart speaker with more than one voice assistant choice.
•Third-party partnerships. We partner with third-party developers to build new applications and services on top of the Sonos platform, increasing customer engagement and creating new experiences for our customers, such as architectural in-ceiling, in-wall and outdoor speakers in partnership with Sonance, as well as picture frames, bookshelf speaker and table lamp speaker in partnership with IKEA, and automotive sound partnership with Audi. 
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following combination of capabilities and features of our business model distinguish us from our competitors and position us well to capitalize on our opportunities:
•Leading sound system. We have developed and refined our sound system over the last 18 years. Our effort has resulted in significant consumer awareness and market share among home audio professionals. For example, a 2021 product study by CE Pro ranked Sonos as the leading brand in the wireless speakers, soundbar, and subwoofer categories. Our 92% share in the wireless speakers category among these industry professionals significantly outpaces our competitors.
•Proprietary Sonos app and software platform. We offer our customers a mobile app that controls the Sonos sound system and the entire listening experience. Customers can stream different audio content to speakers in different rooms or the same audio content synchronized throughout the entire home. Additionally, the Sonos app enables universal search, the ability to search for audio content across streaming services and owned content to easily find, play or curate music.
•Platform enables freedom of choice for consumers. Our broad and growing network of partners provides our customers with access to voice control, streaming music, internet radio, podcasts and audiobook content, enabling them to listen to the content they love from the services they prefer. Our platform attracts a broad set of content providers, including leading streaming music services and third-party developers.
•Differentiated consumer experience creates engaged households who often repeat purchases. We deliver a differentiated customer experience to millions of households every day, cultivating a passionate and engaged customer base. Long-term engagement with our products and our ability to continuously improve the functionality of our existing products through software updates leads to attractive economics as customers add products to their Sonos sound systems. We generate significant revenue and profits from customers purchasing additional products to expand their Sonos sound systems. Existing households represented approximately 46% of new product registrations in fiscal 2021. We have proven our ability to profitably add new homes, and develop new experiences that drive existing customers to add additional products to their home. We believe that we have yet to fully realize the lifetime value of our customer base. We believe this aspect of our financial model will continue to contribute to our ability to achieve sustainable, profitable growth over the long term.
•Commitment to innovation drives continuous improvement. We have made significant investments in research and development since our inception and believe that we own the foundational intellectual property of wireless multi-room and other audio technologies. We have significantly expanded the size of our patent portfolio in recent years. In 2019, the strength of our patent portfolio placed us 3rd in Electronics in the 1790 Analytics Patent Scorecards study.
Our Growth Strategies
Key elements of our growth strategy include:
•Continued introduction of innovative products and services and expansion into new categories. To address our market opportunity, we have developed a long-term roadmap to deliver innovative products, services and software enhancements, and expand into new categories. We intend to continue to introduce products and services across multiple categories designed for enjoyment in all the places and spaces that our customers listen to audio content, including outside of the home, as well as business and enterprise customers. Executing on our roadmap will position us to acquire new customers, increase sales to existing customers, and improve the customer experience. 
•Expansion of direct-to-consumer efforts and building relationships with existing channel partners and prospective customers. We are focused on reaching and converting prospective customers through third-party retail stores, e-commerce retailers, custom installers of home audio systems, and our website sonos.com. We expect that our direct-to-consumer channel will continue to contribute to our growth. We intend to continue to build direct relationships with current and prospective customers through sonos.com and the Sonos app to drive direct sales. In fiscal 2021, we generated 24.2% of total revenue through our direct-to-consumer channel, primarily sonos.com. While we seek to increase sales through our direct-to-consumer sales channel, we expect that our third-party retailers will continue to be an important part of our ecosystem. We will continue to seek retail partners that can deliver differentiated in-store experiences to support customer demand for product demonstrations. Additionally, we intend to expand and strengthen our partnerships with custom installers who are valuable to our customer base and contribute to our new household growth. For example, a 2021 product survey by CE Pro ranked Sonos as the leading brand in the wireless speakers, soundbar, and subwoofer categories. Our 92% share in the wireless speakers among these industry professionals significantly outpaces our competitors. 
•Expand partner ecosystem to enhance platform. We intend to deepen our relationships with our current partners and expand our partner ecosystem by providing our customers access to streaming music services, voice assistants, internet radio, podcasts and audiobook content. 
•Increase brand awareness in existing geographic markets. We intend to increase our household penetration rates in our existing geographic markets by increasing brand awareness, expanding our product offerings and growing our partner ecosystem. 
•Expansion into new geographic markets. Geographic expansion represents a growth opportunity in currently underserved countries. We intend to expand into new countries over time by employing country-specific marketing campaigns and distribution channels.
Research and Development
Our research and development team develops new software and hardware products and services, as well as improves and enhances our existing software and hardware products to address customer demands and emerging trends. Our team has worked on features and enhancements to the Sonos system including development and improvements to the Sonos app, product setup, Trueplay tuning, and the ability to use Alexa or Google voice services. Our audio team has developed a series of acoustic technologies which enabled us to create speakers that produce high-fidelity sound. Our wireless and radio team established world-class wireless performance that enabled multi-room experience, wireless surround sound, and many more applications. Our industrial design and mechanical engineering teams developed a cohesive, unique family of products across multiple categories and use-cases such as home theater, all-in-one, and portable. These products demonstrate a range of proprietary manufacturing and design details, logo application techniques, and assembly architecture. The products and software we develop require significant technological knowledge and expertise to develop at a competitive pace. We believe our research and development capabilities and our intellectual property differentiates us from our competitors. We intend to continue to significantly invest in research and development to bring new products and software to market and expand our platform and capabilities. 
Sales and Marketing
We sell our products primarily through over 10,000 third-party physical retail stores, including custom installers of home audio systems, and our products are distributed in more than 50 countries. The majority of our sales are transacted through traditional physical retailers, including on their websites. We also sell through online retailers, to custom installers who bundle our products with services that they sell to their customers, and directly through our website sonos.com. We sell products internationally through distributors and through retailers. 
We invest in customer experience and customer relationship management to drive loyalty, word-of-mouth marketing and growth of our direct channels. Our marketing investments are focused on driving profitable growth through advertising, public relations and brand promotion activities, including digital, sponsorships, brand activations and collaborations, and channel marketing. We intend to continue to invest significant resources in our marketing and brand development efforts, including investing in capital expenditures on product displays to support our retail channel partners.
Manufacturing, Logistics and Fulfillment
We outsource the manufacturing of our speakers and components to contract manufacturers, using our design specifications. Our products are manufactured by contract manufacturers in China and during fiscal 2020, we began to diversify our supply chain through the addition of contract manufacturing in Malaysia. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected our supply chain consistent with its effect across many industries, including creating shipping and logistics challenges, and placing significant limits on component supplies. The pandemic has also delayed our efforts to fully diversify our supply chain into Malaysia until fiscal 2022. 
Our contracts with our contract manufacturers do not obligate them to supply products to us in any specific quantity, except as specified in our purchase orders that are aligned with forecasts based on terms and conditions of the contract. The vast majority of our products are shipped to our third-party warehouses which we then ship to our distributors, retailers and directly to our customers. Our third-party warehouses are located in the United States in California and Pennsylvania, as well as internationally in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, China, Japan, and the United Kingdom.
We use a small number of logistics providers for substantially all of our product delivery to both distributors and retailers. This approach generally allows us to reduce order fulfillment time, reduce shipping costs and improve inventory flexibility.
Competition
We compete against established, audio-focused sellers of speakers and sound systems such as Bang & Olufsen, Bose, Samsung (and its subsidiaries Harman International and JBL), Sony and Sound United (and its subsidiaries Denon and Polk), and against developers of voice-enabled speakers and other voice-enabled products such as Amazon, Apple and Google. In some cases, our competitors are also our partners in our product development and resale and distribution channels. Many of our competitors have significant market share, diversified product lines, well-established supply and distribution systems, strong worldwide brand recognition, loyal customer bases and significant financial, marketing, research, development and other resources.
The principal competitive factors in our market include:
•brand awareness and reputation;
•breadth of product offering;
•price;
•sound quality;
•multi-room and wireless capabilities;
•customer support;
•product quality and design;
•ease of setup and use; and
•network of technology and content partners.
We believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of the factors described above.
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property is an important aspect of our business, and we seek protection for our intellectual property as appropriate. To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely upon a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws and contractual restrictions such as confidentiality agreements, licenses and intellectual property assignment agreements. We maintain a policy requiring our employees, contractors, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements to control access to our proprietary information. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection, and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. There is no guarantee that we will prevail on any patent infringement claims against third parties. Furthermore, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we therefore may be unable to protect our proprietary technology in certain jurisdictions.
Sonos is a leading innovator that holds a comprehensive portfolio of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various other countries. Sonos’ patent portfolio, in particular, has been recognized as one of the strongest in consumer electronics. Our patents and patent applications relate to hardware, software, networking, accessories, and services, and include technology for the ability to stream content for playback wirelessly to one or more rooms in the home or business. It also includes technology for enabling a wide range of experiences and audio technologies that are important to the Sonos platform and enjoyed by millions of people every day across the globe. Experiences covered by our patents include simple system setup, seamless integration with other platforms and services, balanced sound, voice interactions and control, as well as experiences unique to home theater to name a few. We regularly file patent applications in the U.S. and throughout the world to protect our innovations and technology that come from areas such as research, development, and design. Our patents expire at various times and no single patent or other intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting Sonos’ products and services. Sonos continues to invest in protecting its expanding innovation through ongoing development of its patent portfolio. In addition to its own intellectual property, Sonos also enters into licensing agreements with our third-party partners to provide access to a broad range of technology, services, and content for our customers.
In January 2020, we filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission ("ITC") against Alphabet Inc. ("Alphabet") and Google LLC ("Google") and a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California against Google. The complaint and lawsuit each allege infringement of certain Sonos patents related to its smart speakers and related technology. In September 2020, we filed a lawsuit against Google in the U.S. District Court for Western District of Texas, alleging infringement of five Sonos wireless audio patents, which lawsuit has been subsequently transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. In December 2020, we filed a lawsuit against Google Germany Gmbh and Google Ireland Ltd. in the regional court of Hamburg, Germany, alleging infringement of a Sonos patent related to control of playback of media by mobile and playback devices. Google has responded by filing a patent infringement lawsuit and a declaratory judgement of non-infringement against us during fiscal 2020 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and in Canada, Germany, France and the Netherlands, and patent infringement lawsuits against our subsidiary Sonos Europe B.V. in Germany, France and the Netherlands. See Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.
While we believe that our active patents and patent applications are an important aspect of our business, we also rely heavily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of our personnel.
Human Capital
Sonos is dedicated to creating the ultimate listening experience for our customers, and our employees are critical to achieving this mission. In order to continue to design innovative experiences and products, and compete and succeed in our highly competitive and rapidly evolving market, it is crucial that we continue to attract and retain experienced employees. As part of these efforts, we strive to offer a competitive compensation and benefits program, foster a community where everyone feels included and empowered to do their best work, and give employees the opportunity to give back to their communities and make a social impact.
As of October 2, 2021, we had 1,525 full-time employees. Of our full-time employees, 1,075 were in the United States and 450 were in our international locations. Other than our employees in France and the Netherlands, none of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 
Compensation and Benefits Program. Our compensation program is designed to attract and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business objectives, assist in the achievement of our strategic goals and create long-term value for our stockholders. We provide employees with compensation packages that include base salary, annual incentive bonuses, and long-term equity awards ("RSUs") tied to the value of our stock price. We believe that a compensation program with both short-term and long-term awards provides fair and competitive compensation and aligns employee and stockholder interests, including by incentivizing business and individual performance (pay for performance), motivating based on long-term company performance and integrating compensation with our business plans. In addition to cash and equity compensation, we also offer employees benefits such as life and health (medical, dental & vision) insurance, paid time off, paid parental leave, and a 401(k) plan. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. At Sonos, we believe that music and sound is universal and connects us as people, and we strive to build products that move everyone. To do this, we are committed to building an equitable and inclusive environment where diverse teams build more creative solutions, drive better results, innovate and bring their authentic selves to work each day. We monitor the representation of women and racially or ethnically diverse team members at different levels throughout the company and disclose the composition of our team in our annual Listen Better Report, which is our corporate social responsibility report available on the Investor Relations section of our website.
In fiscal 2020, we set a goal of 50% of new U.S. hires coming from underrepresented groups. In fiscal 2021, we made progress towards this goal, with 44% of new U.S. hires from underrepresented groups. As an organization, we’ve committed to annual diversity, equity and inclusion goals to increase representation at all levels and foster greater connection and belonging at Sonos. To accomplish these goals, we’re implementing initiatives to help us reach these goals, including:
•examining our hiring practices to ensure we source the best talent from the widest available pool;
•intentional listening to our employee resource groups who provide critical insight into the experience of underrepresented groups at Sonos and across our industry;
•frequent review of our policies and practices to ensure an equitable experience for all;
•coupling our hiring goals with a focus on retention, employee engagement, and inclusive leadership;
•implementing mentoring and allyship programs that connect employees to key support systems across Sonos; and
•deepening our organizational acumen around allyship, unconscious bias, and equity.
Community Involvement. We aim to give back to the communities where we live and work, and believe that this commitment helps in our efforts to attract and retain employees. We offer employees the opportunity to give back both through our Sonos Soundwaves program, which partners with leading non-profits, and our Sonos Cares program, which offers employees paid volunteer time each year.
