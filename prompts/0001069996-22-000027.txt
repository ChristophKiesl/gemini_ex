GOING CONCERN
The Company has recently concluded that there is substantial doubt regarding its ability to continue as a going concern under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Our assessment of our ability to continue as a going concern was dependent on many factors, including, among other things, whether we would be able to maintain a Demotech rating of “A” for FNIC and MNIC, the impact such a downgrade might have on our ability to obtain excess-of-loss reinsurance for the period beginning July 1, 2022, and the continued impact severe weather events in 2022 will have on our RBC ratio and statutory surplus. 
The Company reached this conclusion based on its expectation of continued underwriting losses in the first quarter of 2022, primarily as a result of new catastrophe weather events occurring late in the first quarter and, more importantly, based on Demotech’s downgrade of FNIC’s rating from “A” to “S”. MNIC’s “A” rating was recently reaffirmed. The Company believes that the downgrade of FNIC’s Demotech rating will adversely impact our ability to obtain excess-of-loss reinsurance for coverage beginning July 1, 2022. Absent such coverage, the Company will not be in compliance with requirements communicated by the Office of Insurance Regulation of the state of Florida (“OIR”) regarding such coverage, which could ultimately result in the Company being placed into receivership. Further, the Company’s conclusion that there is substantial doubt with respect to its ability to continue as a going concern is expected to result in increased regulatory oversight of the Company’s operations by the OIR. On April 21, 2022, the Company entered into a consent order with the OIR under which the Company has agreed to file with the OIR by April 29, 2022 a plan to demonstrate the Company’s ability to secure and maintain a financial strength rating acceptable to the secondary mortgage market, acquire sufficient reinsurance as of its July 1, 2022 renewal, support its existing business via the securing of additional capital, and address its non-Florida losses and policies.
Being placed into receivership and/or failing to obtain excess-of-loss reinsurance each represent potential defaults under the applicable covenants of our senior note indentures that could result in acceleration of repayment of our debt. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to comply with certain covenants in our senior note indentures or to make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event we cannot do so. Please see Item 7 — “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further discussion. Also, for additional discussion of factors that may affect our ability to continue as a going concern and the potential consequences of our failure to do so, please see “Item 1A — Risk Factors.”
-- 


Accordingly, in the aggregate, such conditions raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company continues to explore strategic alternatives in an effort to increase its capital resources to support its insurance carriers and preserve value for the Company’s many stakeholders. These alternatives include raising additional capital and restructuring our insurance carriers (including potential reallocations of capital or books of business among our three carriers to safeguard portions of our existing business), as well as other reinsurance and capital options; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute on all or any of the strategic alternatives, successfully raise additional capital or obtain excess-of-loss reinsurance. Management’s action plans include the following, many of which are intended to improve profitability, some of which are already well underway:
•We have refocused our operations on writing Florida homeowners policies by, among other things, allowing our policies outside of Florida to run off. Our non-Florida policies have driven a disproportionately high percentage of catastrophe losses over the past two years. The runoff of our non-Florida business that began in December 2021 is currently expected to continue over a period of approximately 18 months, during which time policies would remain in effect until their expiration dates. We are also currently exploring options to accelerate this process. See Overview of Insurance Lines of Business – Non-Florida for more information about the status of the runoff of our non-Florida books.
•We are writing fewer policies to adjust to our lower level of capital.
•We are exploring restructuring alternatives for our insurance carriers to increase our ability to obtain an excess-of-loss reinsurance tower for our Florida book of business.
•We are exploring alternative terms and conditions to enhance our attractiveness to potential excess-of-loss reinsurance partners.
•We have applied for rate increases with an estimated 12.9% increase of our rates on our existing and new business in Florida, and will continue new rate filings as needed to keep up with our substantially increased costs of doing business.
•We may merge one or more of our insurance carriers, subject to regulatory approvals, to the extent that such action would drive capital and/or RBC efficiencies.
•We are seeking additional capital through various means, including the potential issuance of equity and/or debt securities (consistent with our existing debt indentures) and possible sales of non-core assets. 
In assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, the Company did not assume the successful execution of such strategies and action plans because they are not fully within the Company’s control.
INSURANCE OPERATIONS AND RELATED SERVICES
Business Strategy
To address the challenges facing the Company as discussed above, the Company is continuing numerous operational initiatives to improve our underwriting results, as follows:
•refocusing on writing policies in Florida, where the market has improved over the last few years due to legislative reform and significant rate increases implemented by FNIC and MNIC;
•executing an orderly runoff of insurance policies in our non-Florida markets, including all insurance operations of MIC and FNIC’s non-Florida book written through SageSure, a third-party managing general underwriter;
•increasing rates on our policies, where warranted, based on claims experience and the increased cost of catastrophe and quota-share reinsurance, with a focus on generating an overall sustainable underwriting profit, irrespective of competitive pricing pressures within the markets where we operate, in all cases subject to required regulatory approvals;
•continuing to non-renew, within all relevant regulatory parameters, policies that no longer meet our underwriting and/or profitability standards as we continuously update our view of risk based on emerging trends and information; 
•applying rigorous underwriting standards on all new and renewal business, even if that limits growth in our Florida book of business, due to the challenging claims environment;
•focusing on operational efficiencies to reduce expenses in conjunction with our continued investment in, and use of, technology;
•enhancing our property analytical metrics on our property books of business, such as construction type, year built and age of roof, while managing our underwriting appetite, whether new or renewal, in pursuit of a better quality book of business;
•maintaining our commitment to provide high quality customer service to our agents and insureds;
•continued focus of our marketing efforts by retaining key personnel and utilizing multiple distribution strategies;
•offering competitive compensation to our agents to place quality business with our companies;
•continuing with our comprehensive catastrophe reinsurance programs to reduce our exposure to risks;
-- 


•continuing our execution of the strategic review process initiated by our board of directors, as announced on November 4, 2020, which could result in, among other things, changes in our strategy or operations, a strategic business combination or other possible transactions, possible joint ventures or dispositions of assets, or continuing to execute on our current business plan; and
•optimizing the free cash flow generated by our managing general agencies and other insurance services businesses.

Overview of Insurance Lines of Business
Homeowners Property and Casualty Insurance
FNIC, MIC and MNIC underwrite homeowners insurance in Florida and FNIC and MIC also underwrites homeowners insurance in Louisiana and Texas, while FNIC also underwrites homeowners in South Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi. Homeowners insurance generally protects an owner of real and personal property against covered causes of loss to that property. As of December 31, 2021, the total homeowners policies in-force was 280,000, of which 160,000 were in Florida and 120,000 were outside of Florida. As of December 31, 2020, the total homeowners policies in-force was 361,000, of which 207,000 were in Florida and 154,000 were outside of Florida. Refer to Overview of Insurance Lines of Business - Non-Florida below for information regarding the Company's plan to execute an orderly runoff of our non-Florida insurance operations.
Florida
Our homeowners insurance products provide maximum dwelling coverage of approximately $3.6 million, with the aggregate maximum policy limit being approximately $6.3 million. We currently offer dwelling coverage “A” up to $4.0 million with an aggregate total insured value of $6.5 million. We continually review and update these limits. The approximate average premium on the policies currently in-force is $2,696, as compared with $2,100 for 2020. The typical deductible is either $2,500 or $1,000 for non-hurricane-related claims and generally 2% of the coverage amount for the structure for hurricane-related claims.
Premium rates charged to our homeowners insurance policyholders are continually evaluated to assure that they meet the expectation that they are actuarially sound and produce a reasonable level of profit (neither excessive, inadequate or discriminatory). Premium rates in Florida and other states are regulated and approved by the respective states’ office of insurance regulation. We continuously monitor and seek appropriate adjustment to our rates in order to remain competitive and profitable.
Through MIC, we have assumed Florida policies through the state-run insurer Citizens Property Insurance Corporation ("Citizens").
The following are our recent approved rate actions that we have taken across our three insurance subsidiaries:
•In 2020, FNIC received approval from the OIR for a statewide-average rate increase of 6.7% for Florida homeowners multiple-peril insurance policies, which became effective for new policies on February 8, 2021 and for renewal policies on March 30, 2021.
•In 2020, FNIC received OIR approval for a statewide-average rate increase of 8.3% for Florida dwelling fire insurance policies, which became effective for new policies on February 2, 2021 and for renewal policies on March 30, 2021.
•In 2020, MIC received OIR approval for a statewide-average rate increase of 15.0% for Florida manufactured home insurance policies, which became effective for new policies on March 10, 2021.
•In 2021, FNIC received OIR approval for a statewide-average rate increase of 9.0% for Florida homeowners multiple-peril insurance policies, which became effective for new policies on March 1, 2021 and for renewal policies on April 15, 2021.
•In 2021, MIC received OIR approval for a statewide-average rate increase of 14.8% for Florida takeout wind only policies, which became effective on August 1, 2021.
•In 2021, MIC filed for a statewide-average rate increase of 14.9% for Florida manufactured home insurance policies, which became effective for new and renewal policies on August 15, 2021.
•In 2021, FNIC received approval from the OIR for a statewide-average rate increase of 0.9% for Florida homeowners multiple-peril insurance policies, which became effective for new policies on September 1, 2021 and for renewal policies on October 15, 2021.
•In 2021, MIC received OIR approval for a statewide-average rate increase of 14.9% for Florida takeout wind only policies, which became effective on December 25, 2021.
•In 2021, MIC received OIR approval for a statewide-average rate increase of 14.9% for Florida voluntary wind only policies, which became effective on February 7, 2022.

•Other rate filings have been filed with the OIR and are pending approval.
Non-Florida
Our FNIC non-Florida homeowners insurance products, produced through our partnership with SageSure, provide maximum dwelling coverage “A” up to $1.8 million, with the aggregate maximum policy limit being approximately $3.5 million. The approximate average premium on the policies currently in-force is $1,968, as compared with $1,761 for 2020. The typical deductible is either $2,500 or $1,000 for non-hurricane-related claims and generally 2% of the coverage amount for the structure for hurricane-related claims. 
As part of our partnership with SageSure, previously we entered into a profit share agreement, whereby we shared 50% of net profits of this line of business through June 30, 2020, as calculated per the terms of the agreement, subject to limitations, which included limits on the net losses that SageSure could realize. The profit share cost was reflected in commissions and other underwriting expenses on our consolidated statement of operations. Effective July 1, 2020, FNIC entered into a quota-share treaty with Anchor Re, Inc. ("Anchor Re"), an Arizona captive that is an affiliate of SageSure, the non-affiliated managing general underwriter that writes FNIC’s non-Florida homeowners business. The treaty provides 50% quota-share reinsurance protection on claims incurred subsequent to July 1, 2020 on in-force, new and renewal business through June 30, 2021, subject to certain limitations. The treaty was fully collateralized through Anchor Re. The financial economics of this treaty substantially mirrored the 50% profit-sharing arrangement that was previously in place. Thus, this treaty did not have any impact on the pre-tax operating results of the Company, though the components of the combined ratio were affected by the ceding of premiums, claims and commissions. 
On November 3, 2020, FNIC increased its cession percentage in this treaty from 50% to 80%, effective December 1, 2020, on claims incurred subsequent to December 1, 2020 on in-force, new and renewal basis. Effective January 31, 2021, the Company terminated its then-existing quota-share reinsurance treaty with Anchor Re and commuted the agreement. Immediately after the commutation, the Company entered into an 80% quota-share treaty with Anchor Re on February 1, 2021 on an in-force, new and renewal basis, which covered the thirteen month period through February 28, 2022, subject to certain limitations. The treaty arrangement was fully collateralized through Anchor Re.
Effective December 31, 2021, the Company terminated its existing 80% quota-share reinsurance treaty with Anchor Re and commuted the agreement. Immediately after the commutation, the Company entered into a 100% quota-share treaty with Anchor Re on December 31, 2021 on an in-force, new and renewal basis, which covers the six month period through June 30, 2022, subject to certain limitations which include limits on the net losses that Anchor Re can realize during the treaty year. The new treaty excludes catastrophe losses, involves a funded trust and is fully collateralized through Anchor Re.
Our MIC non-Florida insurance products include homeowners insurance, manufactured home insurance and dwelling fire insurance. MIC writes both full peril property policies as well as wind/hail only exposures.
The following are our recent approved rate actions that we have taken across our insurance subsidiaries that do business outside of Florida:
•In 2021, FNIC applied for a statewide-average rate increase of 8.4.% for Mississippi homeowners insurance policies, which was approved by the respective regulatory agency and became effective for new policies on January 17, 2022 and for renewal policies on March 1, 2022.
•In 2021, MIC applied for a statewide-average rate increase of 24.6% for Louisiana voluntary dwelling insurance policies, which was approved by the respective regulatory agency and became effect for new policies on March 15, 2021 and for renewal policies on April 15, 2021.
•In 2021, FNIC applied for a statewide-average rate increase of 5.0% for Alabama homeowners insurance policies, which was approved by the respective regulatory agency and became effective for new policies on April 1, 2021 and for renewal policies on May 1, 2021.
•In 2021, FNIC applied for a statewide-average rate increase of 6.9% for South Carolina homeowners insurance policies, which was approved by the respective regulatory agency and became effective for new policies on April 1, 2021 and for renewal policies on May 1, 2021.
•In 2021, FNIC applied for a statewide-average rate increase of 9.0% for Texas homeowners insurance policies, which was approved by the respective regulatory agency and became effective for new policies on April 8, 2021 and for renewal policies on May 1, 2021.
•In 2021, FNIC applied for a statewide-average rate increase of 9.5% for Texas homeowners insurance policies, which was approved by the respective regulatory agency and became effective for new policies on August 16, 2021 for renewal policies on November 1, 2021.
-- 


•In 2021, FNIC applied for a statewide-average rate increase of 15.0% for Texas homeowners insurance policies, which was approved by the respective regulatory agency and became effective for new policies on November 1, 2021 and for renewal policies on December 16, 2021.
•In 2021, MIC applied for a statewide-average rate increase of 11.1% for Louisiana homeowners insurance policies, which was approved by the respective regulatory agency and became effective for new policies on May 15, 2021 and for renewal policies on July 1, 2021.
•In 2021, MIC applied for a statewide-average rate increase of 11.0% for Louisiana takeout insurance policies, which was approved by the respective regulatory agency and became effective for new and renewal policies on July 1, 2021.
•In 2021, FNIC applied for a statewide-average rate increase of 11.0% for Louisiana homeowners insurance policies, which was approved by the respective regulatory agency and became effective for new and renewal policies on July 1, 2021. In 2021, MIC applied for a statewide-average rate increase of 25.7% for Texas voluntary wind only insurance policies, which was effective for new and renewal policies on July 15, 2021.
•In 2021, MIC applied for a statewide-average rate increase of 9.5% for Texas takeout wind only insurance policies, which was effective for new and renewal policies on July 15, 2021.
•In 2021, MIC applied for a statewide-average rate increase of 22.6% for Texas manufactured home insurance policies, which was effective for new and renewal policies on August 15, 2021.
•In 2021, FNIC applied for a statewide-average rate increase of 15.0% for Louisiana homeowners insurance policies, which was approved by the respective regulatory agency and became effective for new policies on October 25, 2021 and for renewal policies on December 1, 2021.
•In 2021, MIC applied for a statewide-average rate increase of 19.0% for Louisiana takeout insurance policies, which was approved by the respective regulatory agency and became effective for new and renewal policies on November 25, 2021.
•In 2021, MIC applied for a statewide-average rate increase of 8.6% for Louisiana manufactured home insurance policies, which was approved by the respective regulatory agency and became effective for new and renewal policies on November 25, 2021.
•In 2021, MIC applied for a statewide-average rate increase of 23.1% for Texas homeowners insurance policies, which was effective for new policies on December 1, 2021 and effective for renewal policies on January 1, 2022.
•In 2021, MIC applied for a statewide-average rate increase of 18.9% for Louisiana homeowners insurance policies, which was approved by the respective regulatory agency and became effective for new and renewal policies on December 3, 2021.
•In 2021, FNIC applied for a statewide-average rate increase of 20.0% for South Carolina homeowners insurance policies, which was approved by the respective regulatory agency and became effective for new policies on April 1, 2022 and for renewal policies on May 1, 2022.
•Additional rate filings have been applied for by FNIC and MIC and are pending to be approved by the respective regulatory agency.
In November 2021, the Company announced its plan to re-focus its operations on the Florida market, which has been the Company’s historical focus. In conjunction with this shift in strategy, the Company commenced an orderly runoff of MIC’s insurance operations. In that regard, MIC filed appropriate documentation with its insurance regulators in Louisiana, Florida and Texas concerning MIC’s withdrawal plan. We began non-renewing MIC’s Louisiana policies on their anniversary dates in January 2022. Non-renewal of MIC’s Texas policies began in March 2022, and the non-renewal of MIC’s Florida policies is expected to begin in July 2022. With respect to FNIC’s Texas and Louisiana books, the Company and SageSure (the third-party MGU that underwrote the business and owns the renewal rights thereof) began transferring policies onto alternative SageSure insurance carrier partners in December 2021, by virtue of making offers of coverage to FNIC policyholders. FNIC policies in South Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi are expected to continue to be renewed by FNIC up through June 30, 2022. SageSure has begun offering renewals in Texas and Louisiana from alternative SageSure insurance carrier partners and we expect they will do the same in South Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi by July 2022. We expect to begin non-renewing all FNIC's policies produced by SageSure in all states, subject to regulatory approvals of our withdrawal plans, beginning April 30, 2022 for Texas and Louisiana and beginning May 31, 2022 for Alabama and Mississippi, and June 30, 2022 in South Carolina. The non-renewal of all existing policies is governed by the appropriate regulatory requirements of each state in which the property insured by the policy is located. In conjunction with the 100% quota-share treaty and the in-process transfer of the book discussed above, effective February 1, 2022, claims handling for the SageSure book was transferred to an affiliate of SageSure.
Other Lines of Business
Flood:  FNIC writes flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program (“NFIP”). We write the policy for the NFIP, which assumes 100% of the flood risk while we retain a commission for our service. FNIC offers this line of business in Florida, 
-- 


Louisiana, Texas, Alabama, South Carolina and Mississippi. FNIC plans to file an admitted flood endorsement as an alternative to the NFIP program. Until December 2021, MIC wrote flood insurance through a partnership with Bintech Partners, Inc. who assumes 100% of the risk, in Louisiana only.
MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
Our independent agents and general agents have the authority to sell and bind insurance coverage in accordance with procedures established by FNU. FNU generally accepts all coverage that falls within stated underwriting criteria. For all policies issued, FNU has the right, within a period that varies by state between 60 days and 120 days from a policy’s inception, to cancel any policy, upon an advanced notice provided in accordance with statutory specific guidelines, even if the risk falls within our underwriting criteria. We are focusing our marketing efforts on Florida and are maintaining our commitment to long-term relationships. We market our products and services throughout Florida by establishing relationships with independent agents and general agents. As previously discussed, we are in the process of executing an orderly runoff of insurance policies in our non-Florida market.
We believe that our integrated computer systems, which allow for rapid automated premium quotation and policy issuance by our agents, are key elements in providing quality service to both our agents and insureds for our various lines of business.
LIABILITY FOR LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES
We are directly liable for loss and loss adjustment expense (“LAE”) payments under the terms of the insurance policies that are underwritten by our insurance companies. In many cases, there may be a time lag between the occurrence and reporting of an insured loss and our payment of that loss. As required by insurance regulations and accounting rules, we reflect the liability for the ultimate payment of all incurred losses and LAE by establishing a liability for those unpaid losses and LAE for both reported and unreported claims, which represent estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses.
When a claim involving a probable loss is reported, we establish a liability for the estimated amount of our ultimate loss and LAE payments. We based our estimate upon such factors as the type of loss, jurisdiction of the occurrence, knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim, severity of injury or damage, potential for ultimate exposure, estimate of liability on the part of the insured, past experience with similar claims and the applicable policy provisions.
We also establish a liability on an aggregate basis to provide for incurred but not reported (“IBNR”). The estimates of the liability for loss and LAE reserves are subject to the effect of trends in claims severity and frequency and are continually reviewed. As part of this process, we review historical data and consider various factors, including known and anticipated legal developments, inflation and economic conditions. As experience develops and other data becomes available, these estimates are revised, as required, resulting in an increase or decrease of the existing liability for loss and LAE reserves. Adjustments are reflected in results of operations in the period in which they are made and the liability may deviate substantially from prior estimates.
REINSURANCE
Reinsurance is used to mitigate the insurance loss exposure related to certain events such as natural and man-made catastrophes, manage overall capital adequacy and protect capital resources. We reinsure (cede) a portion of written premiums on an excess of loss or a quota-share basis in order to limit our loss exposure. To the extent that reinsuring companies are unable to meet their obligations assumed under these reinsurance agreements, we remain primarily liable to our policyholders. 
Reinsurance markets include:
•Traditional local and global reinsurance markets including those in the United States (“U.S.”), Bermuda, London and Europe, accessed directly and through reinsurance intermediaries;
•Capital markets through insurance-linked securities and collateralized reinsurance transactions, such as catastrophe bonds, sidecars and similar vehicles;
•Other insurers that engage in both direct and assumed reinsurance; and
•Other entities, including unrated reinsurance captives, to facilitate the sharing of the financial results of certain programs.
The form of reinsurance that we may choose from time to time will generally depend on whether we are seeking:
•Proportional reinsurance, whereby we cede a specified percentage of premium and losses to reinsurers;
•Non-proportional or excess of loss reinsurance, whereby we cede all or a specified portion of losses in excess of a specified amount on a per risk, per occurrence (including catastrophe reinsurance) or aggregate basis; or
-- 


•Facultative contracts that reinsure individual policies.
Significant Reinsurance Contracts
FNIC, MIC and MNIC operate primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct accounts on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those exceed the desired retention level. We continually evaluate the relative attractiveness of different forms of reinsurance contracts and different markets that may be used to achieve our risk and profitability objectives. Our reinsurance contracts do not relieve FNIC, MIC or MNIC from their direct obligations to the insured. 
Portions of our 2021-2022 program exclude coverage for severe convective storms after December 1, 2021. Those portions of the reinsurance program that exclude severe convective storms are specifically in the lowest layer of coverage (below approximately $30 million in each tower). As such, other than the potential coverage under certain quota-share reinsurance treaties, the Company will retain 100% of any severe convective storm losses that may occur in this layer. We may determine to purchase additional coverage for such storms, but the Company anticipates that the reinsurance market will remain hard such that additional coverage may not be available or may be on terms, including premiums, unfavorable to us.
While it is not always possible to reinsure every known and unknown risk to our company, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses. There is a credit risk exposure with respect to ceded losses to the extent that any reinsurer is unable or unwilling to meet the obligations assumed under the reinsurance contracts. The collectability of reinsurance is subject to the solvency of the reinsurers, interpretation of contract language and other factors. The availability and amount of ceded premiums and losses associated with the acquisition of reinsurance will vary year to year. Our reinsurance program is subject to approval primarily by the OIR and other regulators in states where we do business, and subject to review by Demotech, Inc. (“Demotech”). Demotech provides Financial Stability Ratings (“FSR”) for property and casualty insurance companies throughout the United States.
We are selective in choosing reinsurers and consider numerous factors, the most important of which are the financial stability of the reinsurer or capital specifically pledged to uphold the contract, its history of responding to claims and its overall reputation. In an effort to minimize our exposure to the insolvency of a reinsurer, we evaluate the acceptability and review the financial condition of the reinsurer at least annually with the assistance of our reinsurance broker. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had over 60 reinsurance companies on our program which are required to have at least an “A-” or better rating by A.M. Best Company (“A.M. Best”) or the agreement would need to be fully collateralized. In addition, FNIC has a quota-share reinsurance treaty on a collateralized basis with Anchor Re, which is an affiliate of SageSure that does not have an A.M. Best rating. Refer to Overview of Insurance Lines of Business - Non-Florida for information on this reinsurance treaty.
Refer to Note 6 of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report, for further information regarding our reinsurance programs.
EMPLOYEE, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL GOVERNANCE
Our mission is to be a leading provider of insurance by providing unparalleled service to customers, a compelling work environment for our employees, a fair return to our shareholders, and to operate the Company today with a vision of tomorrow. We believe that our behaviors, decisions and vision, including how we manage talent, shapes the future we share with our customers, communities and investors. We believe that business can only flourish in societies where human rights are protected and respected. We recognize that business has the responsibility to respect human rights and the ability to contribute to positive human rights impacts. This is an area of growing importance to our employees, workers, shareholders, investors, customers, consumers, the communities where we operate and civil society groups. There is therefore both a business and a moral case for ensuring that human rights are upheld across our operations. Our enterprise strategy is driven by continued focus on our core cultural values:
•Radiate Integrity - Maintain the highest order of ethical and legal conduct in all aspects of our business. There is no right way to do a wrong thing. 
•Embrace Responsibility - Own the outcomes of our results. Accept accountability and meet challenges with insightful perspective and collaborative solutions.

•Provide Stability - In an industry grounded in uncertainty, be a constant in every relationship. Dependability is essential to who we are.
Our Company is committed to the International Bill of Human Rights, which consists of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the principles concerning fundamental rights set out in the International Labor Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. It is the Company’s policy to respect the human rights of all individuals impacted by our operations, including employees and external stakeholders. While governments have the primary responsibility to protect against human rights violations, the Company recognizes its corporate responsibility to respect human rights. However, we do not tolerate violations committed by our employees, affiliates, or any third parties action on behalf or related in any respect to the Company’s operations. We do not tolerate discrimination against individuals on the basis of race, color, gender, religion, political opinion, nationality, sexual orientation or social origin, or harassment of individuals freely employed. We are committed to the protection of minority groups’ rights and women’s rights. The Company recognizes the right to water as a fundamental human right. FNHC recognizes and respects the freedom to join or refrain from joining legally authorized associations or organizations and respects the safety and health of workers. The Company does not tolerate threats, intimidation or attacks against human rights defenders. In its relationship with host governments, contractors and third-party service providers, the Company seeks to avoid being complicit in adverse human rights impacts. Our principle is that where national law and international human rights standards differ, we will follow the higher standard; where they are in conflict, we will adhere to national law, while seeking ways to respect international human rights to the greatest extent possible.
As an insurance holding company, the Company relies on its employees to perform a substantial portion of the insurance- and support-related services for our insurance subsidiaries, including policy underwriting, marketing, risk management and claims management. As of December 31, 2021, we had 341 employees, all based in the United States. The Company considers its employees to be critical to accomplishing its corporate goals, which are focused on providing unparalleled service to its insureds and its agents. In addition to providing competitive compensation and benefits discussed below, the Company believes that providing a compelling work environment for its employees is important to its success. Doing so among other things, helps our employees improve their well-being, understand the value of their work, develop their careers and thrive in a diverse and inclusive environment. To that end, the Company provides a variety of employee-focused benefits, including:
•The Company has for the past several years provided eligible employees with opportunities for remote work. Having an existing infrastructure for remote work allowed the Company to seamlessly transition to an entirely remote work environment during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Company provides varied support options for eligible employees, including Company-issued computers and monitors, IT support and flexible scheduling.
•We reimburse eligible employees who are required to maintain licenses or certifications as part of their job responsibilities all associated fees to maintain these licenses and certifications, and provide a Company-paid platform for all required continuing education.
•The Company encourages all of its employees to continue their education to improve knowledge, responsibility and growth in their professional careers. The Company has established, for the benefit of its employees, an Education Assistance Program, through which the Company reimburses expenses to eligible employees for collegiate degree programs and professional industry designations at approved institutions.
•FNHC has an environmental policy to promote social responsibility by integrating environmental concerns into the Company’s business operations. The Company has provided resources and technology to its employees to reduce their use of consumables, including virtual printing and electronic document collaboration, file storage, signature collection and forms. These measures have enabled the Company to substantially reduce its use of paper and printer toner.
We work continuously with our employees and managers to ensure that they are well informed and trained with regard to the impacts our business can have in order to increase their ability to protect human rights and related issues. We provide expectations and recognize the importance of dialogue with our employees, workers and external stakeholders who are or could potentially be affected by our actions. We offer paid time off, in addition to benefits and wellness programs focusing on the physical, social and financial well-being of our employees. For eligible employees, such programs include: 
•medical, dental and vision plans and a health savings account;
•a well-being program;
•an employee assistance program;
•a dependent care flexible spending account;
•third-party consultants to evaluate employee retirement readiness and help them map out ways to improve;
•our employee 401(k) plan with a company match; and
•accident and critical illness insurance coverages, short- and long-term disability plans, and company-provided life insurance.

Our business depends on adequate levels of staff to service our new business and policies in force, manage and resolve reported claims, and provide support services to the Company. These support services include technology, human resources, finance and internal audit teams. We anticipate staffing needs and make changes to our staff as needed to meet the needs of our operations and regulatory requirements, and to achieve our service standards to our insureds. We are able to expand our workforce as needed in connection with weather events through relationships with trusted subcontractors. We continue our support of diversity to create an inclusive culture to enhance performance and broaden perspectives. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.
We are committed to managing our direct environmental impacts in a responsible manner to ensure environmental laws and recognized standards are met. As a property and casualty insurance company, natural catastrophes are among the most serious risks facing our customers and communities. Climate change is increasing the unpredictability of catastrophes, such as hurricanes, floods, severe convective storms and wildfires, and causing significant property losses. Our responsive claims team helps restore our customers’ lives after a catastrophic loss. We have taken active steps to allocate capital through underwriting initiatives away from environmentally hazardous classes of business. Our enterprise risk management framework, overseen by senior management and the Board, models and assesses loss probabilities. To reduce the impact of climate change, we are reducing our environmental footprint and investing in building a more sustainable environment for future generations. At our headquarters, we have implemented paperless policies, reduced power and water usage, and recycled more commingled materials than in past years.
We strive to create a sustainable workplace for our employees, our community, and our planet, with an objective towards preserving our environment for future generations. As a property and casualty insurance company, we understand the risks posed by climate change and seek to mitigate catastrophe risk for our customers and shareholders through prudent exposure management, underwriting initiatives, and proactive notifications. Our underwriting and claims functions restrict or eliminate the use of paper communications and record retention in favor of digital media. We acknowledge our responsibility to reduce the environmental impacts of our business operations. 
COMPETITION
We face competition from national, regional and residual market insurance companies in the homeowners and flood insurance markets in which we operate. Our competitors include companies that market their products through agents and companies that sell insurance directly to their customers. Large national captive writers may have certain competitive advantages over independent agency writers, including increased name recognition, increased loyalty of their customer base, and reduced policy acquisition costs. Adverse loss experience and increasing catastrophe reinsurance costs in recent years could also potentially disrupt smaller competitors that lack adequate scale.
Three of our larger competitors in Florida currently are Citizens, Universal Property and Casualty Insurance Company, and Heritage Property and Casualty Insurance Company. As the legislatively created insurance company in Florida, Citizens is free of many of the constraints on private carriers, such as minimum surplus, financial ratio requirements, income tax and reinsurance expense. Other states in which we have policies have similar mechanisms to provide insurance to consumers who are not able to obtain coverage in the private market.
REGULATION
Overview
Our current insurance operations are subject to the laws and regulations of Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, South Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi. The regulations cover all aspects of our business and are generally designed to protect the interests of insurance policyholders, as opposed to the interests of shareholders. Such regulations relate to authorized lines of business, capital and surplus requirements, allowable rates and forms, investment parameters, underwriting limitations, transactions with affiliates, dividend limitations, changes in control, market conduct, maximum amount allowable for premium financing service charges and a variety of other financial and non-financial components of our business. Our failure to comply with certain provisions of applicable insurance laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, any changes in such laws and regulations, including the adoption of consumer initiatives regarding rates charged for coverage, could materially and adversely affect our operations or our ability to expand.
Most states’ laws restrict an insurer’s underwriting discretion, such as the ability to terminate policies, terminate agents or reject insurance coverage applications, and many state regulators have the power to reduce, or to disallow, increases in premium rates. In addition, state laws generally require that rate schedules and other information be filed with the state’s insurance regulatory authority, either directly or through a rating organization with which the insurer is affiliated. The regulatory authority may disapprove a rate filing if it finds that the rates are inadequate, excessive or unfairly discriminatory. Rates, which are not necessarily uniform for all insurers, 
-- 


vary by class of business, hazard covered, and size of risk. Certain states, including Florida, as discussed above, have adopted laws or are considering proposed legislation which, among other things, limit the ability of insurance companies to effect rate increases or to cancel, reduce or non-renew insurance coverage with respect to existing policies, particularly personal automobile insurance.
Most states require licensure or regulatory approval prior to the marketing of new insurance products. Typically, licensure review is comprehensive and includes a review of a company’s business plan, solvency, financial projections, reinsurance, character of its officers and directors, rates, forms and other financial and non-financial aspects of a company. The regulatory authorities may prohibit entry into a new market by not granting a license or by withholding approval.
All insurance companies must file quarterly and annual statements with certain regulatory agencies and are subject to regular and special examinations by those agencies. We may be the subject of additional special examinations or analysis. These examinations or analysis may result in one or more corrective orders being issued by the respective states’ regulatory authority. Florida and Louisiana have completed their examinations of FNIC and MNIC with no significant findings. The Texas Department of Insurance is conducting a limited scope exam of MIC’s operations in Texas
Various states routinely require deposits of assets for the protection of policyholders either in those states or for all policyholders. As of December 31, 2021, FNIC, MIC and MNIC held investment securities with a fair value of approximately $9.3 million, as deposits with the states of Florida, Texas, Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi.
On July 1, 2019, Florida legislation to address Assignments of Benefits ("AOB") took effect. AOB is the assignment of benefits for a claim where a service provider agrees to make a repair that may be covered by an insurance policy in exchange for the policyholder's right to sue the insurance carrier directly. AOB has substantially increased over the last few years, leading to material adverse losses, particularly from our Florida homeowners insurance policies, due to inflated claims, attorney's fees and costs. Provisions and limitations in this legislation are intended to reduce inflated claims as well as offset negative claims trends. Since this AOB reform was enacted, the Company has seen a decrease in AOB-related lawsuits. Additionally, incremental adverse non-AOB claim trends are currently offsetting any initial favorable impact of the AOB legislation. 
Please see Item 7 — “Item I. Business — Going Concern” and “Item 1A — Risk Factors” for potential regulatory impacts related to the Company’s conclusion that there is substantial doubt regarding its ability to continue as a going concern.
COVID-19 Impact
To slow and limit the COVID-19 outbreak and protect individuals and the health care systems worldwide, local and Federal governments have taken containment actions, including travel restrictions, testing, contact tracing and lockdowns. Companies have required working from home and in many cases laid off employees. These factors among others have caused global financial markets to experience extreme volatility and disruptions to capital and credit markets. In advance of government mandates, we implemented procedures to help reduce the spread of the outbreak, including having most of our employees work remotely, that are intended to prioritize the safety and health of our employees. In addition, we remained focused on the needs of our insureds and independent agents and fulfilling regulatory requirements and guidelines. During 2020 and 2021, we did not see a material impact of COVID-19 to our operations, financial condition and results. We currently believe that we have limited, if any, exposure to the pandemic based on our product offerings and contractual coverages, although possible actions that our regulators or other governmental or judicial entities may take may materially adversely impact our coverages in both a retrospective and go-forward manner. We continue our focus on maintaining the safety, security and health of all our stakeholders, including policyholders, employees, partner agents, vendors and shareholders, and monitoring the impacts of the pandemic on our operations, financial condition and results. Based on the Company's already existing business continuity plan, which we have implemented to address local catastrophes events, and based on our financial condition and anticipated operating cash flows, we currently expect to continue to meet our working capital and operating expenditure requirements, even if there is further economic downturn from the pandemic.
Insurance Holding Company Regulation
FNHC, as the parent holding company, is subject to laws governing insurance holding companies in Florida where FNIC and MNIC are domiciled or Louisiana where MIC is domiciled. Among other things, these laws: (i) require us to file periodic information with the OIR, including information concerning our capital structure, ownership, financial condition and general business operations; (ii) regulate certain transactions between us and our affiliates, including the amount of dividends and other distributions, the terms of surplus notes and amounts that our affiliates can charge the holding company for services such as management fees or commissions; and (iii) restrict the ability of any one person to acquire certain levels of our voting securities without prior regulatory approval. Any purchaser of 10% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock will be presumed to have acquired control of FNIC, MIC or MNIC and is required to file an application with the OIR or Louisiana Department of Insurance ("LDI") to obtain approval of such acquisition.

Restrictions in Payments of Dividends by Domestic Insurance Companies
Under Florida law, a domestic insurer may not pay any dividend or distribute cash or other property to its shareholders except out of that part of its available and accumulated capital surplus funds which is derived from realized net operating profits on its business and net realized capital gains. A Florida domestic insurer may not make dividend payments or distributions to shareholders without prior approval of the OIR if the dividend or distribution would exceed the larger of (i) the lesser of (a) 10.0% of its surplus or (b) net income, not including realized capital gains, plus a two-year carryforward, (ii) 10.0% of surplus with dividends payable constrained to unassigned funds minus 25.0% of unrealized capital gains or (iii) the lesser of (a) 10.0% of surplus or (b) net investment income plus a three-year carryforward with dividends payable constrained to unassigned funds minus 25.0% of unrealized capital gains.
Alternatively, a Florida domestic insurer may pay a dividend or distribution without the prior written approval of the OIR: (i) if the dividend is equal to or less than the greater of: (a) 10.0% of the insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders derived from realized net operating profits on its business and net realized capital gains or (b) the insurer’s entire net operating profits and realized net capital gains derived during the immediately preceding calendar year; (ii) the insurer will have policy holder surplus equal to or exceeding 115.0% of the minimum required statutory surplus after the dividend or distribution; (iii) the insurer files a notice of the dividend or distribution with the OIR at least ten business days prior to the dividend payment or distribution; and (iv) the notice includes a certification by an officer of the insurer attesting that, after the payment of the dividend or distribution, the insurer will have at least 115.0% of required statutory surplus as to policyholders. Except as provided above, a Florida domiciled insurer may only pay a dividend or make a distribution: (i) subject to prior approval by the OIR; or (ii) 30 days after the OIR has received notice of such dividend or distribution and has not disapproved it within such time.
Under Louisiana law, a domestic insurer may not declare or pay any dividend to its stockholders unless its capital is fully paid in cash and is unimpaired and it has a surplus beyond its capital stock and the initial minimum surplus required and all other liabilities equal to fifteen percent of its capital stock, provided that this restriction does not apply when an insurer's paid-in capital and surplus exceeds the minimum required by Louisiana law by one hundred percent or more. No extraordinary dividend or other extraordinary distribution to its shareholders may be made until 30 days after the Louisiana Commissioner of Insurance has received notice of the declaration thereof and has not within that period disapproved the payment, or has approved the payment within the thirty-day period. An extraordinary dividend or distribution includes any dividend or distribution of cash or other property, whose fair market value together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months exceeds the lesser of (a) 10.0% percent of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders as of the 31st day of December next preceding; or (b) the net income, not including realized capital gains, for the twelve-month period ending the 31st day of December next preceding, but shall not include pro rata distributions of any class of the insurer's own securities. In determining whether a dividend or distribution is extraordinary, an insurer may carry forward net income from the previous two calendar years that has not already been paid out as dividends. This carryforward shall be computed by taking the net income from the second and third preceding calendar years, not including realized capital gains, less dividends paid in the second and immediately preceding calendar years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an insurer may declare an extraordinary dividend or distribution which is conditional upon regulatory approval. and the declaration shall confer no rights upon shareholders until either the payment is approved or has not been disapproved within the 30 day period referred to above.
No dividends were paid by FNIC or MNIC in 2021, 2020 and 2019, and none are anticipated in 2022. No dividends were paid by MIC since the acquisition date, and none are anticipated in 2022. Although we believe that amounts required to meet our financial and operating obligations will be available from sources other than dividends from our insurance subsidiaries, there can be no assurance in this regard. Further, there can be no assurance that, if requested, the OIR or LDI will allow any dividends to be paid by FNIC, MIC or MNIC to FNHC, the parent company, in the future. The maximum dividends permitted by state law are not necessarily indicative of an insurer’s actual ability to pay dividends or other distributions to a parent company, which also may be constrained by business and regulatory considerations, such as the impact of dividends on surplus, which could affect an insurer’s competitive position, the amount of premiums that can be written and the ability to pay future dividends. Further, state insurance laws and regulations require that the statutory surplus of an insurance company following any dividend or distribution by it be reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate for its financial needs.
While the non-insurance company subsidiaries (FNU and any other affiliate) are not subject directly to the dividend and other distribution limitations, insurance holding company regulations govern the amount that any affiliate within the holding company structure may charge any of the insurance companies for services (e.g., management fees and commissions).

Underwriting and Marketing Restrictions
During the past several years, various regulatory and legislative bodies have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations to address the cyclical nature of the insurance industry, catastrophic events and insurance capacity and pricing. These regulations include: (i) the creation of “market assistance plans” under which insurers are induced to provide certain coverages; (ii) restrictions on the ability of insurers to rescind or otherwise cancel certain policies in mid-term; (iii) advance notice requirements or limitations imposed for certain policy non-renewals; and (iv) limitations upon or decreases in rates permitted to be charged.
Risk-Based Capital Requirements
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) provides risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements for insurance companies that are designed to assess capital adequacy and to raise the level of protection that statutory surplus provides for policy holders. These requirements measure four major areas of risk facing property and casualty insurers: (i) underwriting risks, which encompass the risk of adverse loss development and inadequate pricing; (ii) declines in asset values arising from credit risk; (iii) other business risks from investments; and (iv) catastrophe risk. Insurers having less statutory surplus than required will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action, depending on the level of capital inadequacy. 
The OIR and LDI, which follow these requirements, could require FNIC, MIC or MNIC to cease operations in the event they fail to maintain the required statutory capital. Based upon the 2021 and 2020 statutory financial statements for FNIC, MIC and MNIC, statutory surplus exceeded the regulatory action levels established by the NAIC’s RBC requirements.
Based on RBC requirements, the extent of regulatory intervention and action increases as the ratio of an insurer’s statutory surplus to its Authorized Control Level (“ACL”), as calculated under the NAIC’s requirements, decreases. The first action level, the Company Action Level, requires an insurer to submit a plan of corrective actions to the insurance regulators if statutory surplus falls below 200% of the ACL amount. The second action level, the Regulatory Action Level, requires an insurer to submit a plan containing corrective actions and permits the insurance regulators to perform an examination or other analysis and issue a corrective order if statutory surplus falls below 150% of the ACL amount. The third action level, ACL, allows the regulators to rehabilitate or liquidate an insurer in addition to the aforementioned actions if statutory surplus falls below the ACL amount. The fourth action level is the Mandatory Control Level, which requires the regulators to rehabilitate or liquidate the insurer if statutory surplus falls below 70% of the ACL amount. 
FNIC’s ratio of statutory surplus to its ACL was 313% ($99,369 / $31,703) and 303% ($105,920 / $35,020) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. MNIC’s ratio of statutory surplus to its ACL was 1,152% ($20,256 / $1,759) and 736% ($18,264 / $2,482) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. MIC's ratio of statutory surplus to its ACL was 305% ($30,848 / $10,116) and 348% ($39,282 / $11,288) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We expect that the statutory surplus levels of our insurance subsidiaries to be negatively impacted by the severe weather occurring in our markets in the first quarter of 2022.
Industry Ratings Services
Third-party rating agencies assess and rate the ability of insurers to pay their claims. The insurance industry uses financial strength ratings to assess the financial strength and quality of insurers. Ratings are based upon criteria established by the rating agencies and reflect evaluations of each insurer’s profitability, debt and cash levels, customer base, adequacy and soundness of reinsurance, quality and estimated market value of assets, adequacy of reserves and management. Ratings are also based upon factors of concern to agents, reinsurers and policyholders, including RBC requirements, and are not directed toward the protection of investors, such as purchasers of our common stock.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, FNIC and MNIC were rated by Demotech as “A” (“Exceptional”), which is the third highest of eight ratings, and is defined as “Regardless of the severity of a general economic downturn or deterioration in the insurance cycle, insurers earning a Financial Stability Rating ("FSR") of “A” possess “Exceptional” financial stability related to maintaining surplus as regards to policyholders.” Maintenance of statutory surplus at or above 300% of the ACL amount is considered necessary to maintain a Demotech rating. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, MIC was rated by Demotech as "NR" ("Not Rated") and "A" ("Exceptional"), respectively. "NR" is the seventh highest of eight ratings, and defined as "insurers that are Not Rated do not currently have an FSR." MIC's "NR" rating materialized as Demotech withdrew its rating of MIC in November 2021 in conjunction with our decision to execute an orderly runoff of MIC's book of business. MIC's change in rating is independent of FNIC's and MNIC's rating. MNIC’s rating was recently reaffirmed; however, Demotech has notified the Company that it has downgraded FNIC’s rating by one notch to “S” (“Substantial”).
Demotech’s ratings are based upon factors of concern to agents, reinsurers and policyholders and are not primarily directed toward the protection of investors. Our Demotech rating will be jeopardized by factors including recurring underwriting losses, adverse loss

reserve development and various surplus related ratio exceptions (e.g., FNHC's insurance carriers ratio of statutory surplus to its ACL falling below 300%).
