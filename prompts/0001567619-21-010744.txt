Overview
 
We were a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on June 18, 2018 formed for the purposes of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to as our initial business combination.  While we may have pursued an initial business combination target in any stage of its corporate evolution or in any industry or sector, we focused our search on global natural resource companies and related infrastructure, value chain and logistics businesses.
 
Our sponsor, AMCI Sponsor LLC, is an affiliate of the AMCI Group of companies, founded in 1986 by Hans J. Mende and Fritz R. Kundrun. The AMCI Group of companies is a privately held natural resources investment management company that manages various assets in the natural resource industry globally, owning businesses across the value chain of energy and metal commodities with strategic investments in steelmaking coal, minerals, metals, energy and transportation.
 
The registration statement for the Company’s initial public offering was declared effective on November 15, 2018. On November 20, 2018, the Company consummated the initial public offering of 20,000,000 units (“Units” and, with respect to the shares of Class A common stock included in the Units sold), generating total gross proceeds of $200,000,000.
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, the Company consummated the sale of an aggregate of 5,500,000 warrants (the “Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per warrant in a private placement to our sponsor, generating total gross proceeds of $5,500,000.
 
Following the closing of the initial public offering on November 20, 2018, an amount of $200,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the initial public offering and the sale of the Placement Warrants was placed in a trust account (“Trust Account”) to be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 180 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of an initial business combination or (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account.
 
On November 27, 2018, the Company closed on the sale of 2,052,077 additional units at a price of $10.00 per unit upon receiving notice of the underwriters’ election to partially exercise their over-allotment option, generating additional gross proceeds of $20,520,770, which were placed in the Trust Account and incurring additional offering costs of $410,416 in underwriting fees, which were paid via purchase by our sponsor of an additional 410,416 Placement Warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant. As a result of the partial exercise of the over-allotment option by the underwriters and the expiration of the remaining portion of the over-allotment option, our sponsor forfeited 236,981 founder shares.
 
On October 12, 2020, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended on October 19, 2020 and amended again on December 31, 2020, the “Merger Agreement”) with AMCI Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), AMCI Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Sponsor”), solely in the capacity as the representative from and after the effective time of the Business Combination (as defined below) (the “Effective Time”) for the shareholders of the Company (other than the Advent stockholders) (the “Purchaser Representative”), Advent Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Advent”), and Vassilios Gregoriou, solely in his capacity as the representative from and after the Effective Time for the Advent stockholders (the “Seller Representative”).

Recent Developments
 
On February 4, 2021, we consummated a business combination (the “Closing”) pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, including the merger of Merger Sub with and into Advent, with Advent continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement (the “Business Combination”).
 
In connection with the Closing, the Company changed its name to “Advent Technologies Holdings, Inc.” and each outstanding share of Class A common stock, including any shares of Class B common stock that were converted into shares of Class A common stock, were redesignated as common stock. We continued the listing of our common stock and public warrants on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) under the symbols “ADN” and “ADNWW”, respectively.  Prior to the Closing, our Class A common stock, public warrants and units were listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbols “AMCI”, “AMCIW” and “AMCIU”. The units automatically separated into their component securities upon consummation of the Business Combination and, as a result, no longer trade as a separate security.
 
Advent is an advanced materials and technology development company operating in the fuel cell and hydrogen technology space. Advent develops, manufactures and assembles the critical components that determine the performance of hydrogen fuel cells and other energy systems. Advent’s core product offering is the Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) at the center of the fuel cell. The Advent MEA, which derives its key benefits from the properties of Advent’s engineered membrane technology, enables a more robust, longer-lasting and ultimately lower-cost fuel cell product.
 
Further information regarding the Business Combination and Advent is set forth in (i) the definitive proxy statement / prospectus filed by us with the SEC on January 20, 2021 (the “Proxy Statement / Prospectus”) and (ii) our current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 9, 2021 and as amended on February 9, 2021 (the “Super 8-K”).  The Super 8-K will be amended to report Advent’s audited financial results and other information for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.
 
Except as otherwise expressly provided below, this Annual Report on Form 10-K/A does not reflect the consummation of the Business Combination which, as discussed above, occurred subsequent to the period covered hereunder.
 
Employees
 
Prior to the Business Combination, we had 4 executive officers and following the Business Combination we have 5 executive officers. Members of our management team were not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they devoted as much of their time as they deemed necessary to our affairs until we completed the Business Combination. Prior to the Business Combination, the amount of time that any member of our management team devoted in any time period may varied based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the initial business combination process.
