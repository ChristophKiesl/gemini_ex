PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND STRATEGIES
Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls
Products and Services
We have been involved in the chlor alkali industry for more than 120 years and are a major participant in the global chlor alkali industry.  Chlorine, caustic soda and hydrogen are co-produced commercially by the electrolysis of salt.  These co-produced products are produced simultaneously, and in a fixed ratio of 1.0 ton of chlorine to 1.1 tons of caustic soda and 0.03 tons of hydrogen.  The industry refers to this as an Electrochemical Unit or ECU.  With a demonstrated capacity of 5.8 million ECUs as of the end of 2016, we have the largest global chlor alkali capacity, according to data from IHS, Inc. (IHS). IHS is a global information consulting company established in 1959 that provides information to a variety of industries.

Chlorine is used as a raw material in the production of thousands of products, including vinyls, urethanes, epoxy, water treatment chemicals and a variety of other organic and inorganic chemicals.  A significant portion of chlorine production is consumed in the manufacture of ethylene dichloride (EDC) and vinyl chloride monomer (VCM), both of which Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls produces. A large portion of our EDC production is utilized in the production of VCM, but we are also one of the largest global participants in merchant EDC sales. EDC and VCM are precursors for polyvinyl chloride, or PVC. PVC is a plastic used in applications such as vinyl siding, pipe, pipe fittings and automotive parts.
Our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment is one of the largest global marketers of caustic soda, including caustic soda produced by TDCC in Brazil. The off-take arrangement with TDCC in Brazil entitles the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment the right to market and sell the caustic soda produced at TDCC’s Aratu, Brazil site. The diversity of caustic sourcing allows us to cost effectively supply customers worldwide. Caustic soda has a wide variety of end-use applications, the largest of which include water treatment, alumina, pulp and paper, urethanes, detergents and soaps and a variety of other organic and inorganic chemicals.
Our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment also includes the acquired chlorinated organics business which is the largest global producer of chlorinated organic products that include chloromethanes (methyl chloride, methylene chloride, chloroform and carbon tetrachloride) and chloroethenes (perchloroethylene, trichloroethylene, and vinylidene chloride). Chlorinated organics participates in both the solvent segment, as well as the intermediate segment of the global chlorocarbon industry with a focus on sustainable applications and in applications where we can benefit from our cost advantages. Intermediate products are used as feedstocks in the production of fluoropolymers, fluorocarbon refrigerants and blowing agents, silicones, cellulosics and agricultural chemicals. Solvent products are sold into end uses such as surface preparation, dry cleaning, pharmaceuticals and regeneration of refining catalysts. This business’s unique technology allows us to utilize both hydrochloric acid and chlorinated hydrocarbon byproducts (RCl), produced by our other production processes, as raw materials in an integrated system. These manufacturing facilities also consume chlorine, which generates caustic soda production and sales.
We also manufacture and sell other chlor alkali-related products, including hydrochloric acid, sodium hypochlorite (bleach) and potassium hyrdroxide, which we refer to as co-products. The production of co-products, chlorinated organics and epoxy generally consume chlorine as a raw material creating downstream applications that upgrade the value of chlorine and enable caustic soda production. As industry leaders in chlorinated organics and epoxy resins, the addition of the Acquired Business creates integrated outlets for our captive chlorine. With the addition of the Acquired Business, we have increased the diversification of our high value outlets for chlorine from three to nineteen.
The Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment’s products are delivered by pipeline, marine vessel, deep-water and coastal barge, railcar and truck. Our chemical distribution infrastructure provides us with geographically advantaged storage capacity and provides us with a private fleet of trucks, tankers and trailers that expands our geographic coverage and enhance our service capabilities. At our largest integrated product sites, our deep-water access enables us to reach global markets.
Our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment maintains strong relationships with TDCC as both a customer and supplier. These relationships are maintained through long-term cost based contracts that provide us with a reliable supply of key raw materials and predictable and consistent demand for our end use products. Key products sold to TDCC include chlorine, cell effluent, chlorinated organics and VCM. Key raw materials received from TDCC include ethylene and electricity. Ethylene is supplied for the vinyl business under a long-term supply arrangement with TDCC whereby we receive ethylene at integrated producer economics. 
Electricity, salt and ethylene are the major purchased raw materials for our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment.  Electricity is the single largest raw material component in the production of chlor alkali vinyl products. Approximately 76% of our electricity is generated from natural gas or hydroelectric sources.  Approximately 85% of our salt requirements are met by internal supply. The high volume nature of this industry places an emphasis on cost management and we believe that our scale, integration and raw material positions make us one of the low cost producers in the industry.

Epoxy
Products and Services
With the addition of the Acquired Business, we acquired TDCC’s Global Epoxy business. The Epoxy business was one of the first major manufacturers of epoxy products, and has continued to build on a half a century of history through product innovation and technical excellence. According to data from IHS, the Epoxy segment is one of the largest fully integrated global producers of epoxy resins, curing agents and intermediates. The Epoxy segment has a favorable manufacturing cost position which is driven by a combination of scale and integration into low cost feedstocks (including chlorine, caustic soda, allylics and aromatics). The Epoxy segment produces and sells a full range of epoxy materials, including upstream products such as allyl chloride (Allyl) and epichlorohydrin (EPI), midstream products such as liquid epoxy resins (LER), and downstream products such as converted epoxy resins (CER) and additives.
The Epoxy segment serves a diverse array of applications, including wind energy, electrical laminates, marine coatings, consumer goods and composites, as well as numerous applications in civil engineering and protective coating. The Epoxy segment has important relationships with established customers, some of which span decades. Geographically, the Epoxy segment’s primary markets are North America and Western Europe. The segment’s product is delivered primarily by marine vessel, deep-water and coastal barge, railcar and truck.
Allyl has use, not only as a feedstock in the production of EPI, but also as a chemical intermediate in multiple industries and applications, including water purification chemicals. EPI is primarily produced as a feedstock for use in the business’s epoxy resins, and also sold to epoxy producers globally who produce their own resins for end use segments such as coatings and adhesives. LER is manufactured in liquid form and cures with the addition of a hardener into a thermoset solid material offering a distinct combination of strength, adhesion and chemical resistance that is well-suited to coatings and composites applications. While LER is sold externally, a portion of LER production is further converted into CER where value-added modifications produce higher margin customer-specific resins.
Our Epoxy segment maintains strong relationships with TDCC as both a customer and supplier. These relationships are maintained through long-term cost based contracts that provide us with a reliable supply of key raw materials. Key products sold to TDCC include aromatics and key raw materials received from TDCC include propylene and benzene.
The Epoxy segment’s production economics benefit from its integration into chlor alkali and aromatics which are key inputs in epoxy production. This fully integrated structure provides both access to low cost materials and significant operational flexibility. The Epoxy segment operates an integrated aromatics production chain producing cumene, phenol, acetone and bisphenol (BisA) for internal consumption and sale. The Epoxy segment’s consumption of chlorine allows the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment to generate caustic soda production and sales. Chlorine used in our Epoxy segment is transferred at cost from the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment.

CUSTOMERS AND DISTRIBUTION
Products we sell to industrial or commercial users or distributors for use in the production of other products constitute a major part of our total sales.  We sell some of our products, such as epoxy resins, caustic soda and sporting ammunition, to a large number of users or distributors, while we sell others, such as chlorine and chlorinated organics in substantial quantities to a relatively small number of industrial users.  With the addition of the Acquired Business, we entered into or have significant relationships with a few customers including TDCC, who was our largest customer by revenue in 2016. We expect these relationships to continue to be significant to Olin and to represent more than 10% of our annual sales in the future. During 2016, sales to TDCC represented approximately 15% of our total sales. No other single customer accounted for more than 4% of sales. We discuss the customers for each of our three business segments in more detail above under “Products and Services.”
We market most of our products and services primarily through our sales force and sell directly to various industrial customers, mass merchants, retailers, wholesalers, other distributors and the U.S. Government and its prime contractors.
Sales to all U.S. Government agencies and sales under U.S. Government contracting activities in total accounted for approximately 2% of sales in 2016.  Because we engage in some government contracting activities and make sales to the U.S. Government, we are subject to extensive and complex U.S. Government procurement laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations provide for ongoing government audits and reviews of contract procurement, performance and administration.  
Failure to comply, even inadvertently, with these laws and regulations and with laws governing the export of munitions and other controlled products and commodities could subject us or one or more of our businesses to civil and criminal penalties, and under certain circumstances, suspension and debarment from future government contracts and the exporting of products for a specified period of time.
BACKLOG
The total amount of contracted backlog was approximately $316.7 million and $312.5 million as of January 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  The backlog orders are in our Winchester business.  Backlogs in our other businesses are not significant. Backlog is comprised of all open customer orders not yet shipped.  Approximately 75% of contracted backlog as of January 31, 2017 is expected to be filled during 2017.
COMPETITION
We are in active competition with businesses producing or distributing the same or similar products, as well as, in some instances, with businesses producing or distributing different products designed for the same uses.
Chlor alkali manufacturers in North America, with approximately 17 million tons of chlorine and 18 million tons of caustic soda capacity, account for approximately 17% of worldwide chlor alkali production capacity.  According to IHS, we have the largest chlor alkali capacity in North America and globally. While the technologies to manufacture and transport chlorine and caustic soda are widely available, the production facilities require large capital investments, and are subject to significant regulatory and permitting requirements. Approximately 76% of the total North American chlor alkali capacity is located in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. There is a worldwide market for caustic soda, which attracts imports and allows exports depending on market conditions. Other large chlor alkali producers in North America include The Occidental Petroleum Corporation (Oxy) and Westlake Chemical Corporation (Westlake).  
We are also a leading integrated global producer of chlorinated organic products with a strong cost position due to our scale and access to chlor alkali feedstocks. This industry includes large diversified producers such as Oxy, Westlake and Solvay S.A., as well as multiple producers located in China.
We are a major global fully integrated epoxy producer, with access to key low cost feedstocks and a cost advantaged infrastructure. The markets in which our Epoxy segment operates are highly competitive and are dependent on significant capital investment, the development of proprietary technology and maintenance of product research and development. Among our competitors are Huntsman Corporation, Trinseo S.A. and Hexion, Inc.
9

We are among the largest manufacturers in the U.S. of commercial small caliber ammunition based on independent market research sponsored by the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF).  Formed in 1961, NSSF has a membership of more than 8,000 manufacturers, distributors, firearms retailers, shooting ranges, sportsman’s organizations and publishers. According to NSSF, our Winchester business, Vista Outdoor Inc. (Vista), and Remington Outdoor Company, Inc. (Remington) are the three largest commercial ammunition manufacturers in the U.S.  The ammunition industry is highly competitive with us, Vista, Remington, numerous smaller domestic manufacturers and foreign producers competing for sales to the commercial ammunition customers.  Many factors influence our ability to compete successfully, including price, delivery, service, performance, product innovation and product recognition and quality, depending on the product involved.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 6,400 employees, with 5,300 working in the U.S. and 1,100 working in foreign countries.  Various labor unions represent a significant number of our hourly-paid employees for collective bargaining purposes.
The following labor contracts are scheduled to expire in early 2018:

Location | Number of Employees | Expiration Date
Lemont (Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls) | 20 | March 2018 
Becancour (Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls) | 97 | April 2018 

While we believe our relations with our employees and their various representatives are generally satisfactory, we cannot assure that we can conclude these labor contracts or any other labor agreements without work stoppages and cannot assure that any work stoppages will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
RESEARCH ACTIVITIES; PATENTS
Our research activities are conducted on a product-group basis at a number of facilities.  Company-sponsored research expenditures were $10.9 million in 2016, $4.9 million in 2015 and $4.1 million in 2014.
We own or license a number of patents, patent applications and trade secrets covering our products and processes.  We believe that, in the aggregate, the rights under our patents and licenses are important to our operations, but we do not consider any individual patent, license or group of patents and licenses related to a specific process or product to be of material importance to our total business.
SEASONALITY
Our sales are affected by the cyclicality of the economy and the seasonality of several industries we serve, including building and construction, coatings, infrastructure, electronics, automotive, bleach, refrigerants and ammunition. The seasonality of the ammunition business is typically driven by the U.S. fall hunting season. Our chlor alkali businesses generally experience their highest level of activity during the spring and summer months, particularly when construction, refrigerants, coatings and infrastructure activity is higher. The chlor alkali industry is cyclical, both as a result of changes in demand for each of the co-produced products and as a result of the large increments in which new capacity is added and removed.  Because chlorine and caustic soda are produced in a fixed ratio, the supply of one product can be constrained both by the physical capacity of the production facilities and/or by the ability to sell the co-produced product.  Prices for both products respond rapidly to changes in supply and demand. The cyclicality of the chlor alkali industry has further impacts on downstream products. With the addition of the Acquired Business, we have significantly increased the diversification of our chlorine outlets allowing us to better manage the cyclical nature of the industry.
RAW MATERIALS AND ENERGY
Basic raw materials are processed through an integrated manufacturing process to produce a number of products that are sold at various points throughout the process. We purchase a portion of our raw material requirements and also utilize internal resources, co-products and finished goods as raw materials for downstream products. We believe we have reliable sources of supply for our raw materials under normal market conditions. However, we cannot predict the likelihood or impact of any future raw material shortages.
10

The principal basic raw materials for our production of Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls’ products are electricity, salt, ethylene, potassium chloride, methanol and hydrogen.  A portion of our purchases of our raw materials, including ethylene and electricity, are made under long-term supply agreements, while approximately 85% of the salt used in our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment is produced from internal resources.
The Epoxy segment’s principal raw materials are chlorine, benzene, propylene and aromatics which consist of cumene, phenol, acetone and BisA. A portion of our purchases of our raw materials, including benzene, propylene and a portion of our aromatics requirements, are made under long-term supply agreements, while a portion of our aromatics requirements are produced from our integrated production chain. Chlorine is predominately sourced from our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment.
Lead, brass and propellant are the principal raw materials used in the Winchester business.  We typically purchase our ammunition cartridge case cups and copper-based strip, and propellants pursuant to multi-year contracts.
Electricity is the predominant energy source for our manufacturing facilities.  Approximately 76% of our electricity is generated from natural gas or hydroelectric sources. In conjunction with the Acquisition, we entered into long-term power supply contracts with TDCC in addition to acquiring power assets which allow for cost differentiation at specific U.S. manufacturing sites. During 2016, Olin entered into additional arrangements to increase our supply of low cost electricity. 
We provide additional information with respect to specific raw materials in the tables set forth under “Products and Services.”
ENVIRONMENTAL AND TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROLS
As is common in our industry, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations related to the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation, emission, discharge, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes in all of the countries in which we do business.
The establishment and implementation of national, state or provincial and local standards to regulate air, water and land quality affect substantially all of our manufacturing locations around the world.  Laws providing for regulation of the manufacture, transportation, use and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances, and remediation of contaminated sites have imposed additional regulatory requirements on industry, particularly the chemicals industry.  In addition, implementation of environmental laws has required and will continue to require new capital expenditures and will increase operating costs.
We employ waste minimization and pollution prevention programs at our manufacturing sites and we are a party to various governmental and private environmental actions associated with former waste disposal sites and past manufacturing facilities.  Charges to income for investigatory and remedial efforts were $9.2 million, $15.7 million and $9.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These charges may be material to operating results in future years.
