Item 1. Description of Business.
 
 Brazil Minerals, Inc. ("Brazil Minerals", the "Company", "we", "us", or "our"), together with its subsidiaries, is engaged in the business of acquiring controlling positions or significant positions with oversight roles in companies in Brazil in the minerals area or in industries related to minerals. We consolidate the results of our controlled subsidiaries in this Annual Report.
 
Our progress has been steady, and can be measured in at least two quantifiable ways. First, in terms of mineral assets, in early 2013, our initial year of operations under the current business model and management team, we had 3 mineral rights. As of December 31, 2016, we had 38 mineral rights, as follows:
 

a) | 10 mineral rights that are mining concessions, the highest level of mineral right in Brazil ("Concessão de Lavra"); 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
b) | 8 mineral rights that have status just below mining concession ("Requerimento de Lavra"), which allows us to apply for both an upgrade to mining concession and to conduct limited commercial mining;
c) | 8 mineral rights in the research permit phase ("Autorização de Resquisa"); and 
d) | 12 mineral rights in the phase of application for research permit ("Requerimento de Pesquisa"). 

 
   Details on each of these mineral rights can be found in Item 2. Properties of this Annual Report.
 
The second manner in which we expanded from 2013 to now is in the product mix output from our subsidiaries. In 2013, we produced and sold rough diamonds and gold. In 2014, we added polished diamonds. In 2015, we added sand and mortar, a product made from our sand.
 
From 2013 to today, we have been taking shape as a holding company. As of December 31, 2016, we materially owned the following stakes:



(1) | 100% of BMIX Participações Ltda ("BMIXP"); 
----+------------------------------------------------
(2) | 100% of Mineração Duas Barras Ltda ("MDB"); 
(3) | 50% of RST Recursos Minerais Ltda. ("RST"); 
(4) | 100% of Hercules Resources Corporation ("HRC");
(4) | 100% of Hercules Brasil Ltda. ("HBR"); 
(5) | 58% of Jupiter Gold Corporation ("JGC").

Business Developments     Some significant developments to our business during 2016 in chronological order were as follows:
 
 
1) | Licensing of a New Mining Area
---+-------------------------------



On April 19, 2016, the Brazilian government official gazette ("Diário Oficial da União") published the permit denominated "Guia de Utilização" issued by the Brazilian mining department that allowed to begin initial mining of the mineral rights area 802.267/1977 (please see table in Item 2. Properties of this Annual Report).
 
 
2) | Formation of Jupiter Gold Corporation.
---+---------------------------------------



In conversations with current and potential investors, we observed that certain groups want to be more heavily involved with diamonds, others prefer gold, and yet others are only interested in commodity-type minerals. Based on such observations and other data, we believe it to be in the best interest of the Company and our shareholders to create certain "mineral-specific" subsidiaries. Such strategy seeks to accommodate specific investor demand, and allow each subsidiary to raise its own capital. We intend to maintain an ongoing ownership stake in each subsidiary it creates; the specific percentage will depend both on the valuation given to the subsidiary at any point in time and the amount of capital it raises from outside sources.
 
Jupiter Gold Corporation ("JGC"), the first such subsidiary, was incorporated on July 27, 2016. On December 16, 2016, JGC's Registration Statement on Form F-1 was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). JGC anticipates being a publicly-traded entity in 2017.
 
 
3) | Improvements in Capital Structure
---+----------------------------------



 In 2016, we substantially improved the equity portion of our balance sheet by elimination of all of the Preferred B Convertible Stock and all of the Preferred C Convertible Stock that we had on our books. Such preferred shares were converted into shares of common stock of JCG, options on shares of common stock of JGC, and common shares of Brazil Minerals.
 
In 2016, we also improved the debt portion of its balance sheet by the net conversion of a significant amount of variable-rate convertible debt, with the result that as of year-end we had only one short-term oriented variable-rate noteholder left.


  
4) | Construction of Modular Gold and Diamond Processing Plant
---+----------------------------------------------------------


  During the second semester of 2016, Brazil Minerals achieved the deployment of a modular gold and diamond processing plant in one of its mineral areas. The plant uses centrifugation as the primary method of gold separation. Material identified as potentially containing diamonds is retrieved and further processed in specific high-precision equipment for detection of diamonds.


This modular plant is owned by JGC and is solely operated by Brazil Minerals which retains 100% of the diamonds and 50% of the gold recovered from it, while the other 50% of gold is for the account of JGC. Under standard U.S. GAAP consolidation of financial results for subsidiaries, any gold revenues obtained by JGC are added to the revenues of Brazil Minerals.

 
 
5) | Cashless Acquisition of New Truck
---+----------------------------------



In May 2016, a Mercedes Benz Accelo 1044 truck was acquired by MDB for no cash, and only the use of tax credits, in a cashless transaction. Generally, under the laws of the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil, certain purchases of diesel for mining operations earn tax credits that can be redeemed, under a state-sponsored program, for capital equipment built in that state..

Emerging Growth Company Status
 
We may be deemed to be an "emerging growth company" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act. As long as we remain an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not "emerging growth companies" including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding an annual nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and seeking nonbinding stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an "emerging growth company."
 
Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
 
We will remain an "emerging growth company" for up to five years, although we would cease to be an "emerging growth company" prior to such time if we have more than $1 billion in annual revenue, more than $700 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.
 
 Markets
 
Rough Diamonds
 
 The market for our rough diamonds is potentially global as we have attracted interest from foreign buyers. To date we have sold our rough diamonds only in Brazil and to Brazilian institutional buyers that represent merchants from other countries. We have the necessary Siscomex export license obtained from the Brazilian regulatory agency and therefore we can export rough diamonds in the future. The export process for rough diamonds involves obtaining the Kimberly certification on each rough diamond set being exported. This certificate is obtained in the local office of the Brazilian mining department and attests to the fact that we have all of the necessary licensing and that the diamonds are ethically produced. The Kimberly certification is a United Nations procedure to which Brazil is a signatory member; it seeks to eliminate from the global market the so-called "blood diamonds," mined under conditions of duress and without regard for the environment.
 
 The price of our rough diamonds is mostly determined by the overall global market price for diamonds of similar characteristics; the prices are quoted in U.S. dollars per carat. For each lot available, we have had several interested and potential buyers and normally receive multiple bids. On average, approximately 97% of our rough diamonds are of gem quality, whereas 3% are for industrial uses.
 
Polished Diamonds
 
 The market for our polished diamonds is global. To date we have sold our polished diamonds in Brazil and abroad. The sales in Brazil were made to a large jewelry chain that is in business since 1946 and caters to the medium-high end of the market. The sales of our polished diamonds to buyers from abroad were to high net worth individuals interested in acquisition for asset diversification as well as future use in jewelry pieces. Since we have the necessary export license, the export process is straightforward for polished diamonds.
 
The price for our polished diamonds is determined in the same method as for any other polished diamond, and thus primarily by the so-called four C's – color, carat weight, clarity, and cut. All of our exported diamonds to date have been certified and graded at the Gemological Institute of America ("GIA"), considered the premier analytical laboratory for diamonds and other gems in the world. The highest grade of color which our polished diamonds have obtained from GIA has been "E", the 2nd highest possible grade (the color scale starts at "D"). The best clarity our polished diamonds have obtained has been "VVS1", the 2nd best clarity possible. Most of our polished diamonds have been graded F-G for color and VVS2-VS2 for clarity. Their weights as polished gems have been approximately between 0.4 and 2.0 carats. The Rapaport valuation of our polished diamonds graded at GIA has been approximately $3,250 per carat. Rapaport is a premier diamond service provider that publishes well-known, periodic pricing valuations for diamonds based on the four C's, as described above. The prices for our diamonds are quoted in U.S. dollars.

Gold
 
  The market for our gold is local as there is normally demand from multiple Brazilian buyers. The price of our 96%-purity gold bars is determined by the London price for gold on the day of sale. The prices for our gold are quoted in U.S. dollars, and paid in Brazilian reais, the local currency
Sand
 
The market for our sand is local, driven by demands of residential and commercial construction. There are a large number of local buyers for our sand. Our sand was analyzed at a top analytical laboratory in Brazil and found to have high silica levels and low organic matter, both characteristics of high quality sand. We price our sand based on whether it is retrieved by the buyer directly in our sand mine versus being delivered by us, and the size of the trucks used, which determines the volume purchased. The prices for our sand are quoted in Brazilian reais.
Mortar
 
The market for our mortar is local, also driven by demands of residential and commercial construction. We sell mortar to stores and directly to the consumer. The prices for our mortar are quoted in Brazilian reais.
Demand
 
    When we have diamonds and gold for sale, demand for our products has been robust. We are constrained by logistical issues (e.g., waiting for permits from the mining department to begin mining), equipment malfunction (e.g., waiting for repair of excavator, tractor, etc.), and at times, working capital. There is no observed lack of demand for any of our diamonds and gold.
 
Overall, there has been an increase in the global demand for rough and polished diamonds, primarily driven by the improvement in the U.S. economy and continued repressed demand from emerging markets such as China and India. Gold has strong continued demand for both jewelry and as an alternative asset.
 
Demand for our sand and mortar has decreased during the Brazilian recessionary period lasting from 2014 through 2016, in which the economy declined almost 10%. Sand and mortar demand is directly correlated to construction demand and heavily influenced by the Brazilian economic cycle.
 
Distribution
 
We have not had material issues or bottlenecks with distribution of our products.
 
 Competition
 
 Diamonds, gold, and sand production are difficult fields to penetrate due to limited availability of new resource areas, and heavy regulatory and licensing requirements, including long wait times for permitting.
 
Our competitive position among suppliers of diamonds and gold is particularly strong because both MDB and RST are known companies in the Brazilian diamond trade and have the necessary mining and environmental licenses in place. Therefore, our products are able to be purchased openly and without restrictions since all of the supporting proof of provenance is available and in good order. Other producers that lack rights or licenses do not enjoy our position and can only sell into the "black market," possibly at a substantial discount and facing legal risks.


A secondary reason for our strong competitive position is that the diamonds from the Jequitinhonha River valley are known in Brazil and in global diamond centers to be of high quality. Since our sources of diamonds are secondary valley deposits, it is presumed that the primary kimberlitic source of such diamonds suffered erosion by the river for millions of years. In this lengthy process, over millions of years, smaller, but well proportioned, "hardy" gems resulted. These rough diamonds are easily cut and polished, and yield attractive polished diamonds. We do not treat any of our polished diamonds with laser or other methods.

 We have very little competition from other sand providers as simply there are no licensed sand mines in a large radius around our location.
 
We do face competition with respect to mortar. In the local market in which we operate, one finds a few local mortar brands, with high name recognition, and low cost.
 
Seasonality
 
  Our ability to mine for diamonds, gold and sand is highly seasonal. The rainy season normally lasts from December through April. We therefore expect that during these months our revenues will be substantially lower than during other periods.
Raw Materials
  
We do not have material dependence on any raw material or raw material supplier. The raw materials needed are available from numerous suppliers and at market-driven prices.
Intellectual Property
  
We have secured the right to use the name "Hercules" for our mortar with the Brazilian intellectual property agency. We have developed proprietary formulations for three different types of mortar that we sell.
Government Regulation 
  
The Brazilian mining industry is highly regulated. We spend a considerable amount of time preparing filings requested by the mining and the environmental regulatory agencies. Review of fillings by these agencies is deliberate and may take months or years. We comply with Brazilian federal, state, and municipal regulations. There is no governmental control of the selling of our diamonds (whether rough or polished), gold, sand, and mortar.
Mining Regulation and Compliance


Mining regulation in Brazil is carried out by the mining department, a federal entity. Each state in Brazil has a state-level office of this federal entity. For each mineral right that we own, we file any paperwork related to it in the office of the mining department in the state in which such mineral right is located. Fillings are mostly paper-based.
 
We follow the status of our various mineral rights by frequent monitoring of the mining department's online "Cadastro Mineiro" and by periodically securing physical access to paper-based documentation held at the state-level office of the mining department, and for which an appointment and power of attorney is necessary. We maintain a good relationship with the mining department and believe that our methods of monitoring are adequate for our current needs.
 
The mining department normally inspects our operations once a year via an unannounced visit which is their standard practice.  We estimate that it costs $25,000 annually to currently maintain compliance with various mining regulations.
  
Environmental Regulation and Compliance
 
 Environmental regulation in Brazil is carried out by a state-level agency, which may have multiple offices, one for each region of the state. For each mineral right that we own, we file any paperwork related to it in the local office of the environmental agency that has the applicable geographical jurisdiction. Fillings are mostly paper-based.

 We follow the status of any processes with the environmental agency by periodic visitation to such office. We maintain a good relationship with the offices of the environmental agency and believe that our methods of monitoring are adequate for our current needs.
 
The environmental agency normally inspects our operations once every one or two years which is standard practice for companies in good standing. We believe that we properly comply with the environmental laws in our applicable jurisdictions. We estimate that it costs $25,000 annually to currently maintain compliance with various environmental regulations.
 
Surface disturbance from open pit mining at MDB is incompliance with its mining plan. Furthermore, MDB regularly recuperates areas that have been exploited. The current environmental regulations state that after all mining has ceased at MDB (however long that may take), there would still be five years of available time for any necessary recuperation to be performed. The separation process for diamonds and gold at MDB does not use any cyanide or mercury. Tests are conducted regularly and there are no records of groundwater contamination.
 
Export Regulation
 
The export of rough diamonds from Brazil complies with the United Nations Kimberley Process certification system of which Brazil is a signatory country. This system was implemented by a large number of member countries of the United Nations to marginalize and prevent entrance to the diamond marketplace of those gems produced in areas where human exploitation and other specific illicit activities exist. To our knowledge, Brazil was never a jurisdiction that had any issues of these types.
 
Two of our subsidiaries have been granted export licenses, and therefore we can export either rough or polished diamonds. Gold is heavy and is best sold locally, since its price is essentially the same as abroad. There is no cost to maintain the export license active.
 
Employees and Independent Contractors
 
 As of June 1, 2017, we had 6 full-time equivalent employees, and 3 part-time persons who are independent contractors. We also periodically retain consultants to provide specific services deemed necessary. We consider our employee relations to be very good.

 
Form & Year of Organization & History to Date
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 15, 2011. From inception until December 2012, we were focused in the software business, which generated minimal revenues and was discontinued when the current management team and business focus began. We changed name to Brazil Minerals, Inc. in December 2012 to reflect the new business focus.
