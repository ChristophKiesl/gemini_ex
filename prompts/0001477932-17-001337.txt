Description of Business
 
We are a development-stage company focusing on the acquisition, research, development and, if warranted, commercialization of autologous (using a patient’s own cells) cellular therapies that can be used for medical and aesthetic applications. On July 12, 2013, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, RenovaCare Sciences Corp., completed the acquisition of our flagship technologies (collectively, the “CellMistTM System”) along with the associated United States patent applications and two foreign patents, the first of which expires on August 22, 2027 and the second of which expires on April 26, 2031. One of the two US patent applications was granted to us on November 29, 2016 (Patent No.: US 9,505,000) and expires on or about March 3, 2035. The CellMistTM System is comprised of (a) a treatment methodology for cell isolation for the regeneration of human skin cells (the “CellMistTM Solution”) and (b) a solution sprayer device (the “SkinGunTM”) for delivering the cells to the treatment area. Based on these technologies we have recently filed two additional patent applications, one with the United States Patent and Trademark Office titled “Modular Device for Cell Spraying,” and one with the European Patent Office titled “Disposable Apparatus and Device with Unsterile Reusable Apparatus for Sterile Application of a Liquid.” We effected the acquisition of the CellMistTM System through an asset purchase agreement with Dr. Jorg Gerlach, MD, PhD (the “APA”). Pursuant to the terms of the APA, as amended on September 9, 2014, we paid Dr. Gerlach an initial sum of $100,000 and are obligated to pay him an additional $300,000 in four installments: (a) $100,000 on December 31, 2014; (b) $50,000 on December 31, 2015; (c) $50,000 on December 31, 2016; and (d) $100,000 on December 31, 2017. Additionally, we issued to Dr. Gerlach a Series A Warrant allowing him to purchase up to 1,200,000 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $0.35 per share through July 12, 2019; the warrant vests in five equal annual installments.
 
The average adult human has a skin surface area of between 16 - 21 square feet, which protects all other organs against the external environment. When a person’s skin is assailed by trauma or exposed to extreme heat, the skin's various layers may be destroyed and, depending on the severity of the injury, might cause life-threatening conditions. Currently, severe trauma to the skin, such as second or third degree burns, requires surgical mesh-grafting of skin, whereby healthy skin is removed from one area of the patient's body (a “donor site”) and implanted on the damaged area. While mesh grafting is often the method of choice, we believe there are significant deficiencies with this method. The surgical procedure to remove healthy skin from the donor site can be painful and leaves the patient with a new wound that must also be attended to. In many instances the aesthetic results are not satisfying, as the color of the skin from the donor site may not match the skin color of the damaged skin. Additionally, since the ratio between the size of the wound area and the size of the donor site is quite low, i.e. the size of the skin removed must be substantially equal in size to the size of the damaged skin, the mesh-grafting approach is in many cases limited. Donor and injury sites can take weeks to heal, requiring expensive hospital stays, ongoing wound dressing management, and ever-changing anti-infection strategies. We are currently evaluating the efficacy and potential of our SkinGunTM, in combination with our CellMist™ Solution, in the treatment of tissue that has been subject to severe trauma such as second and third degree burns. In small scale clinical trials, the CellMistTM System has shown the ability to regenerate a more natural and thicker skin. The CellMistTM System utilizes the patient’s own skin stem cells and is able to address much larger treatment areas and at the same time reduce the size of the donor site. Furthermore, we believe the CellMistTM System enables the effective treatment of other skin disorders with minimal scarring compared to skin grafting.

In a clinical study of 19 patients with deep dermal wound burns to the face and neck conducted in Berlin, Germany prior to our purchase of the CellMist™ System, researchers stated that, “careful surgical debridement and consecutive application of CEA [cultured epithelial auto graft] suspensions using a spray technique results in excellent cosmetic outcomes compared with any other method.” The same researchers concluded that, “We refuse to perform a prospective randomized study with groups in which traditional skin grafting and/or wound healing are still applied for the therapy for deep dermal burns due to the excellent results in our study. The method of CEA spray application has become our standard of care for these indications. The faster wound closure, the promotion of spontaneous wound healing by keratinocyte application, as well as the preservation of donor sites are further advantages of the method.” (Hartmann MD, Bernd, et al, “Sprayed Cultured Epithelial Autografts for Deep Dermal Burns of the Face and Neck” Annals of Plastic Surgery, 58.1(2007): 70-73. Print. emphasis added). The CEA spray application used by the researchers in the publication refers to earlier iterations of what is now CellMistTM System. Dr. Gerlach, from whom we purchased the CellMistTM System, assisted in the study.
 
The development of our CellMist™ System is in the early stage and we anticipate that we will be required to expend significant time and resources to further develop our technology and determine whether a commercially viable product can be developed. Research and development of new technologies involves a high degree of risk and there is no assurance that our development activities will result in a commercially viable product. The long-term profitability of our operations will be, in part, directly related to the cost and success of our development programs, which may be affected by a number of factors.
 
Strategy
 
Our ultimate goal is to leverage the potential of our CellMist™ System as cutting edge treatments in skin therapy. Before we can do so, however, there are a number of steps we must first take, including:

· | initiating a series of clinical trials to determine the CellMist™ System's efficacy for treating wounds and burns;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | formalizing collaborations with universities and scientific partners; 
· | creating a network of clinical and research partners; and 
· | achieving Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") and other regulatory approval. 

 
Additionally, we will likely be required to raise significant capital in order to fund our ongoing research and development operations, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to raise such capital on acceptable terms, if at all.
 
Governmental Regulations
 
Domestic Regulation
 
Governmental authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, packaging, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products or devices such as those we are attempting to develop. Our device candidates, to the extent they are developed, will likely be subject to pre-market approval by the FDA prior to their marketing for commercial use in the U.S., and to any approvals required by foreign governmental entities prior to their marketing outside the U.S. In addition, any changes or modifications to a device that has received regulatory clearance or approval that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or would constitute a major change in its intended use, and may require the submission of a new application in the U.S. for pre-market approval, or for foreign regulatory approvals outside the U.S.. The process of obtaining foreign approvals, can be expensive, time consuming and uncertain. We may be required to file for premarket approval (“PMA”) for the SkinGunTMor any other device that we commercialize if it is deemed a Class III medical device. PMA is the FDA process of scientific and regulatory review to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class III medical devices. Class III devices are those that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. Due to the level of risk associated with Class III devices, the FDA has determined that general and special controls alone are insufficient to assure the safety and effectiveness of class III devices. Therefore, these devices require a PMA application under section 515 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in order to obtain marketing clearance.

PMA is the most stringent type of device marketing application required by the FDA. The applicant must receive FDA approval of its PMA application prior to marketing the device. PMA approval is based on a determination by FDA that the PMA contains sufficient valid scientific evidence to assure that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). An approved PMA is, in effect, a private license granting the applicant (or owner) permission to market the device.
 
Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”)
 
Among the data required in a PMA application is human clinical test data. The FDA’s regulation that governs the human testing is the IDE and other patient protection regulations. For devices that are considered Significant Risk, an IDE application is required. It consists of the proposed clinical protocol and all supporting study documentation and must be submitted and approved by FDA and an Institutional Review Board (IRB) prior to initiation of the human testing. Since the CellMistTM System employs the use of stem cells taken from the patient, it is considered Significant Risk by the FDA; therefore, we will be required to file an IDE application prior to conducting a clinical study for any application, such as for treatment of severe burns. The FDA has a specified review timeline and process for IDE reviews - each review phase takes 30 days and if the FDA has questions or concerns about the study design, there may be multiple review rounds until FDA either: (a) conditionally approves, (b) approves or (c) denies approval of the clinical study conduct under the submitted IDE. There is no guarantee that any IDE application we submit will be approved by the FDA.
 
HIPAA Requirements
 
Other federal legislation may affect our ability to obtain certain health information in conjunction with any research activities we conduct. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), mandates, among other things, the adoption of standards designed to safeguard the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information. In relevant part, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), has released two rules to date mandating the use of new standards with respect to such health information. The first rule imposes new standards relating to the privacy of individually identifiable health information. These standards restrict the manner and circumstances under which covered entities may use and disclose protected health information so as to protect the privacy of that information. The second rule released by HHS establishes minimum standards for the security of electronic health information. While we do not believe we are directly regulated as a covered entity under HIPAA, the HIPAA standards impose requirements on covered entities conducting research activities regarding the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information collected in the course of conducting the research. 
 
Other U.S. Regulatory Requirements
 
In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale, and promotion of drug and biological products are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly the Health Care Financing Administration), other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the False Claims Act, and similar state laws, each as amended. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, each as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection, unfair competition, and other laws.

International Regulation
 
The regulation of any potential product candidates we may produce outside of the United States varies by country. Certain countries regulate human tissue products as a pharmaceutical product, which would require us to make extensive filings and obtain regulatory approvals before selling our product candidates. Certain other countries may classify our product candidates as human tissue for transplantation but may restrict its import or sale. Other countries have no application regulations regarding the import or sale of products similar to potential product candidates, creating uncertainty as to what standards we may be required to meet.
Competition
 
The pharmaceutical and wound care industries are characterized by intense competition, rapid product development and technological change. Our CellMistTM System competes with a variety of companies in the wound care markets, many of which offer substantially different treatments for similar problems. Currently Avita Medical Limited is evaluating the efficacy of ReCell®, a cell spray device and a cell isolation procedure for autologous cells. Integra Lifesciences Holding Corp. sells Integra® Dermal Regeneration Template, which does not use autologous cells, but instead uses an animal-derived intercellular matrix with an artificial waterproof barrier. Other competitors include: MiMedx Group, Inc.; Acelity L.P. Inc.; Fibrocell Science, Inc.; Shire Plc and Organogenesis, Inc.
 
Many of our competitors are large, well-established pharmaceutical, chemical, cosmetic or health care companies with considerably greater financial, marketing, sales and technical resources than those available to us. Additionally, many of our present and potential competitors have research and development capabilities that may allow them to develop new or improved products that may compete with our product lines. Our potential products could be rendered obsolete or made uneconomical by the development of new products to treat the conditions addressed by our products, technological advances affecting the cost of production, or marketing or pricing actions by one or more of our competitors.
 
Strategy
 
Our ultimate goal is to leverage the potential of our CellMistTM System as cutting edge treatments in skin therapy. Before we can do so, however, there are a number of steps we must first take, including:
 
 
· | initiating a series of clinical trials to determine the CellMistTM System’s efficacy for treating wounds and burns;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | expanding the range of possible applications; 
· | formalizing collaborations with universities and scientific partners; 
· | creating a network of clinical and research partners; and 
· | achieving Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) and other regulatory clearance/approval. 

  
Additionally, we will likely be required to raise significant capital in order to fund our ongoing research and development operations, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to raise on acceptable terms, if at all.
 
Operations
 
We expect to be engaged in research and development activities for the foreseeable future.
 
Employees
 
We currently have one full time employee, Mr. Andrew Danielson, Director of Operations, and three part-time contractors: Mr. Thomas Bold, President and Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer; Ms. Patsy Trisler, Vice-President Clinical & Regulatory Affairs; and Dr. Roger Esteban-Vives, Director of Cell Sciences.
