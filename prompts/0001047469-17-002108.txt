     ITEM 1.    BUSINESS 
  General 
         We are the largest global network of degree-granting higher education institutions, with more than one million students enrolled at our 70 institutions in 25 countries on more than 200 campuses, which we collectively refer to as the Laureate International Universities network. We participate in the global higher education market, which was estimated to account for revenues of approximately $1.5 trillion in 2015, according to GSV Advisors ("GSV"). We believe the global higher education market presents an attractive long-term opportunity, primarily because of the large and growing imbalance between the supply and demand for quality higher education around the world. Advanced education opportunities drive higher earnings potential, and we believe the projected growth in the middle class population worldwide and limited government resources dedicated to higher education create substantial opportunities for high-quality private institutions to meet this growing and unmet demand. Our outcomes-driven strategy is focused on enabling millions of students globally to prosper and thrive in the dynamic and evolving knowledge economy. 
         In 1999, we made our first investment in higher education and, since that time, we have developed into the global leader in higher education, based on the number of students, institutions and countries making up our network. Our global network of 70 institutions comprises 58 institutions we own or control, and an additional 12 institutions that we manage or with which we have other relationships. Our institutions are recognized for their high-quality academics. For example, we own and operate Universidad del Valle de México ("UVM Mexico"), the largest private university in Mexico, which in 2016 was ranked seventh among all public and private higher education institutions in the country by Guía Universitaria, an annual publication of Reader's Digest. Our track record for delivering high-quality outcomes to our students, while stressing affordability and accessibility, has been a key reason for our long record of success, including 16 consecutive years of enrollment growth. We have generated compound annual growth rates ("CAGRs") in total enrollment and revenues of 9.9% and 8.7%, respectively, from 2009 through December 31, 2016. 
         Since being taken private in August 2007, we have undertaken several initiatives to continually improve the quality of our programs and outcomes for our students, while expanding our scale and geographic presence, and strengthening our organization and management team. From 2007 to December 31, 2016, we have expanded into 12 new countries, added over 100 campuses worldwide and grown enrollment from approximately 300,000 to more than one million students with a combination of strong organic revenue growth of 8.5% (average annual revenue growth from 2007 to 2016 excluding acquisitions and dispositions) and the successful integration of 41 strategic acquisitions. Key to this growth were expansions into Brazil, where we owned 13 institutions with a combined enrollment of approximately 259,000 students, and expansions into Asia, the Middle East and Africa, where we owned or controlled 21 institutions with a combined enrollment of approximately 85,700 students. Further, we have made significant capital investments and continue to make operational improvements in technology and human resources, including key management hires, and are developing scalable back-office operations to support the Laureate International Universities network, including implementing a vertically integrated information technology, finance, accounting and human resources organization that, among other things, are designed to enhance our analytical capabilities. Finally, over the past several years, we have invested heavily in technology-enabled solutions to enhance the student experience, increase penetration of our hybrid offerings and optimize efficiency throughout our network. We believe these investments have created an intellectual property advantage that has further differentiated our offerings from local market competitors. 
         The  Laureate International Universities network enables us to educate our students locally, while connecting them to an international community with a global perspective. Our students can take 
 5

   advantage of shared curricula, optional international programs and services, including English language instruction, dual-degree and study abroad programs and other benefits offered by other institutions in our network. We believe that the benefits of the network translate into better career opportunities and higher earnings potential for our graduates. 
         The institutions in the Laureate International Universities network offer a broad range of undergraduate and graduate degrees through campus-based, online and hybrid programs. Approximately 93% of our students attend traditional, campus-based institutions offering multi-year degrees, similar to leading private and public higher education institutions in the United States and Europe. In addition, approximately two thirds of our students are enrolled in programs of four or more years in duration. Our programs are designed with a distinct emphasis on applied, professional-oriented content for growing career fields and are focused on specific academic disciplines, or verticals, that we believe demonstrate strong employment opportunities and provide high earnings potential for our students, including: 
 
        Across these academic disciplines, we continually and proactively adapt our curriculum to the needs of the market, including emphasizing the core STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) and business disciplines. We believe the STEM and business disciplines present attractive areas of study to students, especially in developing countries where there exists a strong and ongoing focus to develop and retain professionally trained individuals. Since 2009, we have more than doubled our enrollment of students pursuing degrees in Business & Management, Medicine & Health Sciences and Engineering & Information Technology, our three largest disciplines. We believe the work of our graduates in these disciplines creates a positive impact on the communities we serve and strengthens our institutions' reputations within their respective markets. 
         Across the world, we operate institutions that address regional, national and local supply and demand imbalances in higher education. As the global leader in higher education, we believe we are uniquely positioned to effectively deliver high-quality education across different brands and tuition levels in the markets in which we operate. In many developing markets, traditional higher education students (defined as 18-24 year olds) have historically been served by public universities, which have limited capacity and are often underfunded, resulting in an inability to meet growing student demands and employer requirements. Our institutions in these markets offer traditional higher education students a private education alternative, often with multiple brands and price points in each market, with innovative programs and strong career-driven outcomes. In many of these same markets, non-traditional students such as working adults and distance learners have limited options for pursuing higher education. Through targeted programs and multiple teaching modalities, we are able to serve the differentiated needs of this unique demographic. Our flexible approach across geographies allows Laureate to access a broader addressable market of students by efficiently tailoring institutions to meet the needs of a particular geography and student population. 
         We have four reporting segments, which are summarized in the table below. We group our institutions by geography in Latin America ("LatAm"), Europe ("Europe") and Asia, Middle East and 
 6

   Africa ("AMEA") for reporting purposes. Our Global Products and Services ("GPS") segment includes our fully online universities and our campus-based institutions in the United States.

  Our Industry 
         We are the leader in the global market for higher education, which is characterized by a significant imbalance between supply and demand, especially in developing economies. In many countries, demand for higher education is large and growing. GSV estimates that higher education institutions accounted for total revenues of approximately $1.5 trillion globally in 2015, with the higher education market expected to grow by approximately 5% per annum through 2020. Global growth in higher education is being fueled by several demographic and economic factors, including a growing middle class, global growth in services and technology-related industries and recognition of the significant personal and economic benefits gained by graduates of higher education institutions. At the same time, many governments have limited resources to devote to higher education, resulting in a diminished ability by the public sector to meet growing demand, and creating opportunities for private education providers 
 7

   to enter these markets and deliver high-quality education. As a result, the private sector plays a large and growing role in higher education globally. While the Laureate International Universities network is the largest global network of degree-granting higher education institutions in the world, our total enrollment of more than one million students represents only 0.5% of worldwide higher education students. 
  Large, Growing and Underpenetrated Population of Qualified Higher Education Students.    According to United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ("UNESCO"), 207.5 million students worldwide were enrolled in higher education institutions in 2014, more than double the 99.7 million students enrolled in 2000, and approximately 90% of those students were enrolled at institutions outside of the United States as of 2013. In many countries, including throughout Latin America, Asia and other developing regions, there is growing demand for higher education based on favorable demographics, increasing secondary completion rates and increasing higher education participation rates, resulting in continued growth in higher education enrollments. While global participation rates have increased for traditional higher education students (defined as 18-24 year olds), the market for higher education is still significantly underpenetrated, particularly in developing countries. Given the low penetration rates, many governments in developing countries have a stated goal of increasing the number of students participating in higher education. For example, Mexico's participation rate increased from approximately 16% to approximately 23% from 2003 to 2014, and the Mexican government has set a goal of increasing the number of students enrolled in higher education by 17% over the next three years. Other developing countries with large addressable markets are similarly underpenetrated as evidenced by the following participation rates for 2014: Saudi Arabia 40%, Brazil 35%, China 28% and India 20%, all of which are well below rates of developed countries such as the United States and Spain, which in 2013 had participation rates of approximately 63% and approximately 61%, respectively. 
  Strong Economic Incentives for Higher Education.    According to the Brookings Institution, approximately 3.2 billion people in the world composed the middle class in 2016, a number that is expected to be over five billion people by 2028. We believe that members of this large and growing group seek advanced education opportunities for themselves and their children in recognition of the vast differential in earnings potential with and without higher education. According to data from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD"), in certain European markets in which we operate, the earnings from employment for an adult completing higher education were approximately 55% higher than those of an adult with just an upper secondary education, while in the United States the differential was approximately 68%. This income gap is even more pronounced in many developing countries around the world, including a differential of approximately 139% in Chile and approximately 141% in Brazil. OECD statistics also show that overall employment rates are greater for individuals completing higher education than for those who have not completed upper secondary education. In addition, we believe as economies around the world are increasingly based on the services sector, they will require significant investment in human capital, advanced education and specialized training to produce knowledgeable professionals. We believe the cumulative impact of favorable demographic and socio-economic trends, coupled with the superior earnings potential of higher education graduates, will continue to expand the market for private higher education. 
  Increasing Role of the Private Sector in Higher Education.    In many of our markets, the private sector plays a meaningful role in higher education, bridging supply and demand imbalances created by a lack of capacity at public universities. In addition to capacity limitations, we believe that limited public resources, and the corresponding policy reforms to make higher education systems less dependent on the financial and operational support of local governments, have resulted in increased enrollments in private institutions relative to public institutions. 
 8

           According to the OECD, from 2003 to 2013, the number of students enrolled in private institutions grew from approximately 26% to approximately 31% of total enrollments within OECD countries. For example, Brazil and Chile rely heavily upon private institutions to deliver quality higher education to students, with approximately 71% (in 2012) and approximately 84% (in 2013), respectively, of higher education students in these countries enrolled in private institutions. 
         The decrease in government funding to public higher education institutions in recent years has served to spur the growth of private institutions, as tuitions have been increasingly funded by private sources. On average, OECD countries experienced a decrease in public funding from approximately 69% of total funding in 2000 to approximately 65% in 2012. For example, Mexico experienced a decrease in public funding as a percentage of total funding of approximately ten percentage points during the same period. We believe these trends have increased demand for competitive private institutions as public institutions are unable to meet the demand of students and families around the world, especially in developing markets. 
  Greater Accessibility to Higher Education through Online and Hybrid Offerings.    Improving Internet broadband infrastructure and new instruction methodologies designed for the online medium have driven increased acceptance of the online modality globally. According to a survey conducted by the Babson Survey Research Group, approximately 71% of academic leaders rated online learning outcomes as the same or superior to classroom learning in 2014, up from approximately 57% in 2003. GSV estimates that the online higher education market will grow by a CAGR of approximately 25%, from $49 billion in 2012 to $149 billion in 2017. Additionally, new online and hybrid education offerings have enabled the cost-effective delivery of higher education, while improving overall affordability and accessibility for students. We believe that increasing student demand, coupled with growing employer and regulatory acceptance of degrees obtained through online and hybrid modalities, will continue to drive significant growth in the online and hybrid higher education market globally. 
   Our Strengths and Competitive Advantages 
         We believe our key competitive strengths that will enable us to execute our growth strategy include the following: 
  First Mover and Leader in Global Higher Education.    In 1999, we made our first investment in global higher education. Since that time, the  Laureate International Universities network has grown to include 70 institutions in 25 countries that enroll more than one million students, of which approximately 95% are outside of the United States and over 85% reside in developing countries. Our growth has been the result of numerous organic initiatives, supplemented by successfully completing and integrating 41 acquisitions since August 2007, substantially all of which were completed through private negotiations and not as part of an auction process. Given our size and status as the first mover in many of our markets, we have been able to acquire many marquee assets, which we believe will help us maintain our market-leading position due to the considerable time and expense it would take a competitor to establish an integrated network of international universities of similar scale with the brands, intellectual property and accreditations that we possess. 
  Long-Standing and Reputable University Brands Delivering High Quality Education.    We believe we have established a reputation for providing high-quality higher education around the world, and that our schools are among the most respected higher education brands in their local markets. Many of our institutions have over 50-year histories. In addition to long-standing presences in their local communities, many of our institutions are ranked among the best in their respective countries. For example, the  Barómetro de la Educación Superior has ranked Universidad Andrés Bello as the top private university in Chile. Similarly, in Brazil, Universidade Anhembi Morumbi is ranked by Guia do Estudante as one of São Paulo's top universities, and in Europe, Universidad Europea de Madrid is the second largest private university in Spain and received four stars in the prestigious 2015 QS StarsTM
9

   international university rating. Our U.S.-based institutions have been recognized for their quality and value. Walden University, a member of the Laureate International Universities network, was singled out in the U.S. Senate Report on For Profit Higher Education in 2012 as "perhaps the best of any company examined." More recently, Walden ranked 19th on the list of the top 100 universities for adult learners in the Washington Monthly 2016 College Rankings. 
         Our strong brands are perpetuated by our student-centric focus and our mission to provide greater access to cost-effective, high-quality higher education, which allows more students to pursue their academic and career aspirations. We are committed to continually evaluating our institutions to ensure we are providing the highest quality education to our students. Our proprietary management tool, the Laureate Education Assessment Framework ("LEAF"), is used to evaluate institutional performance based on 44 unique criteria across five different categories: Employability, Learning Experience, Personal Experience, Access & Outreach and Academic Excellence. LEAF, in conjunction with additional external assessment methodologies, such as QS StarsTM, allows us to identify key areas for improvement in order to drive a culture of quality and continual innovation at our institutions. For example, more than 81% of students attending Laureate institutions in Brazil are enrolled in an institution with an IGC score (an indicator used by the Brazilian Ministry of Education ("MEC") to evaluate the quality of higher education institutions) that has improved since 2010. In addition, our Brazilian institutions' IGC scores have increased by more than 22% on average from 2010 to 2015, placing three of our institutions in the top quarter, and all of our institutions are ranked in the top half of all private higher education institutions in the country. 
         Many of our institutions and programs have earned the highest accreditation available, which provides us with a strong competitive advantage in local markets. For example, we serve more than 200,000 students in the fields of medicine and health sciences on over 100 campuses throughout the Laureate International Universities network, including 22 medical schools and 19 dental schools. Medical school licenses are often the most difficult to obtain and are only granted to institutions that meet rigorous standards. We believe the existence of medical schools at many of our institutions further validates the quality of our institutions and programs. Similarly, other institutions have received numerous specialized accreditations, including those for Ph.D. programs. For example, UNAB, UDLA Ecuador, and UPC are three of only 11 universities in all of Latin America to receive a U.S. accreditation, which is highly regarded and difficult to attain. Finally, in addition to Universidad Europea de Madrid, 14 institutions in our network were also rated by QS Stars international university rating, which is a prestigious external assessment. In 2015, many Laureate institutions received three and four stars as indicated below:

         Superior Outcomes for Our Students.    We offer high-quality undergraduate, graduate and specialized programs in a wide range of disciplines that generate strong interest from students and provide attractive employment prospects. We design our programs to prepare students to contribute productively in their chosen professions upon employment. Our curriculum development process includes employer surveys and ongoing research into business trends to determine the skills and knowledge base that will be required by those employers in the future. This information results in timely curriculum upgrades, which helps ensure that our graduates acquire the skills that will make them marketable to employers. In 2014, we commissioned a study by Millward Brown, a leading third-party market research organization, of graduates at Laureate institutions representing over 60% of total Laureate enrollments. Graduates at 12 of our 13 surveyed international institutions achieved, on average, equal or higher employment rates within 12 months of graduation as compared to graduates of other institutions in the same markets, and in all of our premium institutions surveyed, graduates achieved higher starting salaries as compared to graduates of other institutions in those same markets (salary premium to market benchmarks ranged from approximately 6% to approximately 118%). In addition, a joint study by Laureate and the IFC/World Bank Group in 2014 showed that graduates of Laureate institutions in Mexico experienced higher rates of social mobility, finding jobs and moving up in socioeconomic status than their peers in non-Laureate institutions. In 2016, we conducted a similar study with the IFC in Peru for two of our network institutions, Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas and Cibertec, which showed that graduates from the larger programs of both institutions had higher salaries than their control group counterparts. Additionally, graduates from UPC were found to experience a larger positive change in their socioeconomic status than their peers who completed studies at non-Laureate institutions. 
         In 2016, Walden University commissioned Gallup to conduct a survey of Walden University's graduate-degree alumni using its Gallup-Purdue Index. The survey explored the relationship between Walden University's graduates' experiences and long-term outcomes based on their responses. Gallup administered a custom survey, developed in partnership with Walden University, to Walden University graduate degree holders and a national sample of graduate degree holders to allow comparison of outcomes in the areas of professional success, return on investment and civic engagement. The study included 8,677 adults who received graduate degrees from Walden University between 1990 and 2015 as well as 6,687 graduates from the national sample. Within the national sample, Gallup created an additional comparison group of graduates who completed half or more of their graduate degree online, the "half-plus graduate alumni," more closely resembling the Walden University sample set of online alumni. The Walden University sample is more likely than the half-plus online graduate alumni sample to be female (76% vs. 60%) and from a racial or ethnic minority group (36% vs. 28%), and the Walden University alumni are more likely than half-plus online graduate alumni to be the first generation in their families to attend college (61% vs. 48%). As evidenced by the demographic distinctions, Walden University graduates reflect a more diverse population compared with both national comparison groups. The survey results illustrate how many Walden University graduates went on to advance their careers, including that Walden University graduates were more likely than comparison groups to cite their degree as being important or very important toward getting promoted, achieving a salary raise and changing careers. The Gallup survey states that half-plus online graduate alumni are more likely than 
 11

   Walden University alumni to have degrees in well-compensated professions, including those with degrees in business and management (20% half-plus graduate alumni vs. 12% for Walden University alumni) and engineering (5% half-plus graduate alumni vs. 0% for Walden University alumni). Conversely, Walden University alumni are predominantly in professions that typically earn less: education (23% half-plus graduate alumni vs. 29% for Walden University alumni), teaching (8% half-plus graduate alumni vs. 14% for Walden University alumni) and nursing (6% half-plus graduate alumni vs. 24% for Walden University alumni). According to Gallup's survey, career advancement following receipt of a Walden University graduate degree may be contributing to the vast majority of Walden University graduates (88%) saying they are satisfied with their personal life today, on par with half-plus online graduate alumni (86%) and graduate degree holders nationally (89%). Additionally, 83% of Walden University graduates agree or strongly agree that they were challenged academically by Walden University, higher than the 75% of half-plus online graduate alumni surveyed but similar to graduate degree holders nationally (83%). 
  Robust Technology and Intellectual Property Platform.    By virtue of our 17 years of experience operating in a global environment, managing campus-based institutions across multiple disciplines and developing and administering online programs and curricula, we have developed an extensive collection of intellectual property. We believe this collection of intellectual property, which includes online capabilities, campus design and management, recruitment of transnational students, faculty training, curriculum design and quality assurance, among other proprietary solutions, provides our students a truly differentiated learning experience and creates a significant competitive advantage for our institutions over competitors. 
         A critical element of our intellectual property is a suite of proprietary technology solutions. Select examples include OneCampus, which connects students across our network with shared online courses and digital experiences, and Slingshot, an online career orientation tool that enables students to explore career paths through state-of-the-art interest assessment and rich content about hundreds of careers. Our commitment to investing in technology infrastructure, software and human capital ensures a high-quality educational experience for our students and faculty, while also providing us with the infrastructure to manage and scale our business. 
         Our intellectual property has been a key driver in developing partnerships with prestigious independent institutions and governments globally. For example, we have partnered with other traditional public and private higher education institutions as a provider of online services. We have operated this model for more than ten years with the University of Liverpool in the United Kingdom and, more recently, we have added new partnerships with the University of Roehampton in the United Kingdom and the University of Miami in the United States. Additionally, in 2013, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia launched the College of Excellence program with a long-term goal of opening 100 new technical colleges, and sought private operators to manage the institutions on its behalf under an operating model in which the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia funds the capital requirements to build the institutions, and the private operator runs the academic operations under a contract model. As of December 31, 2016, we have been awarded contracts to operate eight of the 33 colleges for which contracts have been awarded to date, more than any other provider in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 
         Scale and Diversification of Our Global Network.    The Laureate International Universities network is diversified across 25 countries, 70 campus-based and online institutions and over 2,500 programs. Additionally, in many markets, we have multiple institutions serving different segments of the population, at different price points and with different academic offerings. Although the majority of our institutions serve the premium segment of the market, we also have expanded our portfolio of offerings in many markets to include high-quality value and technical-vocational institutions. By serving multiple segments of the market, all with high-quality offerings, we are able to continue to expand our enrollments during varying economic cycles. Our top five largest markets, as measured by revenue, represented 71% of our consolidated revenue and 79% of our total enrollments in 2016. Our top five largest markets are home to 15% of the world's higher education students. We believe there is no other public or private organization that commands comparable global reach or scale. 
 12

          
        Our global network allows our institutions to bring their distinctive identities together with our proprietary international content, managerial best practices and international programs. Through collaboration across the global network, we can efficiently share academic curricula and resources, create dual degree programs and student exchanges, develop our faculty and incorporate best practices throughout the organization. In addition, our wide-ranging network allows us to continue to scale our business by facilitating the expansion of existing programs and campuses, the launch of new programs, the opening of new campuses in areas of high demand and the strategic acquisition and integration of new institutions into our network. For example, the resources and support of our global network have had a demonstrated impact on our Medicine & Health Sciences expansion effort, which has resulted in enrollment growth from approximately 75,000 students in 2009 to more than 200,000 students as of December 31, 2016. Furthermore, the existing breadth of our network allows us to provide a high-quality educational experience to our students, while simultaneously accessing the broadest addressable market for our offerings. 
         In recognition of the benefits of our international scale, and in order to formalize our organizational focus on the opportunities presented by our established network, we created the Laureate Network Office ("LNO") in 2015. The LNO is an important resource that allows us, among other things, to better leverage our expertise in the online modality to increase the frequency and effectiveness of online and hybrid learning opportunities across the network. 
         To further illustrate the breadth and diversity of our global network, the charts below show the mix of our geographic revenues, programs, modality and levels of study:

     Attractive Financial Model. 
 

 Strong and Consistent Growth.  We have a proven track record of delivering
strong financial results through various economic cycles. From 2009 to 2016, our revenues and Adjusted EBITDA grew at a CAGR of 8.7% and 11.0%, respectively (9.5% and 9.9% on a constant currency
basis, respectively). From 2009 to 2016, our net income increased from a loss of $150.1 million to a profit of $366.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Adjusted for
acquisitions and dispositions, our average annual organic revenue growth over the same period was 6.8% (9.8% on a constant currency basis). For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income
(loss), see "Item 6Selected Financial Data." 
 Private Pay Model.  Approximately 75% of our revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2016 were generated from private pay sources. We believe students' and families' willingness to allocate personal resources to fund higher education at our institutions validates
our strong value proposition. 
 Revenue Visibility Enhanced by Program Length and Strong Retention.  The
majority of the academic programs offered by our institutions last between three and five years, and approximately two thirds of our students were enrolled in programs of at least four years or more
in duration, as of December 31, 2016. The length of our programs provides us with a high degree of revenue visibility, which historically has led to more predictable financial results. Given
that our fall student intake is substantially completed by the end of September, we have visibility into approximately 70% of the following year's revenues, assuming a constant foreign exchange
environment and assuming retention and graduation rates in line with historical performance. We actively monitor and manage student retention because of the impact it has on student outcomes and our
financial results. The historical annual student retention rate, which we define as the proportion of prior year students returning in the current year (excluding graduating students), of over 80% has
not varied by more than two percentage points in any one year over the last five years. Given our high degree of revenue visibility, we are able to make attractive capital investments and execute
other strategic initiatives to help drive sustainable growth in our business. 
 Attractive Return on Incremental Invested Capital ("ROIIC").  Our capital
investments since inception have created significant scale and have also laid the foundation for continued strong organic growth. Given that we have already made foundational infrastructure
investments in many of our core markets, we expect to recognize attractive returns on incremental invested capital deployed. As of December 31, 2015, our four-year ROIIC was 28.1%. For more
information on ROIIC, see "Item 6Selected Financial Data." 

  Proven Management Team.    We have an experienced and talented senior management team, with strong international expertise from a wide variety of industry-leading global companies. Our executive officers have been with us an average of 14 years and have led our transformation into the largest global network of degree-granting higher education institutions in the world. Douglas L. Becker, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and founder, has led our Company since its inception in 1989 and has cultivated an entrepreneurial and collaborative management culture. This entrepreneurial leadership style has been complemented by an executive management team with broad global experience, enabling us to institute strong governance practices throughout our network. The strength of the management team has enabled the sharing of best practices, allowing us to capitalize on favorable market dynamics and leading to the successful integration of numerous institutions into the Laureate International Universities network. In addition, we have strong regional and local management teams with a deep understanding of the local markets, that are focused on meeting the needs of our students and communities, and maintaining key relationships with regulators and business leaders. Our 
 14

   management team has a proven track record of gaining the trust and respect of the many regulatory authorities that are critical to our business.

         We intend to continue to focus on growing the Laureate International Universities network through the following key strategies: 
         Expand Programs, Demographics and Capacity.    We will continue to focus on opportunities to expand our programs and the type of students that we serve, as well as our capacity in our markets to meet local demand. We also intend to continue to improve the performance of each of our institutions by adopting best practices that have been successful at other institutions in the Laureate International Universities network. We believe these initiatives will drive organic growth and provide an attractive return on capital. In particular, we intend to: 


 Add New Programs and Course Offerings.  We will continue to develop new
programs and course offerings to address the changing needs in the markets we serve by using shared curricula available through the network, and in consultation with leading local businesses. New
programs and course offerings enable us to consistently provide a high-quality education that is desired by students and prospective employers. As we optimize our offerings to deliver courses in
high-demand disciplines, we also believe we will be able to increase enrollment and improve utilization at institutions across our network. 
 Expand Target Student Demographics.  In many of our markets, we use
sophisticated analytical techniques to identify opportunities to provide quality education to new or underserved student populations where market demand is not being met, such as non-traditional
students (e.g., working adults) who may value flexible scheduling options, as well as traditional students. Our ability to provide quality education to these underserved markets has provided
additional growth to the Laureate International Universities network and we intend to leverage our management capabilities and local knowledge to
further capitalize on these higher education opportunities in new and existing markets. As we expand in a particular country or region, we often develop tailored programs to address the unmet needs of
these markets. 
 Increase Capacity at Existing and New Campus Locations.  We will continue to
make demand-driven investments in additional capacity throughout the Laureate International Universities network by expanding existing campuses and
opening new campuses, including in new cities. We employ a highly analytical process based on economic and demographic trends, and demand data for the local market to determine when and where to
expand capacity. When opening a new campus or expanding existing facilities, we use best practices that we have developed over more than the past decade to cost-effectively expedite the opening and
development of that location. 

         We have successfully implemented these strategies at many of our institutions. For example, at UVM Mexico we grew total enrollments from approximately 37,000 students in 2002 to approximately 130,000 in 2016. This growth was the result of the introduction of new programs, including in the fields of health sciences, engineering and hospitality, the addition of 23 new campus locations (from 13 in 2002 to 37 in 2016), and the ability to serve new market segments such as working adults. While UVM Mexico has grown into the largest private institution in Mexico, our relentless focus on academic quality remains. In fact, UVM Mexico has improved from the 9th ranked institution in 2004 to the 7th ranked institution in 2016 according to Guía Universitaria. Further examples of our successes in implementing these strategies include:
 

 At UPC in Peru, enrollment grew from approximately 4,000 students in 2004 to approximately 51,000 in 2016. This growth was the result of the
introduction of new programs, including in the 

 15

   

fields
of health sciences and communications, the addition of three new campus locations (from one in 2004 to four in 2016), and the ability to serve new market segments such as working adults. In
2015, UPC received three stars in the prestigious 2015 QS Stars international university rating. In 2016, UPC became the first Peruvian university accredited at the highest level by any
of the six accreditation bodies of the United States when it was accredited by the Commission on Senior Colleges of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. 


 At UAM Brazil in Brazil, enrollment grew from approximately 21,000 students in 2007 to approximately 49,000 in 2016. This growth was the result
of the introduction of new programs, including health sciences, the addition of two campus locations (from four in 2007 to six in 2016), and the ability to serve new market segments. UAM Brazil was
ranked as one of the top ten private universities in the city of São Paulo based on results from the Índice Geral de Cursos, a systematic evaluation administered by the
Brazilian Ministry of Education to judge the quality of academic degree programs, and received three stars in the prestigious 2015 QS StarsTM international university rating. 
 In Spain, at Universidad Europea de Madrid, Universidad Europea de Valencia and Universidad Europea de Canarias, enrollment grew from
approximately 6,000 students in 1999 to approximately 16,000 in 2016. This growth was the result of the introduction of new programs including in the fields of health, engineering and communications,
the addition of four campus locations (from two in 1999 to six in 2016), and the ability to serve new market segments such as working adults. Universidad Europea de Madrid has grown to become the
second largest private university in Spain and received four stars in the prestigious 2015 QS StarsTM international university rating. 

  Expand Penetration of Online and Hybrid Offerings.    We intend to increase the number of our students who receive their education through fully online or hybrid programs to meet the growing demand of younger generations that continue to embrace technology. Over the past decade, the global population with Internet access has continued to grow, and Forrester Research, Inc. ("Forrester") estimates a total of 3.5 billion people will have Internet access by 2017, representing nearly half of the world's population. Additionally, in many of our markets, online education is becoming more accepted by regulators and education professionals as an effective means of providing quality higher education. As the quality and acceptance of online education increases globally, we plan to continue investing in both expanding our stand-alone online course offerings and enhancing our traditional campus-based course offerings via complementary online delivery, creating a hybrid delivery model. We believe our history of success with Walden University, a fully online institution in the United States, and our well-developed online program offerings will provide a considerable advantage over local competitors, enabling us to combine our strong local brands with our experience in delivering online education. By the end of 2019, our goal is to increase the number of student credit hours taken online, which was approximately 15% as of the end of 2016, to approximately 25%. Some of our network institutions are already implementing online programs with significant progress being made. Our online initiative is designed to not only provide our students with access to the technology platforms and innovative programs they expect, but also to increase our enrollment in a more capital efficient manner, leveraging current infrastructure and improving classroom utilization. 
  Expand Presence in AMEA.    AMEA represents the largest higher education market opportunity in the world with more than 130 million students enrolled in higher education institutions in 2014, according to UNESCO. Despite the large number of students enrolled, participation rates in the region suggest significantly underpenetrated enrollment given the strong imbalance between the supply and demand for higher education. 
         In 2008, we entered the AMEA higher education market with our acquisition of an interest in INTI Education Group in Malaysia. In the last eight years, we have grown our AMEA footprint to 
 16

   include 21 institutions in eight countries, serving approximately 85,700 students, representing an enrollment CAGR of approximately 19% since entering the region in 2008. Recent expansion in the AMEA region includes eight Colleges of Excellence in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and our first institution in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2013, Monash South Africa. In anticipation of continued growth, we have made significant investments in the region, including hiring an experienced regional management team and establishing the infrastructure to help facilitate growth and further expand our footprint in the region. We plan to continue to expand our presence in AMEA by prioritizing markets based on demographic, market and regulatory factors, while seeking attractive returns on capital. 
  Accelerate Partnership and Services Model Globally.    As the global leader in higher education, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on additional opportunities in the form of partnership and service models that are designed to address the growing needs of traditional institutions and governments around the world. 
         Increasingly more complex services and operating capabilities are required by higher education institutions to address the needs of students effectively, and we believe our expertise and knowledge will allow us to leverage our intellectual property and technology to serve this market need. We have partnered with traditional public and private education institutions as a provider of online services and we believe there will be opportunities to expand that platform under similar relationships with other prestigious independent institutions in the future. Additionally, we are continually adding to our suite of solutions, and we believe many of these products and services will provide additional contractual and licensing opportunities for us in the future. For example, in recent years we have significantly advanced our digital teaching and learning efforts through proprietary technology-enabled solutions such as:
 

OneFolio, an online tool that connects Laureate faculty members, instructional designers, and
learning architects to valuable digital resources they can use to enhance the student learning experience. 
Laureate Languages, which provides digital language learning solutions to our students and
faculty in the areas of General English, Professional English and English for Academic Purposes, as well as teacher training and assessment. 

         Additionally, governments around the world are increasingly focused on increasing participation rates and often do not have an established or scalable public sector platform with the necessary expertise to accomplish that objective, and therefore are willing to fund private sector solutions. We believe our current partnership with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where we were selected as their largest partner for the Colleges of Excellence program, is a demonstration of how our distinct portfolio of solutions differentiates us from other providers who participated in the selection process. We are in active discussion with other governments regarding similar partnerships, as well as other solutions that we can provide to existing and new partners, and we anticipate this could be a source of additional revenue for us in the future. 
  Increase Operating Efficiencies through Centralization and Standardization.    In 2014, we launched EiP as an enterprise-wide initiative to optimize and standardize our processes to enable sustained growth and margin expansion. The program aims to enable vertical integration of procurement, information technology, finance, accounting and human resources, thus enabling us to fully leverage the growing size and scope of our local operations. Specifically, we have developed and begun to deploy regional SSOs around the world, which will process most back-office and non-student facing transactions for the institutions in the Laureate International Universities network, such as accounting, finance and procurement. The implementation of EiP and regional SSOs are expected to generate significant cost savings throughout the network as we eliminate redundant processes and better leverage our global scale. In addition, centralized information technology, product development and content management will allow us to propagate best practices throughout the Laureate International Universities network and capitalize on efficiencies to help improve performance. We anticipate EiP will require an investment of 
 17

   approximately $180 million from 2015 to 2017, with the first significant investments already having been made in 2015. These investments have already begun to generate cost savings and, upon completion of the project, we expect these efficiencies to generate approximately $100 million in annual cost savings in 2019, while also enhancing our internal controls and the speed of integration of new acquisitions. We also believe these initiatives will enhance the student experience by improving the quality of our operations and by enabling additional reinvestment in facilities, faculty and course offerings. 
  Target Strategic Acquisitions.    Since being taken private in August 2007, we have made 41 acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2.0 billion, including assumed debt. Substantially all of these acquisitions were completed through private negotiations and not as part of an auction process, which we believe demonstrates our standing as a partner of choice. We intend to continue to expand through the selective acquisition of institutions in new and existing markets. We employ a highly disciplined approach to acquisitions by focusing on key characteristics that make certain markets particularly attractive for private higher education, such as demographics, economic and social factors, the presence of a stable political environment and a regulatory climate that values private higher education. When we enter a new market or industry sector, we target institutions with well-regarded reputations and which are well-respected by regulators. We also invest time and resources to understand the managerial, financial and academic resources of the prospect and the resources we can bring to that institution. After an acquisition, we focus on organic growth and financial returns by applying best practices and integrating, both operationally and financially, the institution into the  Laureate International Universities network, and we have a strong track record of success. For all the institutions we acquired between 1999 and December 31, 2011, we achieved average enrollment and revenue CAGRs of approximately 15% and approximately 19%, respectively, in the four full years following the first anniversary of the acquisition. Further, we achieved operating income CAGRs (adjusted for impairment charges) of approximately 44%, translating into a margin expansion of nearly six percentage points for the same period. Additionally, we bring programs and expertise to increase the quality and reputation of institutions after we acquire them, and assist them in earning new forms of licenses and accreditations. We believe our experienced management team, history of strong financial performance rooted in the successful integration of previous acquisitions, local contacts and cultural understanding makes us the leading choice for higher education institutions seeking to join an international educational network. 
   Our History 
         We were founded in 1989 as Sylvan Learning Systems, Inc., a provider of a broad array of supplemental and remedial educational services. In 1999, we made our first investment in global higher education with our acquisition of Universidad Europea de Madrid, and in 2001 we entered the market for online delivery of higher education services in the United States with our acquisition of Walden University. In 2003, we sold the principal operations that made up our then K-12 educational services business and certain venture investments deemed not strategic to our higher education business, and in 2004 we changed our name to Laureate Education, Inc. Between the time we sold the K-12 educational services business in 2003 and August 2007, we acquired nine institutions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $160 million, including assumed debt, and entered seven new countries. 
         In August 2007, we were acquired in a leveraged buyout by a consortium of investment funds and other investors affiliated with or managed by, among others, Douglas L. Becker, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and founder, Steven M. Taslitz, a director of the Company, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (together with its affiliates, "KKR"), Point 72 Asset Management, L.P. (together with its affiliates, including Cohen Private Ventures, LLC ("Cohen Private Ventures"), "CPV"), Bregal Investments, Inc. (together with its affiliates, "Bregal"), StepStone Group LP (together with its affiliates, "StepStone"), Sterling Fund Management, LLC (together with its affiliates and investment funds managed by it, "Sterling Partners") and Snow Phipps Group, LLC (together with its affiliates, 
 18

   "Snow Phipps" and, collectively, the "the Wengen Investors"), for an aggregate total purchase price of $3.8 billion, including $1.7 billion of debt, all of which has been refinanced or replaced. See "Item 1ARisk FactorsRisks Relating to Our IndebtednessThe fact that we have substantial debt could materially adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy or to react to changes in the economy or our industry." We believe that these investors have embraced our mission, commitment to academic quality and ongoing focus to provide a social benefit to the communities we serve. 
         After being taken private in August 2007, we undertook several initiatives to continually improve the quality of our programs and outcomes for our students, while expanding our scale and geographic presence, and strengthening our organization and management team. Since August 2007, we have completed 41 acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2 billion, including assumed debt, and entered 12 new countries, and we now have a total institution count of 70. 
         In early 2013, International Finance Corporation ("IFC"), a member of the World Bank Group, the IFC Africa, Latin American and Caribbean Fund, LP and the Korea Investment Corporation (together with the IFC, the "the IFC Investors") collectively invested $200 million in our common stock. IFC is a global development institution that helps developing countries achieve sustainable growth by financing investment in the private sector and providing advisory services to businesses and governments. The investment in Laureate received the unanimous approval of the Board of Directors of the IFC in 2012. We believe that the IFC made its investment in our common stock to underscore its long-term commitment to supporting education with strategic clients that have the ability to develop much-needed job-market skills, because of our substantial presence in emerging markets and because of its belief that working with us would have a significant impact on human development in the countries where we operate. Two Laureate institutions received IFC investments even before their affiliation with Laureate. 
         In December 2013, the boards of directors of Wengen and Laureate authorized the combination of Laureate and Laureate Education Asia Limited ("Laureate Asia"). Laureate Asia was a subsidiary of Wengen that provided higher education programs and services to students through a network of licensed institutions located in Australia, China, India, Malaysia and Thailand. Wengen transferred 100% of the equity of Laureate Asia to Laureate. The transaction is accounted for as a transfer between entities under common control and, accordingly, the accounts of Laureate Asia are retrospectively included in the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. 
         We consummated our initial public offering ("IPO") on February 6, 2017. On January 31, 2017, in connection with our initial public offering, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Corporation was accepted for filing by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, and effective upon such filing, a 4 to 1 reverse stock split for our common stock was consummated and each share of our common stock then outstanding was automatically reclassified into Class B Common Stock, a newly established class of the Company's common stock, with any resulting fractional shares rounded down to the next whole share. On February 2, 2017, we filed a Prospectus for our initial public offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We issued 35,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock and began trading on the Nasdaq under the symbol "LAUR". The net proceeds to us from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, were $456.5 million. 
   Public Benefit Corporation Status 
         In October 2015, we redomiciled in Delaware as a public benefit corporation as a demonstration of our long-term commitment to our mission to benefit our students and society. Public benefit corporations are a relatively new class of corporations that are intended to produce a public benefit and to operate in a responsible and sustainable manner. Under Delaware law, public benefit 
 19

   corporations are required to identify in their certificate of incorporation the public benefit or benefits they will promote and their directors have a duty to manage the affairs of the corporation in a manner that balances the pecuniary interests of the stockholders, the best interests of those materially affected by the corporation's conduct, and the specific public benefit or public benefits identified in the public benefit corporation's certificate of incorporation. Public benefit corporations organized in Delaware are also required to assess their benefit performance internally and to disclose publicly at least biennially a report detailing their success in meeting their benefit objectives. 
         We do not believe that an investment in the stock of a public benefit corporation differs materially from an investment in a corporation that is not designated as a public benefit corporation. We believe that our ongoing efforts to achieve our public benefit goals will not materially affect the financial interests of our stockholders. Holders of our Class A common stock have voting, dividend and other economic rights that are the same as the rights of stockholders of a corporation that is not designated as a public benefit corporation. See "Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Investing in Our Class A Common StockAs a public benefit corporation, our focus on a specific public benefit purpose and producing a positive effect for society may negatively influence our financial performance." 
         Our public benefit, as provided in our certificate of incorporation, is: to produce a positive effect (or a reduction of negative effects) for society and persons by offering diverse education programs delivered online and on premises operated in the communities that we serve. By doing so, we believe that we provide greater access to cost-effective, high-quality higher education that enables more students to achieve their academic and career aspirations. Most of our operations are outside the United States, where there is a large and growing imbalance between the supply and demand for quality higher education. Our stated public benefit is firmly rooted in our company mission and our belief that when our students succeed, countries prosper and societies benefit. Becoming a public benefit corporation underscores our commitment to our purpose and our stakeholders, including students, regulators, employers, local communities and stockholders. 
   Certified B Corporation 
         While not required by Delaware law or the terms of our certificate of incorporation, we have elected to have our social and environmental performance, accountability and transparency assessed against the proprietary criteria established by an independent non-profit organization. As a result of this assessment, we have been designated as a "Certified B CorporationTM" under the standards set by an independent organization, which refers to companies that are certified as meeting certain levels of social and environmental performance, accountability and transparency. 
         The following description of the certification processes and standards was provided to us by the independent organization that designated us as a Certified B Corporation. The first step in becoming a Certified B Corporation is taking and passing a comprehensive and objective assessment of a business's positive impact on society and the environment. The assessment varies depending on the company's size (number of employees), sector and location. The standards in the assessment are created and revised by an independent governing body that determines eligibility to be a Certified B Corporation. 
         By completing a set of over 200 questions, which are customized for the company being assessed, that reflect impact indicators, best practices and outcomes, a company receives a composite score on a 200-point scale representative of its overall impact on its employees, customers, communities and the environment. Representative indicators in the assessment range from payment above a living wage, employee benefits, charitable giving/community service, use of renewable energy and, in the case of educational institutions like Laureate, student outcomes such as retention, graduation and employment rates. 
 20

          
        Certification as a Certified B Corporation requires that a company achieve a reviewed assessment score of at least an 80. The review process includes a phone review, a random selection of indicators for verifying documentation and a random selection of company locations for onsite reviews, including employee interviews and facility tours. In the case of Laureate's assessment, each subsidiary, as well as the corporate office in Baltimore, was required to complete an individual assessment for review that would be aggregated based on size to calculate an overall score. The assessment also includes a disclosure questionnaire, including any sensitive practices, fines and sanctions related to the company or its partners. 
         For Laureate, certification also required us to adopt the public benefit corporation structure, a step we have already completed. Once certified, every Certified B Corporation must make its assessment score transparent on the independent non-profit organization's website. Acceptance as a Certified B Corporation and continued certification is at the sole discretion of the independent organization. 
   Social Responsibility 
         We are serious about making an enduring commitment to the communities we serve. We do this through a range of scholarships and awards, donations to non-profits aligned with our mission and through creating international opportunities for our students. 
         As part of this commitment, since 2003, we have provided financial support to the International Youth Foundation ("IYF") directly and through our affiliated charitable foundation. The IYF was founded in 1990 with a grant from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation. IYF is a highly regarded international non-profit, with a mission to build partnerships, initiatives, and curricula that prepare young women and men to succeed as citizens, employees, entrepreneurs, and change-makers around the world. 
         IYF was started before we made our first investment in higher education and 13 years before we provided it with any financial support. Neither we nor our founder Mr. Becker controls or manages IYF, which is an independent and respected charitable organization. Mr. Becker has served as an unpaid volunteer member of the IYF's 14-member board, and the only IYF board member affiliated with us, since 2003 and as the board's chair since 2006. IYF has a longstanding relationship with the United States Agency for International Development ("USAID"), dating to 1999, and was cited for excellence by USAID during the George W. Bush administration. IYF has worked in partnership with USAID, the U.S. government agency that provides foreign assistance and promotes democracy in over 100 countries, on youth capacity-building, employability and civic engagement programs all across the world. These grants are awarded on a competitive basis, based on an organization's proven track record using funding to accomplish USAID goals. 
         Since 2003, we and our affiliated foundation have donated approximately $9 million to IYF. We have never received any funds from IYF. 
   Support of Recognized World Leaders 
         In 2010, former U.S. President Bill Clinton signed a five-year contract to serve as the Laureate International Universities network's Honorary Chancellor. During his term, President Clinton advised the network on issues such as social responsibility, youth leadership and civic engagement, while also speaking to students, faculty and staff worldwide. During his term, President Clinton visited 19 Laureate campuses in 14 countries. Immediately following the end of his term on its originally scheduled expiration date, the former president of Mexico, Ernesto Zedillo, assumed the similar role of Presidential Counselor for the Laureate International Universities network. 
 21

     Our Programs 
         We believe the diversity afforded by our program offerings helps insulate us against an economic downturn in any one area of study. We offer our programs through traditional classroom instruction as well as partially or fully online methods that we believe are attractive to both traditional students and working adults, a fast-growing cohort that we expect to represent an increasing part of our revenue mix in the future. Our fully online programs offer our students a convenient and cost-effective alternative to traditional classroom instruction and currently enroll students from over 175 countries worldwide. Our educational institutions offer a diverse range of academic programs, at the undergraduate and graduate level, including:


 Business & Management: Undergraduate and graduate programs in Accounting, Economics, Finance, Human Resources, International Business,
Management and Marketing. 
 Medical & Health Sciences: Undergraduate and graduate programs in Aesthetics, Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, Nutrition, Optometry,
Pharmacy, Physical Therapy, Psychology and Veterinary Sciences. 
 Engineering & Information Technology: Undergraduate and graduate programs in Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Environmental
Engineering, Computer Networks, Industrial Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Renewable Energies, Software Development and Telecommunications. 
 Architecture, Art & Design: Undergraduate and graduate programs in Architecture, Contemporary Art, Culture, Dance, Fashion Design, Game
Design, Graphic Design, Interior Design, Music and Theater. 
 Education: Undergraduate and graduate programs in multiple fields including Educational Theory, History, Language and Literature, Music,
Post-secondary Education, Primary & Secondary Education, Sciences and Special Education. 
 Law & Legal Studies: Undergraduate and graduate programs in Business Law, Contract Law, Criminal Justice Studies, Intellectual Property
and Real Estate Law. 
 Communications: Undergraduate and graduate programs in Communication Sciences, Corporate Communications, Journalism, Media Management and
Public Relations. 
 Hospitality Management: Undergraduate and graduate programs in Culinary Arts, Event Management, Hotel Management and Tourism Management. 

         Our educational institutions also offer upper secondary programs in Mexico. Our operational infrastructure and management approach are highly flexible and enable us to adapt quickly to unique situations and evolving international market trends. We continually monitor our programs that have been successful in their native markets and assess the ability to successfully provide a similar offering in other markets. This approach allows us to readily disseminate global best practices across different fields of study, optimize our educational delivery for the benefit of our students and further differentiate us from our locally based competition. We also provide convenient and flexible instructional delivery methods that allow students to attend classes, complete coursework and pursue a degree partially or entirely via distance learning, thereby increasing the convenience, accessibility and flexibility of our campus-based educational programs. We expect to leverage our already strong standing in these program areas through the continued development of rich media content, while bolstering our degree programs in other areas of study. We believe these flexible offerings distinguish us from many traditional universities that currently do not effectively address the flexibility required by students. 
         Many of our institutions have medical, dental and other health sciences programs that include providing clinical training to their students. As part of our commitment to civic engagement, we 
 22

   provide free or low-cost medical care to local community members. In 2015, approximately 150,000 patients were served by our institutions. 
   Our Operating Segments 
         On May 2, 2016, we announced a change to our operating segments in order to align our structure more geographically. Our institution in Italy, NABA, including Domus Academy, moved from our GPS segment into our Europe segment. MDS, located in New Zealand, moved from our GPS segment into our AMEA segment. Our GPS segment now focuses on Laureate's fully online global operations and on its campus-based institutions in the United States. We determine our operating segments based on information utilized by our chief operating decision maker to allocate resources and assess performance. See Note 6, Business and Geographic Segment Information, in our consolidated financial statements for financial information regarding our operating segments and financial information about geographic areas; see also "Item 7Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationResults of OperationsSegment Results andOverviewFactors Affecting ComparabilitySeasonality." 
   LatAm 
         As of the date of this Form 10-K, our LatAm segment consists of 29 licensed higher education institutions and has operations in Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Honduras, Mexico, Panama and Peru at which we enrolled approximately 823,600 students as of December 31, 2016. Our LatAm segment includes one institution in Ecuador with which we have contractual arrangements that are managed within the segment. The institutions primarily serve 18- to 24-year-old students and offer an education that emphasizes professional-oriented fields of study with undergraduate and graduate degrees in a wide range of disciplines, including business, education, hospitality management, law, health sciences, information technology and engineering.

  Tuition and Fees 
         Tuition varies at each of the higher education institutions in our LatAm segment depending on the curriculum and type of program. Tuition payment options vary by institution and primarily include monthly installment payment plans and lump sum payments at the beginning of the academic period. Historically, we have increased tuition as educational costs and inflation have risen. Students are generally responsible for transportation and housing expenses and costs related to textbook and supply purchases required for their educational programs. At some of the institutions, we offer these services to the student body, which generates incremental revenues. 
         Students and their families typically self-finance their education or seek third-party financing programs. However, in certain markets in Latin America there are various forms of government-supported student financing programs as discussed below. 
   Government-Sponsored Student Financing Programs 
         The Crédito con Aval del Estado (the "CAE Program"), a government sponsored student loan program in Chile, was enacted by the Chilean government in 2005 and formally implemented in 2006 to promote higher education in Chile for lower socio-economic level students with good academic standing. Chilean institutions in the  Laureate International Universities network (universities and technical-vocational schools) participate in this program. The CAE Program involves tuition financing and guarantees that are shared by our institutions and the government. As part of the program, Chilean institutions provide guarantees resulting in contingent liabilities to third-party financing institutions ranging from 90% to 60% of the tuition loans made directly to qualified students enrolled through the CAE Program. The guarantees by the institutions are for the period during which the student is enrolled, and the guarantees are assumed entirely by the government upon the student's graduation. Additionally, when a student leaves one of our institutions and enrolls in another CAE-qualified institution, our institution will remain guarantor of the tuition loans that have been granted to him up to such date, and until the student's graduation from the new CAE-qualified institution. All loans under the CAE Program have an interest rate of 2% per annum, contain repayment terms that would not require a graduate to make combined principal and interest payments of more than 10% of his or her monthly income in any month during the 180-month repayment period and provide that any balance remaining be forgiven at the end of the 180-month repayment period. Institutional accreditation by the National Accreditation Commission is required for new students to participate in the CAE Program. One of our institutions in Chile, Universidad de Las Américas ("UDLA Chile"), lost its accreditation for the period from January 2014 to March 2016 so new students at that institution could not participate in the CAE Program during that period. UDLA Chile's accreditation was reinstated in March 2016 for three years, until March 2019. The Nuevo Milenio scholarship ("NMS") program was created by the Chilean government in 2001 to support access to vocational and technical education for students in the lowest two income quintiles who met or exceeded certain academic standards. Originally, it provided eligible students with an annual scholarship grant of up to CLP 360,000. Over the years, eligibility was extended first to students in the three lowest income quintiles and then, in 2015, to the lowest 70% who met or exceeded certain academic standards, and the annual amount of the scholarship was raised incrementally to CLP 600,000. For 2016, the NMS was divided into three parts: (i) NMS I, which grants eligible students scholarships of up to CLP 600,000 per year; (ii) NMS II, which grants students scholarships of up to CLP 850,000 per year, provided the students come from the first five income deciles and the tech/voc institution in which they are enrolled is organized as a not-for-profit legal entity or, if the tech/voc institution is not so organized, the institution has stated in writing its intention to become a not-for-profit entity and to be accredited; and (iii) NMS III, which grants students scholarships of up to CLP 900,000 per year, provided that such students and the institution in which they enroll meet the requirements for NMS II and the tech/voc institution was, on December 31, 2015, accredited for four years or more. The Chilean 
 28

   tech/voc institutions in the Laureate International Universities network do not meet each of these tests, so students at these institutions are only eligible for NMS I scholarships under the current law. 
         There is no assurance that any legislation that is introduced or passed by the Chilean Congress will conform to the government's proposal. See "Item 1ARisk FactorsRisks Relating to Our BusinessPolitical and regulatory developments in Chile may materially adversely affect our operations." and "Item 1ARisk FactorsRisks Relating to Our BusinessRegulatory changes in Chile may reduce access to student financing for some of our students in Chile, which could reduce enrollments at our Chilean institutions." 
         In Brazil, there are two main federal government programs that provide either financing or financial support to students, the Fundo de Financiamento Estudantil ("FIES") and the Programa Universidade Para Todos ("PROUNI"). Both are used by substantially all of our Brazilian institutions. FIES provides direct financing to students. PROUNI is a government program that provides federal taxes incentives to educational institutions in exchange for providing scholarships to lower income students. In previous years, the Brazilian government made efforts to improve the operation of FIES and to increase overall participation, creating more higher education opportunities for the economically disadvantaged. However, due to a series of recent programmatic changes described below, we experienced a decrease in the enrollment of students participating in FIES in 2015. 
         FIES targets students from low socio-economic backgrounds enrolled at private post-secondary institutions. Eligible students receive loans with below market interest rates that are required to be repaid after an 18-month grace period upon graduation. FIES pays participating educational institutions tax credits which can be used to pay certain federal taxes and social contributions. FIES repurchases excess credits for cash. As part of the program, our institutions are obligated to pay up to 15% of any student default. The default obligation increases to up to 30% of any student default if the institution is not current with its federal taxes. In the past, FIES withheld between 1% and 3% of tuition paid to the institutions to cover any potential student defaults ("holdback"). If the student pays 100% of his or her loan, the withheld amounts will be paid to the participating education institutions. 
         Since February 2014, all new students who participate in FIES must also enroll in Fundo de Garantia de Operações de Crédito Educativo ("FGEDUC"). FGEDUC is a government-mandated, private guarantee fund administered by the Bank of Brazil that allows participating educational institutions to insure themselves for 90% (or 13.5% of 15%) of their losses related to student defaults under the FIES program. The cost of the program is 6.25% of the amount covered, which represents 5.63% of a student's full tuition. Similar to FIES, the administrator withholds 5.63% of a student's full tuition to fund the guarantee by FGEDUC. 
         As of December 31, 2016, approximately 20% of our students in Brazil participated in FIES, representing approximately 29% of our 2016 Brazil revenues. 
         In December 2014, the MEC along with the Brazilian Fund for Education Development ("FNDE"), the agency that directly administers FIES, announced several significant rule changes to the FIES program beginning in 2015. These changes limit the number of new participants and the annual budget of the program, and delay payments to post-secondary institutions with more than 20,000 FIES students that would otherwise have been due in 2015. The first change implements a minimum score on the high school achievement exam in order to enroll in the program. The second change alters the schedule for the payment and repurchase of credits as well as limits the opportunities for post-secondary institutions to sell any unused credits such that there is a significant delay between the time the post-secondary institution provides the educational services to the students and the time it receives payment from the government for 2015. In addition to these rule changes, FNDE implemented a policy for current students' loan renewals for 2015, which provides that returning students may not finance an amount that increases by more than 6.41%, which was later increased to 8.5%, from the amount financed in the previous semester, regardless of any increases in tuition or in the number of 
 29

   courses in which the student is enrolled, a policy that we believe violates the applicable law. For 2016, MEC announced that there will be no limitation to the tuition increase. Moreover, in the first and second intakes of 2015, the online enrollment and re-enrollment system that all post-secondary institutions and students must use to access the program has experienced numerous technical and programming faults that have also interfered with the enrollment and re-enrollment process. Numerous challenges to these changes and requests for judicial relief from the system's faults have been filed in the Brazilian courts, most of which are pending. The 2016 enrollment and re-enrollment schedule has been released and, so far, the system has not presented any major issues. 
         In October 2015, FNDE initiated negotiations with the Brazilian Association of Post-Secondary Institutions ("ABRAES") aiming at settling the FIES payments that were delayed in 2015. The proposal from MEC, which was accepted by ABRAES, was to divide the total amount due into three annual installments to be paid one fourth in 2016, one fourth in 2017 and half in 2018. The parties also agreed that the yearly installments will be paid in June of each year, and the amounts will be adjusted to reflect an inflation index from the date of the respective maturity until the effective payment. FNDE also agreed not to take any discriminatory measures in the future related to the payment due to the post-secondary institutions, and not to impose any limitation on the issuance of certificates and repurchase of credits due to the post-secondary institutions, which basically means that all certificates will be issued and repurchased in their respective fiscal years, except for those intended to be issued and repurchased in December, which will be paid in January of the following year. The parties executed the settlement agreement on January 28, 2016 and it was approved by the office of the Attorney General of Brazil on February 3, 2016. The Federal Court of Brasilia ratified the settlement agreement on March 17, 2016. Our post-secondary institutions in Brazil are associated with ABRAES and signed the settlement agreement as well; therefore, it will apply to us. 
         On December 11, 2015, MEC issued new FIES regulations ("Normative Ordinance No. 13"), which supersedes in all significant aspects the rules previously in force. Normative Ordinance No. 13 defined and clarified some rules for student eligibility and classification, higher education institution participation and selection of the vacancies that will be offered to the students in the first intake of 2016. 
         Among other changes, it created a "waiting list" concept for students not selected in the first selection call. It also instituted a rule that allows the remaining vacancies that were not filled in by the waiting list students to be redistributed among other programs of the post-secondary institution. 
         The rules for student eligibility are to have a gross household income of not more than 2.5 times the minimum wage per capita (which was raised by the MEC to 3.0 times on June 17, 2016) and to have taken the National High School Proficiency Exam at least once since 2010, with a minimum score of 450 points, and to have a score greater than zero in the test of writing. 
         Regarding the participation of post-secondary institutions in FIES, institutions must sign a participation agreement that contains their proposal of the number of vacancies offered and the following information per shift (morning, evening) and campus location: (i) tuition gross amount for the entire course, including all semesters; (ii) total tuition gross amount per course for the first semester, which must reflect at least a five percent discount to the course list price; and (iii) the number of vacancies that will be offered through the FIES selection process. Also, only courses with scores of 3, 4 or 5 in the National Higher Education Evaluation System ("SINAES") evaluation are eligible to receive FIES students. 
         On July 14, 2016, Provisional Presidential Decree No. 741/2016 (Medida Provisória No. 741/2016) revising the FIES payments rules was published in the official gazette. According to the new decree, higher education institutions became liable for the administration fees and expenses charged by the government banks that manage FIES loans. The decree became effective immediately and the government will withhold two percent of all FIES payments to cover such administration fees and 
 30

   expenses. Provisional presidential decrees are instruments with the force of law that the President of Brazil can issue in cases of importance and urgency. They have immediate effect and are valid for 60 days, extendable only once for the same period. Effectiveness beyond that period required approval of the National Congress, which took place on November 9, 2016, and it was enacted into law on December 2, 2016 (Law No. 13.366/2016). 
         In August 2016, the MEC issued additional FIES regulations ("Normative Ordinance No. 17") expanding the guidelines previously defined in Normative Ordinance No. 13. Among other things, Normative Ordinance No. 17 describes in greater detail how to calculate remaining vacancies, sets forth procedures and deadlines for the completion of the filling of the remaining vacancies, and provides for dealing with exceptional situations where procedural errors or other obstacles have prevented students from accessing remaining vacancies in a timely manner. 
         Another change in the new regulation was the number (or percentage) of vacancies that can be offered by the post-secondary institutions in relation to the score obtained in SINAES evaluation, which was reduced:
 

 to up to 50% of the number of vacancies in courses with a score of 5 (from up to 100%); 
 to up to 40% of the number of vacancies in courses with a score of 4 (from up to 75%); 
 to up to 30% of the number of vacancies in courses with a score of 3 (from up to 50%); and 
 to up to 25% of the number of vacancies in courses that are in the process of authorization by MEC (from up to 50%). 

         The criteria for the selection of vacancies by MEC to be offered to students were also modified by Normative Ordinance No. 13 and the regionality provisions of the prior Normative Ordinances (i.e., vacancies offered in the Northeast, North and Central-West regions would have had priority over those offered in the South and Southeast regions) were excluded from the regulation. Normative Ordinance No. 13 replaces the regionality criterion with a new criterion of "social relevance determined by micro-regions," which means that for each micro-region they will take into consideration the demand for higher education for educational financing (calculated by FIES) and the Human Development Index of each micro-region. All of the other criteria provided in the previous regulation were maintained in the new one (i.e., (i) FIES budget and the availability of resources, (ii) course score under SINAES's evaluation and (iii) priority courses, as defined by the government (pedagogy, engineering and health sector courses)). Normative Ordinance No. 13 also contains two annexes, which address in great detail the selection and tiebreaker criteria for the vacancies, as well as the rules for redistribution of remaining vacancies. 
         Brazil's economy continues to present challenges to growth and create pricing pressures in the education sector. Our new student enrollment in Brazil was negatively affected by these conditions as well as the changes to the FIES program. If economic conditions continue to weaken and the Brazilian government implements additional austerity measures, our ability to grow our student enrollment in Brazil may be further negatively affected. The Brazilian government's changes to the FIES program resulted in a substantial increase in the total number of new FIES contracts in that country in 2014, an election year, and then a reduction in the total number of new FIES contracts, from over 700,000 in 2014 to approximately 300,000 in 2015. As a result, Laureate's new enrollments of students in the FIES program also decreased similarly in 2015; however, this did not have a material impact on our 2015 results of operations since total enrollments for all students increased in 2015. Any potential impact on total enrollment would not occur until the FIES students from the expansion of the program have graduated, and would depend on the Brazilian government's commitment to the FIES program. In addition, the Brazilian government reduced the frequency of payments to participating institutions during 2015. 
 31

           These programs are more fully described in "Industry RegulationBrazilian Regulation" and "Industry RegulationChilean Regulation" and in Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

 Tuition and Fees 
         Tuition varies at each of the institutions in our Europe segment depending on the curriculum and type of program. Tuition payment options vary by institution and primarily include monthly installment payment plans and lump sum payments at the beginning of the academic year. Historically, we have increased tuition as educational costs and inflation have risen. 
         Students and their families are generally responsible for room and board fees, transportation expenses and costs related to textbook and supply purchases required for their educational programs. Several of our institutions in our Europe segment also have revenue-generating room and board fees. 
         Students typically self-finance their education or seek third-party financing programs. 
   AMEA 
         Our AMEA segment consists of 21 licensed higher education institutions, and has operations in Australia, China, India, Malaysia, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Thailand at which we enrolled approximately 85,700 students as of December 31, 2016 as adjusted for the realignment of MDS into our AMEA segment. The segment includes 9 licensed institutions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and one institution in China that we manage through joint venture or other arrangements. The institutions primarily serve 18- to 24-year-old students and offer an education that emphasizes professional-oriented fields of study with undergraduate and graduate degrees in a wide range of disciplines, including business, engineering, information technology, law, arts, fashion and design, education, hospitality management and health sciences, as well as vocational diplomas. 
 34

          
        We have historically focused on entering new geographic markets through acquiring institutions with an established name and operational history; however, we also occasionally work with local partners to enter markets through joint ventures to launch new higher education institutions. Through these partnerships, we can apply our programmatic and management expertise to help develop the institutions, while benefiting from our partner's local market knowledge and experience and limiting our financial exposure.

 Tuition and Fees 
         Tuition varies at each of the institutions in our AMEA segment depending on the curriculum and type of program. Tuition payment options vary by institution and primarily include monthly installment payment plans and lump sum payments at the beginning of the academic year. Historically, we have increased tuition as educational costs and inflation have risen. 
         Students and their families are generally responsible for room and board fees, transportation expenses and costs related to textbook and supply purchases required for their educational programs. Blue Mountains International Hotel Management School, our Chinese institutions, Monash South Africa, Stamford International University, the INTI Group and our Indian institutions have revenue-generating room and board fees. 
         Students typically self-finance their education or seek third-party financing programs. However, in certain markets in the AMEA region there are various forms of government-supported student financing programs, as discussed below. 
   Government-Sponsored Student Financing Programs 
         In Australia, the Commonwealth government has established income-contingent loan schemes that assist eligible fee-paying students to pay all or part of their tuition fees (separate schemes exist for higher education and vocational courses). Under the schemes the relevant fees are paid directly to the institutions. A corresponding obligation then exists from the participating student to the Commonwealth government. The Australian institutions have no responsibility in connection with the repayment of these loans by students and, generally, this assistance is not available to international students. In December 2016, the Australian government introduced a new loan scheme for vocational courses. This will replace the previous funding model for loans for vocational studies (which will be phased out during 2017). Under the new arrangements vocational educational providers will be required to reapply for registration for their students to be eligible to receive loans for vocational courses. To be eligible for registration vocational educational providers, among other matters, will be required to demonstrate a minimum of 50% completion rates. Relevant fees will be paid monthly in arrears and caps will be placed on the amount of loans available for particular categories of courses. THINK made a provisional application to be approved for these purposes and that application was approved until June 30, 2017, which is the maximum period available. THINK has submitted a further formal application for approval which, if granted, will apply from July 1, 2017 for a period of up to seven years. BMIHMS and TUA currently provide only higher education programs which are not affected by these changes. However, TUA has also made a formal application to cover vocational courses it may wish to offer in the future. The Australia institutions have been deliberately placing emphasis on higher education courses in TUA in anticipation of these changes. 
         In China, Thailand and Malaysia there are also government programs available to our students, however, they do not represent a material portion of the revenues of our institutions in these countries. In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, our students' tuition is fully funded by the government and the government pays the tuition for each student either directly to us or, in the case of RPI, to the institution which, in turn, pays us. The government also provides a monthly stipend to each student enrolled at the eight colleges of excellence, while at RPI, the private companies sponsoring the students 
 39

   pay the stipend. The payments are based on our enrollments, with minimum payments set for each institution. 
   GPS 
         Institutions in our GPS segment have products and services that span the Laureate International Universities network, with a total enrollment of approximately 72,200 students as of December 31, 2016, as adjusted for the segment change. Institutions in our GPS segment provide fully online degree programs through a U.S.-based accredited institution, Walden University, and internationally, through Laureate Online Education B.V., which is based in Amsterdam and partners with the University of Liverpool and the University of Roehampton in the United Kingdom. We provide professional-oriented fully online undergraduate and graduate degree programs largely to working professionals through distance learning and offer online degree programs in education, psychology, health and human services, management, nursing and information technology. These fully online institutions provide us expertise in online education that we can leverage throughout the campus-based institutions in our LatAm, Europe and AMEA segments. Our fully online institutions enrolled approximately 68,200 students as of December 31, 2016. 
         In addition, within this segment, we owned three smaller, campus-based institutions in the United States. Our GPS segment also provides support services to SFUAD. These campus-based institutions primarily serve 18- to 24-year-old students and offer an education that emphasizes professional-oriented fields of study. The curriculum in these institutions is leveraged throughout the Laureate International Universities network through student exchange programs, dual degrees and certificate offerings. These campus-based institutions enrolled approximately 4,000 students as of December 31, 2016. 
         The following table presents information about the institutions in our GPS segment (unless otherwise noted, we own each of these institutions):

 Tuition and Fees 
         Tuition varies at each of the institutions in our GPS segment depending on the curriculum and type of program. Tuition payment options vary by institution and primarily include monthly installment payment plans and lump sum payments at the beginning of the academic year. Historically, we have increased tuition as educational costs and inflation have risen. 
         Students at U.S. campus-based programs are generally responsible for room and board fees, transportation expenses and costs related to textbook and supply purchases required for their educational programs. 
         Currently there are no company-sponsored financing arrangements in our GPS segment. However, students in our U.S. Institutions are eligible for the U.S. Department of Education (the "DOE") Title IV program federal financial aid under the U.S. Higher Education Act (the "HEA"). 
 41

     Marketing 
         We believe that effective marketing is a key to the success of our business, enabling us to attract prospective students to our institutions and increase enrollment. We focus on marketing as a way to increase awareness of the institutions in each of their respective markets and to highlight the benefits provided by the  Laureate International Universities network. We leverage best practices across our entire network to help our institutions develop effective marketing programs. 
         We recognize that the vast majority of our students reside within the communities where our campuses are located. Because our target market is in close proximity to our institutions, developing and maintaining a powerful local presence is one of the cornerstones of our brand building strategy. We believe a strong brand is one of the key variables for future sustainable growth. We promote activities that encourage direct participation and interaction between the community and our institutions. For example, many of our institutions provide valuable services to the residents in the local communities including access to our veterinary and medical facilities at reduced costs, legal aid support and use of our facilities, including remedial course offerings and gym memberships. Additionally, many of our institutions' sports teams serve as a source of civic pride for the local residents including our students and their families. These informal interactions serve to enhance the trusted nature of our local brands, which in turn facilitates a word-of-mouth referral network that helps to attract quality students beyond the use of traditional student recruitment practices. 
         During enrollment campaigns, we augment our long-term brand building activities with professional advertising campaigns employing a variety of media, including television, radio, outdoor and print advertising. We also use direct mail, web advertising and one-on-one meetings with students and their families. Each institution is responsible for implementing its own marketing campaigns, although we provide a forum for the network's marketing departments to share best practices. During the last several years, we have increased the amounts spent on marketing and advertising to meet the large demand for our programs, and we anticipate that this trend will continue. 
         Additionally, we strive to develop strong relationships with local high schools that serve as feeder schools for many of our institutions. We believe we have developed strong relationships with many of these feeder schools and expect that will continue to provide a valuable source of referrals for many of the institutions in our network. 
   Competition 
         We face competition in each of our operating segments. We believe competition focuses on price, educational quality, reputation, location and facilities. 
   LatAm, Europe and AMEA 
         The market for higher education outside the United States is highly fragmented and marked by large numbers of local competitors. The target demographics are primarily 18- to 24-year-olds in the individual countries in which we compete. We generally compete with both public and private higher education institutions on the basis of price, educational quality, reputation and location. Public institutions tend to be less expensive, if not free, but more selective and less focused on practical programs aligned around career opportunities. We believe we compare favorably with competitors because of our focus on quality, professional-oriented curriculum and the competitive advantages provided by our global network. At present, we believe no other company has a similar network of international institutions. There are a number of other private and public institutions in each of the countries in which we operate. Because the concept of private higher education institutions is fairly new in many countries, it is difficult to predict how the markets will evolve and how many competitors there will be in the future. We expect competition to increase as the markets mature. 
 42

          
  GPS 
         The market for fully online higher education is highly fragmented and competitive, with no single institution having any significant market share. The target demographics for our Global Online institutions are adult working professionals who are over 25 years old. Our Global Online institutions compete with traditional public and private nonprofit institutions and for-profit schools. Typically, public institutions charge lower tuitions than our Global Online institutions because they receive state subsidies, government and foundation grants, and tax-deductible contributions and have access to other financial sources not available to our Global Online institutions. However, tuition at private nonprofit institutions is typically higher than the average tuition rates charged by our Global Online institutions. Our Global Online institutions compete with other educational institutions principally based upon price, educational quality, reputation, location, educational programs and student services. 
         See "Item 1ARisk FactorsRisks Relating to Our BusinessThe higher education market is very competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively." 
   Recent Developments 
   Sale of Glion and Les Roches Hospitality Management Schools 
         On March 15, 2016, we signed an agreement with Eurazeo, a publicly traded French investment company, to sell Glion and Les Roches and associated institutions (the "Swiss Institution Sale") for a total transaction value of CHF 380 million (approximately $385 million at the signing date), subject to certain adjustments.

LIUF comprised our five institutions located in France with a total student population of approximately 7,500: École Supériure du Commerce Extérieur, Institut Français de Gestion, European Business School, École Centrale d'Electronique and Centre d'Études Politiques et de la Communication. The transaction closed on July 20, 2016 and we received total net proceeds of approximately $207 million. 
   Senior Note Exchange Transaction 
         On April 15, 2016, we entered into separate, privately negotiated note exchange agreements (the "Note Exchange Agreements") with certain existing holders (the "Existing Holders") of our outstanding 9.250% Senior Notes due 2019 (the "Senior Notes due 2019," or the "Senior Notes") pursuant to which we will exchange $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes for shares of our Class A common stock. We expect the exchange to be completed within one year and one day after the consummation of our initial public offering. The number of shares of Class A common stock issuable will equal 104.625% of the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes to be exchanged, or $261.6 million, divided by $14.00, the initial public offering price per share of Class A common stock in our initial public offering. Following our initial public offering, but prior to the exchange, the Senior 
 43

   Notes subject to the exchange will continue to receive interest at the same rate as the Senior Notes that are not subject to the exchange. 
         Pursuant to the Note Exchange Agreements, on June 15, 2016 and March 1, 2017, we also repurchased from the existing holders approximately $85.1 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes at par value, plus accrued and unpaid interest and special interest. 
         Upon consummation of all of the transactions described above, we will have retired up to $335.1 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes. 
         At the initial public offering price of $14.00 per share, and assuming the completion of the exchange transaction one year and one day after the date of our initial public offering, we expect to issue an aggregate of 18,683,036 shares of Class A common stock in connection with the exchange transaction. 
         The exchange of Senior Notes for shares of Class A common stock will be effected in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. Nothing herein shall constitute or be deemed to constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the Senior Notes. 
   Series A Preferred Stock Offering 
         On December 4, 2016, we signed a subscription agreement (the "Subscription Agreement") with six investors, including KKR and Snow Phipps, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell to those investors an aggregate of 400,000 shares of a new series of our convertible redeemable preferred stock (the "Series A Preferred Stock") in a private offering for total gross proceeds of $400 million and net proceeds of approximately $383 million. Closing of the first tranche of funding for this transaction (the "Closing") occurred on December 20, 2016 and we received net proceeds, after issuance costs, of approximately $328 million. One investor funded a portion of its purchase price equal to $57 million (approximately $55 million net of issuance costs) on January 18, 2017 and the remainder on January 23, 2017. The proceeds from the Series A Preferred Stock offering have and will be used primarily to, among other things, repay a portion of our outstanding debt, including our revolving credit facility. 
         Dividends compound quarterly and, if not paid in shares of Series A Preferred Stock on a quarterly basis or in cash, accrue when, as and if declared by the board of directors of the Company, on each share of Series A Preferred Stock. The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to the payment of their liquidation preference in cash in certain circumstances, including upon the sale of the Company or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and upon a change in control of Wengen. The holders of Series A Preferred Stock do not have any voting rights except as required by law and with respect to certain extraordinary actions. 
         The shares of Series A Preferred Stock are only convertible into shares of our Class A common stock under certain circumstances, including upon the closing of a sale of the Company or Wengen, in the event Wengen no longer exclusively controls us and, following our initial public offering and except in certain circumstances, by us and the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock into shares of our Class A common stock commencing on the earlier to occur of one day following the first anniversary of the closing of our initial public offering and the time immediately prior to the effectiveness of a registration statement filed by us in connection with our first follow-on public offering following our initial public offering in which the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock receive net proceeds not less than the Priority Amount. "Priority Amount" means, generally, shares of our Class A common stock in a dollar amount equal to, as of any date of determination, the greater of (a) 25% of the aggregate offering price of all Class A common stock proposed to be offered and sold in our first follow-on public offering following our initial public offering and (b) $275 million. 
 44

           The shares of Series A Preferred Stock are redeemable (i) at our option subject to certain conditions, and (ii) by the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock after the fifth anniversary of the issue date, in each case, at a redemption price per share equal to 115% of the sum of the issue amount per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. If we fail to redeem the shares of Series A Preferred Stock when required after the fifth anniversary of the issue date, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to certain remedies, including the ability to take control of a majority of our board of directors and cause a sale of the Company and/or cause us to raise debt or equity capital in an amount sufficient to redeem the remaining outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock. 
         Upon the closing and funding of the purchase price of the Series A Preferred Stock offering in full, which was a qualified equity issuance under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as defined below), the applicable LIBOR margin for the 2021 Extended Term Loan (as defined below) under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities was reduced to 7.5% and the applicable ABR margin was reduced to 6.5%. The applicable LIBOR margin for the revolving credit line under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities was reduced to 3.75% and the applicable ABR margin was reduced to 2.75%. In addition, the additional scheduled payment on such 2021 Extended Term Loan in the amount of $62.5 million will not be required under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. 
   Intellectual Property 
         We currently own, or have filed applications for, trademark registrations for the word "Laureate," for "Laureate International Universities" and for the Laureate leaf logo in the trademark offices of all jurisdictions around the world where we operate institutions of higher learning. We have also registered or filed applications in the applicable jurisdictions where we operate for the marks "Laureate Online International" and "Laureate Online Education."

 Employees 
         As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 65,000 employees, of which approximately 9,000 were full-time academic teaching staff and 21,000 were part-time academic teaching staff. In addition, we have approximately 560 part-time academic teaching staff who are classified as contractors, principally in Chile and Brazil. Our employees at many of our institutions outside the United States are represented by labor unions under collective bargaining agreements, as is customary or required under local law in those jurisdictions. At various points throughout the year, we negotiate to renew collective bargaining agreements that have expired or that will expire in the near term. We consider ourselves to be in good standing with all of the labor unions of which our employees are members and believe we have good relations with all of our employees. 
 Effect of Environmental Laws 
         We believe we are in compliance with all applicable environmental laws, in all material respects. We do not expect future compliance with environmental laws to have a material adverse effect on our business.

   Industry Regulation 
   Brazilian Regulation 
         The Brazilian educational system is organized according to a system of cooperation among federal, state and local governments. Higher education (i.e., undergraduate and graduate level education provided by public and private higher education institutions ("HEI")) is regulated primarily at the federal level, particularly in terms of public policy goals, accreditation and academic oversight; however, the state and municipal governments are also involved, principally in relation to taxation, real estate and operational permitting issues. 
         With respect to the federal role, The National Educational Basis and Guidelines Law ("LDB"), provides the general framework for the provision of educational services in Brazil and establishes the duty of the federal government to:
 

 coordinate the national educational policy; 
 define the National Education Plan, in coordination with the states, the Federal District of Brasilia and municipalities; 
 provide technical and financial assistance to the states, the Federal District of Brasilia and municipalities; 
 establish, in collaboration with the states, the Federal District of Brasilia and municipalities, skills and guidelines for early childhood
education, elementary and secondary education that will guide the curriculum and their minimum syllabus, ensuring the regular basic education; 
 ensure national process of evaluation of higher education institutions, with the cooperation of evaluation agencies that have responsibility
for this level of education; 
 create an evaluation process for the academic performance of elementary, secondary and higher education in collaboration with educational
institutions in order to improve the quality of education; and 
 issue rules and regulations regarding higher education. 

         The responsibility of the Federal Government in regulating, monitoring and evaluating higher education institutions and undergraduate programs is exercised by MEC, along with a number of other federal agencies and offices that are related to MEC. 
   MEC 
         MEC is the highest authority of the higher education system in Brazil and has the power to:
 

 confirm the decisions of the National Board of Education ("CNE") regarding the accreditation and reaccreditation of institutions of higher
education; 
 confirm the systems and evaluation criteria adopted by the National Institute of Educational Studies Anísio Teixeira ("INEP"); 
 confirm opinions and regulatory proposals issued by the CNE; 

 46

   

 issue implementing rules, (regulations, notices, and technical advisories governing the conduct of higher education); and 
 regulate and monitor the system of higher education. 

   CNENational Board of Education 
         CNE is a consultative advisory and deliberative body of MEC. It consists of the Board of Basic Education and the Board of Higher Education, each composed of 12 members appointed by the President of Brazil. The Board of Higher Education has the power to:
 

 support the development and monitor the implementation of the National Education Plan; 
 analyze and issue opinions on the results of the evaluation procedures of higher education; 
 offer suggestions for drafting the National Education Plan and to monitor their implementation; 
 decide on the curriculum guidelines proposed by the MEC, for undergraduate courses; 
 deliberate on the reports submitted by MEC on the recognition of courses and qualifications offered by higher education institutions, as well
as on prior authorization from those offered by non-university institutions; 
 approve the authorization, accreditation and periodic reaccreditation of higher education institutions, based on reports and assessments
provided by MEC; 
 approve the statutes of universities and the regiment of the other higher education institutions that are part of the Federal educational
system; 
 deliberate on the reports for periodic recognition of master's and doctoral programs, prepared by the MEC, based on the evaluation of the
programs; 
 analyze matters relating to the implementation of legislation regarding higher education; and 
 advise MEC in higher education related matters. 

 INEPNational Institute of Educational Studies Anísio Teixeira 
         INEP is a federal agency linked to MEC that is the primary statistical and information-gathering body for the entire Brazilian education system. The performance data it collects and publishes is used by MEC, the legislature and the rest of the executive branch, as well as the public, to debate and make policy and programmatic decisions about education. INEP has the power to:


 carry out visits to institutions of higher education for on-site evaluations in the process of accreditation and reaccreditation of
institutions and in the authorization, recognition, accreditation and renewal of recognition processes of undergraduate and sequential programs; 
 conduct research and analysis of data related to education in Brazil; and 
 implement the SINAES. 

 CONAESNational Commission on Higher Education Evaluation 
         CONAES is a committee under MEC supervision composed of 13 members. CONAES has the power to:
 

 coordinate and monitor SINAES; 
 establish guidelines to be followed by INEP in the development of programmatic evaluation tools; 

 47

   

 approve the evaluation tools and submit them for approval by the Minister of Education; and 
 submit the list of programs to be evaluated by the National Examination of Student Performance ("ENADE") examination, to the Minister of
Education. 

 SERESHigher Education Regulation and Supervision Secretariat 
         In 2011, SERES, which operates as an arm of MEC, became the specific agency directly responsible for regulation and supervision of public and private HEIs, as well as undergraduate courses and lato sensu post-graduate programs, both in-person and distance learning modalities. Its mission is to elevate the quality level of all higher education through the establishment of guidelines for the expansion of HEIs and their courses, in accordance with national curriculum guidelines and proprietary quality parameters, and include:


 to plan and coordinate the policy-making process for the regulation and supervision of higher education; 
 to accredit undergraduate (and sequential) courses, both through in-person and distance learning; 
 to oversee HEIs and courses, in order to fulfill the educational legislation and to induce improvements in the quality of higher education
standards, applying the penalties provided for in legislation; 
 to establish guidelines for the preparation of assessment instruments for and higher education courses; 
 to manage the public system of registration and database of HEIs and higher education courses; and 
 to propose the design of actions and updating of reference and curriculum guidelines for undergraduate courses, as well as benchmarks for
quality distance education, considering curricular guidelines and various forms of technology. 

         According to the LDB, higher education can be offered by public or private higher education institutions. A private institution of higher education shall be controlled, managed and maintained by an individual person(s) or legal entity, in either case referred to as the "mantenedora." The mantenedora is responsible for obtaining resources to meet the needs of the duly authorized HEI, which in regulatory terms is referred to as the "mantida." A mantenedora may be authorized to operate more than one mantida. In any case, the mantenedora is legally and financially responsible for all of its mantidas. Each of our HEIs in Brazil is maintained by a Laureate-controlled mantenedora. 
         Private institutions of higher education may be:
 

 private institutions of higher education with profit purposes created and maintained by one or more individuals or private legal entities; 
 community institutions, founded by groups of individuals or one or more legal entities, including cooperatives, teachers and students that
include community representatives in its supporting entity; 
 religious institutions, instituted by individuals or groups for one or more legal entities that meet specific religious and ideological
orientation and that include community representatives in its supporting entity; or 
 nonprofit private institutions, charitable or not charitable, which are also sometimes referred to as philanthropic or nonphilanthropic. 

 48

           According to organizational and academic prerogatives, institutions of undergraduate learning can be:
 

 Colleges (faculdades): Colleges are institutions of public or private education offering degree
programs in more than one area of knowledge and that are supported by a single supporting entity and have specific administration and management. Colleges may offer programs at the following levels:
traditional undergraduate programs, technological undergraduate programs, specialization and graduate programs (master's and Ph.D. degrees). Colleges do not have minimum requirements for the
qualifications of professors and their labor practices, and cannot establish new campuses or create programs and new locations without the prior permission of
MEC.
 University Centers (centro universitários): University centers are public or
private educational institutions that offer a variety of programs in higher education, including undergraduate programs, extension courses and lato
sensu graduate programsmaster's and Ph.D. degrees; they must also provide learning opportunities and career development for their professors. At least one third of
the faculty of a university center must be composed of persons with masters or doctorate degrees. In addition, at least one fifth of its professors must be composed of professors who work full time.
University centers have the autonomy to create, organize and extinguish individual courses and degree programs, as well as relocate or expand locations in their existing programs in the municipality
where the university center's headquarters is located, without prior permission of MEC. A university center cannot open campuses outside the municipality where its seat is located. 
 Universities (universidades): Universities are public or private institutions of higher
education that offer several degree programs, extension activities and development of institutional research. Like the university centers, at least one third of the faculty of a university must be
composed of persons with masters or doctorate degrees. In addition, at least one third of a university's faculty must be composed of professors who work full time. Similar to university centers,
universities have autonomy to create, organize and extinguish individual courses and degree programs, as well as to relocate or expand locations in their existing programs in the municipality where
the university's headquarters is located, without prior permission of MEC. Additionally, universities have the ability, upon prior authorization by MEC, to apply for accreditation of new campuses and
courses outside the municipality where the university's seat is located, provided that they are within the same state as the seat. 

         Among the HEI in the Laureate International Universities network, there are three  faculdades (Faculdade Internacional da Paraíba, located in João Pessoa, PB; Faculdades Porto-Alegrense, located in Porto Alegre, RS; and Faculdade dos Guararapes de Recife, located in Recife, PE), six university centers (FADERGS Centro Universitário, located in Porto Alegre, RS; Centro Universitário dos Guararapes, located in Jaboatão dos Guararapes, PE; FMU Education Group, located in São Paulo, SP; Centro Universitário Ritter dos Reis, located in Porto Alegre, RS; Centro Universitário do Norte, located in Manaus, AM; and Instituto Brasileiro de Medicina de ReabilitaçãoIBMR, located in Rio de Janeiro, RJ), as well as three universities (Universidade Potiguar, located in Natal, RN; UNIFACSUniversidade Salvador, located in Salvador, BA; and Universidade Anhembi Morumbi, located in São Paulo, SP). In addition, Business School São Paulo, which is a professional degree-granting institution, is owned and operated by Universidade Anhembi Morumbi, and CEDEPE Business School, which is a professional degree-granting institution, is operated as a division of Faculdade dos Guararapes de Recife. As noted below, each form of HEI is entitled to a different level of autonomy within the regulatory framework. In turn, we factor the respective levels of autonomy into the operational strategy for each HEI, as the requirement of prior or post-facto MEC approval can delay or nullify specific new campus expansion projects, new course offerings, and increases in the number of authorized seats per course. 
         Legislation provides for specific levels of didactic, scientific and administrative autonomy to universities, university centers and colleges in differing degrees with the aim of limiting outside influence by other institutions or persons outside of the HEI's internal governance structure. 
 49

          
        LDB provides that the following powers are guaranteed to universities and university centers in the exercise of their autonomy:
 

 creation, organization, and extinguishment of degree programs in their facilities, subject to applicable regulations; 
 establishment of the curriculum of their courses and programs, subject to applicable general guidelines; 
 establishment of plans, programs and projects related to scientific research, artistic production and extracurricular activities; 
 establishment of the number of available seats; except in respect of programs in law, medicine, dentistry and psychology, where the total
number of available seats in the entire system is controlled by MEC in conjunction with the input of the relevant professional associations; 
 preparation and amendment of their bylaws in accordance with the general applicable standards; and 
 the right to grant degrees, diplomas and other qualifications. 

         LDB provides that the following powers are guaranteed to colleges in the exercise of their autonomy:
 

 establishment of the curriculum of their courses and programs, subject to applicable general guidelines; 
 establishment of plans, programs and projects related to scientific research, artistic production and extracurricular activities; 
 preparation and amendment of their bylaws in accordance with the general applicable standards; and 
 the right to grant degrees, diplomas and other qualifications. 

         Although colleges have administrative autonomy, they do not enjoy academic autonomy and, therefore, are subject to MEC's prior authorization to create new programs and degree programs. 
  Accreditation.    The first accreditation of an institution of higher education is necessarily as a college. The accreditation as a university or university center is only granted after the institution has operated as a college for at least six years and has demonstrated that it has met satisfactory quality standards, including positive evaluation by the SINAES, as well as met legal requirements applicable to each type of institution of undergraduate learning, including minimum degree attainment and terms of faculty employment. 
         LDB establishes that higher education shall include the following programs:
 

 continuing education programs (cursos sequênciais), open to applicants who meet
the requirements established by the higher educational institutions, provided they have completed high school or equivalent; 
 undergraduate programs, including traditional and technological undergraduate programs, that are open to applicants who have completed
secondary education or the equivalent and have passed the selection process or university entrance examination; 
 graduate programs, including master's degrees and Ph.D.s, specialization programs, advanced training courses and others, open to applicants who
have an undergraduate degree and meet the requirements set by the educational institutions; and 

 50

   

 extension programs with a social character that grant certificates to students, open to applicants who meet the requirements established, in
each case, by the educational institutions. 

         Following accreditation, colleges must obtain MEC permission to offer new undergraduate degree programs. As a consequence of their autonomy, universities and university centers do not require MEC authorization to create programs in the city where the university's or university center's seat is located. They need only inform MEC about the programs they offer for registration, evaluation and subsequent recognition. However, the creation of graduate programs in law, medicine, dentistry and psychology, whether by colleges, universities or university centers, are subject to the opinion of the proper professional associations. These associations are also consulted in the reaccreditation process. 
         Additionally, and as a consequence of their autonomy, universities also can apply for accreditation of campuses and the authorization and recognition of programs outside the municipality where the university's seat is located. The campuses and programs not located in the city of the university's seat are not entitled to the autonomy of the main university and must be controlled and supervised by the university. Effectively, these campuses are treated like colleges for educational regulatory purposes. Within the network in Brazil, the UnP Mossoró Campus, the UNIFACS Feira de Santana Campus and the UniRitter Canoas Campus fall into this category. 
         Once a university has obtained the authorization to provide a particular program, the HEI, including university centers and universities, also must obtain the recognition of such course, as a condition for national validation of the diploma. The application for recognition must be made at least one year after the start of the program and no later than half of the time required for its completion. The authorization and the recognition of programs and accreditation of institutions of higher education must be renewed periodically in accordance with the regularly applicable MEC evaluation process. 
  Evaluation.    SINAES was established to evaluate HEI as institutions of higher education, traditional degree and technology degree programs and student academic performance. The main objective of this evaluation system is to improve the quality of higher education in Brazil. In practice, the CONAES conducts the monitoring and coordination efforts of SINAES. The results of the institutional and course evaluations are represented on a scale of five levels and are considered in the process of accreditation, recognition and renewal of accreditation of programs and accreditation and reaccreditation of institutions. 
         In the case of unsatisfactory results, the HEI will be required to enter into an agreement with MEC that establishes a remediation program that includes among other requirements: (i) diagnosis of the unsatisfactory conditions; (ii) development and implementation of measures to be taken to remedy the unsatisfactory conditions; and (iii) establishment of deadlines and goals for remediation. 
         Failure to comply, in whole or in part, with the conditions provided in the term of commitment may result in one or more penalties imposed by MEC, including temporary suspension of the opening of the selective process for undergraduate programs and cancellation of accreditation or reaccreditation of the institution and the authorization for operation of its programs. 
         External evaluations of institutions of higher education are carried out by the INEP in two instances, first, when an institution applies for its first accreditation and second, by the end of each evaluation cycle of SINAES. Institutions of higher education are evaluated based on the following criteria, among others: (i) institutional development plan; (ii) social and institutional responsibility; (iii) infrastructure and financial condition; and (iv) pedagogical monitoring of student academic performance. 
         The evaluation of undergraduate programs is made at the time of the first accreditation by MEC, and consists of the analysis of academic methodology, faculty, student and technical-administrative bodies and the infrastructure of the institution and is periodically updated at the end of each evaluation cycle of SINAES. 
 51

           The evaluation of graduate programs is made by the Coordinating Agency for the Improvement of Highly Educated Persons ("CAPES"), which is responsible for establishing the quality standard required of masters and doctoral programs along with the identification and evaluation of the courses that meet this standard. Its recommendations are subject to the approval of the CNE. Programs are evaluated according to the requirements established for each specific program. CAPES updates its evaluation of graduate programs every three years, which is the validity period of an authorization. 
         The evaluation of student academic performance is conducted by INEP, which requires each student to sit for the ENADE in order to verify the knowledge and technical skill of the student body. Each ENADE test is developed in accordance with the content and specific curriculum of each educational program. Students enrolled in undergraduate programs take the ENADE every three years. In this system, students are evaluated at the end of the last year of each program. 
         The overall grade for each class of students is calculated based on the weighted arithmetic average of all students in a specific program selected for the exam. INEP evaluates the standard deviation of the student's evolution in each program in order to compare it with national standards. 
  Transfer of control of mantenedoras.    The change of control of mantenedoras does not require prior approval from MEC. A change of control need only be reported to MEC after the fact. However, the transfer of an HEI (mantida) to another mantenedora must be previously approved by MEC. The new mantenedora must meet the necessary requirements for accreditation of an institution of higher education and provide all appropriate documentation proving economic, financial and academic capacity to do so. Laureate's usual method for the acquisition of control is to acquire an interest in a pre-existing mantenedora. There may be circumstances in the future that warrant a departure from this course of conduct, in which case Laureate will follow the prescribed MEC requirements. 
         Although changes of control exercised by Laureate do not ordinarily need MEC prior approval or review, due to the level of Laureate's consolidated gross revenues throughout Brazil, current Brazilian law requires that every control transaction, with limited exceptions, that Laureate enters into must be submitted to the Brazilian anti-trust authority, the Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Economico (the "CADE"), for approval. Such request for approval must be granted prior to the definitive closing of such transaction. CADE has the power to reject and/or alter any transaction or any part of a transaction that it deems to unduly restrict competition. 
  Incentive program.    PROUNI is a federal program of tax benefits designed to increase higher education participation rates by making college more affordable. PROUNI provides private HEI with an exemption from certain federal taxes in exchange for granting partial and full scholarships to low-income students enrolled in traditional and technology undergraduate programs. All of our HEI adhere to PROUNI. 
         HEI may join PROUNI by signing a term of membership valid for ten years and renewable for the same period. This term of membership shall include the number of scholarships to be offered in each program, unit and class, and a percentage of scholarships for degree programs to be given to indigenous and Afro-Brazilians. To join PROUNI, an educational institution must maintain a certain relationship between the number of scholarships granted to regular paying students. The relationship between the number of scholarships and regular paying students is tested annually. If this relationship is not observed during a given academic year due to the departure of students, the institution must adjust the number of scholarships in a proportional manner the following academic year. 
         An HEI that has joined PROUNI and remains in good standing is exempted, in whole or in part, from the following taxes during the period in which the term of membership is in effect:
 

 IRPJ (income tax) and CSLL (social contribution), with respect to the portion of net income in proportion to revenues from traditional and
technology undergraduate programs; and 

 52

   

 Cofins (Contribution for the Financing of Social Security) and PIS (Program of Social Integration), concerning revenues from traditional and
technology undergraduate programs. 

         A number of municipal and state governments have sought to replicate PROUNI by creating their own programs that, for example, offer tax incentives through a reduction in, or credits against, the ISS (Municipal Services Tax) in exchange for scholarships to targeted social groups or professions. Laureate owns and operates HEI in several jurisdictions where such local incentive programs are in force. 
  Student financing program.    FIES is a federal program established to provide financing to students enrolled in courses in private institutions of higher education that have maintained a minimum satisfactory evaluation according to SINAES and receive a grade of 3 or higher out of 5 on the ENADE. The primary factor in determining whether a student is eligible to receive full or partial financing is how he or she scores on the program's means testing of household income relative to the cost of tuition. 
         Under this basic structure, FIES targets both of the government's education policy goals: increased access and improved academic quality outcomes. The HEI receives the benefit of the FIES program through its participation in the intermediation of CFT-E (Certificado Financeiro do Tesouro) bonds, which are public bonds issued to the HEI by the federal government that the HEI may use to pay the national social security tax imposed by the INSS (National Social Security Institute) and certain other federal tax obligations. If the HEI is current with its taxes (i.e., it possesses a tax clearance certificate and is not otherwise involved in any tax-related disputes with the federal government that are not being defended in compliance with applicable security/bond requirements) then the HEI also has the option to sell the bonds for cash in a public auction conducted by one of the government-sponsored banks. 
         Although the federal government is the direct creditor to the students, federal law stipulates that the HEI bear a portion of the credit risk, which level of risk has been subject to change in recent years. There are two different types of guarantees in FIES contracts:
 

 contracts with guarantor(s), when the student names someone (or a group of people) as the underwriter(s) of his or her loan. In this case, the
HEI is responsible for up to 15% (for institutions with no tax disputes) and up to 30% (if the institution has one or more open tax disputes that are not being defended in compliance with the
applicable security/bond requirements) of all related delinquencies. In the past, to effectuate this contribution the federal government withheld between 1% and 3% of the value of the HEI's monthly
CFT-E receipts during the course of the student's enrollment, but this has been replaced by the FGEDUC guarantee described below. In case there is no default, or the default is smaller than the amount
blocked, the federal government will release the withheld CFT-E amounts. The government has yet to establish guidelines determining how the HEI shall remit the unpaid balance in the event that the
default amount is higher than the blocked amounts; and 
 contracts with a guarantee by FGEDUC, a public fund created for this purpose, as the underwriter of his or her loan. Since February 2014,
FGEDUC has become mandatory for all new FIES students. In this case the federal government requires a contribution of 5.63% of the tuition value from the HEI. The HEI contributes 5.63% of the FIES
student's full tuition to the federal fund. FGEDUC guarantees 90% of the loan amount, leaving the HEI responsible for 15% of the other 10% in case of default. 

         Since February 2014, all new students who participate in FIES must also enroll in FGEDUC. FGEDUC allows participating educational institutions to insure themselves for 90% (or 13.5% of 15%) of their losses related to student defaults under the FIES program. The cost of the program is 6.25% of the amount covered, which represents 5.63% of a student's full tuition. Similar to FIES, the administrator withholds 5.63% of a student's tuition to fund the guarantee by FGEDUC. 
 53

           As of December 31, 2016, approximately 20% of our students in Brazil participated in FIES, representing approximately 29% of our Brazil 2016 revenues. 
         In December 2014, the MEC along with FNDE, the agency that directly administers FIES, announced several significant rule changes to the FIES program beginning in 2015. These changes raise the eligibility requirements, reduce the annual budget of the program and delay payments to post-secondary institutions with more than 20,000 FIES students that would otherwise have been due in 2015. The first change implements a minimum score on the high school achievement exam in order to enroll in the program. The second change alters the schedule for the payment and repurchase of credits as well as limits the opportunities for post-secondary institutions to sell any unused credits such that there is a significant delay between the time the post-secondary institution provides the educational services to the students and the time it receives payment from the government for 2015. In addition to these rule changes, FNDE implemented a policy for current students' loan renewals for 2015, which provides that returning students may not finance an amount that increases by more than 6.41%, which was later increased to 8.5%, from the amount financed in the previous semester, regardless of any increases in tuition or in the number of courses in which the student is enrolled, a policy that we believe violates the applicable law. For 2016, MEC announced that there will be no limitation to the tuition increase. Moreover, in the first and second intakes of 2015, the online enrollment and re-enrollment system that all post-secondary institutions and students must use to access the program has experienced numerous technical and programming faults that have also interfered with the enrollment and re-enrollment process. Numerous challenges to these changes and requests for judicial relief from the system's faults have been filed in the Brazilian courts, most of which are pending. The 2016 enrollment and re-enrollment schedule has been released and, so far, the system has not presented any material issues. 
         In October 2015, FNDE initiated negotiations with ABRAES aiming at settling the FIES payments that were delayed in 2015. The proposal from MEC, which was accepted by ABRAES, was to divide the total amount due into three annual installments to be paid one fourth in 2016, one fourth in 2017 and half in 2018. The parties also agreed that the yearly installments will be paid in June of each year, and the amounts will be adjusted to reflect an inflation index from the date of the respective maturity until the effective payment. FNDE also agreed not to take any discriminatory measures in the future related to the payment due to the post-secondary institutions, and not to impose any limitation on the issuance of certificates and repurchase of credits due to the post-secondary institutions, which basically means that all certificates will be issued and repurchased in their respective fiscal years, except for those intended to be issued and repurchased in December, which will be paid in January of the following year. The parties executed the settlement agreement on January 28, 2016 and it was approved by the office of the Attorney General of Brazil on February 3, 2016. The Federal Court of Brasilia ratified the settlement agreement on March 17, 2016. Our post-secondary institutions in Brazil are associated with ABRAES and signed the settlement agreement as well; therefore, it will apply to us. 
         On December 11, 2015, MEC issued Normative Ordinance No. 13, which supersede in all significant aspects the rules previously in force. Normative Ordinance No. 13 defined and clarified some rules for student eligibility and classification, higher education institution participation and selection of the vacancies that will be offered to the students in the first intake of 2016. 
         Among other changes, it created a "waiting list" concept for students not selected in the first selection call. It also instituted a rule that allows the remaining vacancies that were not filled in by the waiting list students to be redistributed among other programs of the post-secondary institution. 
         The rules for student eligibility are to have a gross household income of not more than 2.5 times the minimum wage per capita (which was raised by the MEC to 3.0 times on June 17, 2016) and to have taken the National High School Proficiency Exam at least once since 2010, with a minimum score of 450 points, and to have a score greater than zero in the test of writing. 
 54

           Regarding the participation of post-secondary institutions in FIES, institutions still must sign a participation agreement that contains their proposal of the number of vacancies offered and the following information per shift (morning, evening) and campus location: (i) tuition gross amount for the entire course, including all semesters; (ii) total tuition gross amount per course for the first semester, which must reflect at least a five percent discount to the course list price; and (iii) the number of vacancies that will be offered through the FIES selection process. Also, only courses with scores of 3, 4 or 5 in the SINAES evaluation are eligible to receive FIES students. 
         On July 14, 2016, Provisional Presidential Decree No. 741/2016 (Medida Provisória No. 741/2016) revising the FIES payments rules was published in the official gazette. According to the new decree, higher education institutions became liable for the administration fees and expenses charged by the government banks that manage FIES loans. The decree became effective immediately and the government will withhold two percent of all FIES payments to cover such administration fees and expenses. Provisional presidential decrees are instruments with the force of law that the President of Brazil can issue in cases of importance and urgency. They have immediate effect and are valid for 60 days, extendable only once for the same period. Effectiveness beyond that period required approval of the National Congress, which took place on November 9, 2016, and it was enacted into law on December 2, 2016 (Law No. 13.366/2016). 
         In August 2016, the MEC issued Normative Ordinance No. 17 expanding the guidelines previously defined in Normative Ordinance No. 13. Among other things, Normative Ordinance No. 17 describes in greater detail how to calculate remaining vacancies, sets forth procedures and deadlines for the completion of the filling of the remaining vacancies, and provides for dealing with exceptional situations where procedural errors or other obstacles have prevented students from accessing remaining vacancies in a timely manner. 
         Another change in the new regulation was the number (or percentage) of vacancies that can be offered by the post-secondary institutions in relation to the score obtained in SINAES evaluation, which was reduced:
 

 to up to 50% of the number of vacancies in courses with a score of 5 (from up to 100%); 
 to up to 40% of the number of vacancies in courses with a score of 4 (from up to 75%); 
 to up to 30% of the number of vacancies in courses with a score of 3 (from up to 50%); and 
 to up to 25% of the number of vacancies in courses that are in the process of authorization by MEC (from up to 50%). 

         The criteria for the selection of vacancies by MEC to be offered to students were also modified by Normative Ordinance No. 13 and the regionality provisions of the prior Normative Ordinances (i.e., vacancies offered in the Northeast, North and Central-West regions would have had priority over those offered in the South and Southeast regions) were excluded from the regulation. Normative Ordinance No. 13 replaces the regionality criterion with a new criterion of "social relevance determined by micro-regions," which means that for each micro-region they will take into consideration the demand for higher education for educational financing (calculated by FIES) and the Human Development Index of each micro-region. All of the other criteria provided in the previous regulation were maintained in the new one (i.e., (i) FIES budget and the availability of resources, (ii) course score under SINAES's evaluation and (iii) priority courses, as defined by the government (pedagogy, engineering and health sector courses)). Normative Ordinance No. 13 also contains two annexes, which address in great detail the selection and tiebreaker criteria for the vacancies, as well as the rules for redistribution of remaining vacancies. 
         Brazil's economy continues to present challenges to growth and create pricing pressures in the education sector. Our new student enrollment in Brazil was negatively affected by these conditions as 
 55

   well as the changes to the FIES program. If economic conditions continue to weaken and the Brazilian government implements additional austerity measures, our ability to grow our student enrollment in Brazil may be further negatively affected. The Brazilian government's changes to the FIES program resulted in a substantial increase in the total number of new FIES contracts in that country in 2014, an election year, and then a reduction in the total number of new FIES contracts, from over 700,000 in 2014 to approximately 300,000 in 2015. As a result, Laureate's new enrollments of students in the FIES program also decreased similarly in 2015; however, this did not have a material impact on our 2015 results of operations since total enrollments for all students increased in 2015. Any potential impact on total enrollment would not occur until the FIES students from the expansion of the program have graduated, and would depend on the Brazilian government's commitment to the FIES program. In addition, the Brazilian government reduced the frequency of payments to participating institutions during 2015. In 2017, a new rule was adopted as part of the FIES regulations that limits the total amount financed each semester to BRL 30,000 per student and allows the students to pay any amount in excess of such limit directly to the HEI (Normative Ordinance No. 04/2017). 
  Distance education.    Distance Education, or Educação à Distância ("EaD") in Brazil, is regulated by the LDB. The law defines EaD as an educational modality in which the didactic and pedagogical measurement in teaching and learning processes occur with the use of media, information and communication technologies, with students and teachers developing educational activities at different places and/or times. 
         EaD programs can be offered at different levels and types of higher education, like professional education, including technical, medium and technological level of higher education, higher education, covering continuing education programs, undergraduate, specialization, masters and PhD. EaD programs may only be offered by HEI that are regularly accredited by the MEC. The accreditation request and respective renewal for EaD programs is separate from the accreditation process for the in-person programs delivered by the HEI. 
         Universities and university centers accredited to offer EaD programs may create, organize and extinguish courses or higher education programs, upon notice to MEC, and the courses or programs created can only be offered within the limits of the scope defined in the HEI's accreditation act. Colleges (faculdades), must request MEC authorization to offer each specific EaD program. 
         The list of requirements for accreditation in the federal education system comprehends physical infrastructure, academic facilities, and details the characteristics and equipment for the library and laboratory operations, along with the accessibility plan and priority seating. Once issued, the EaD accreditation license issued by MEC defines the scope of the HEI's EaD operations in the country, and any expansion beyond the licensed area may only occur with specific MEC permission. The HEI accreditation for the provision of EaD programs is valid for the evaluation cycle term and is renewable. 
         EaD programs must be designed with the same duration as their respective in-person course programs. Moreover, the EaD regulatory scheme requires that the HEI perform some aspects in-person as follows: (i) student assessments; (ii) compulsory trainee programs, when provided for in the relevant legislation; (iii) dissertation defense for course completion, when provided for in the relevant legislation; and (iv) activities related to teaching laboratories, where applicable. The in-person events must be performed at the HEI's campus or at a specific, brick and mortar learning center duly accredited for this purpose, referred to as a "polo." 
         It is also noteworthy that the HEI offering EaD programs, particularly the polos, are subject to inspection by the MEC at any time. Those inspections aim to demonstrate whether those HEI are compliant with legal and regulatory requirements. In the event of any irregularity not corrected within the given deadlines, the HEI may be subject to certain penalties, including disqualification. 
 56

           EaD certificates or diplomas issued by accredited HEI have national validity with the same force and effect as those certificates or diplomas issued for the completion of in-person programs. 
   Chilean Regulation 
         The Political Constitution of the Republic of Chile guarantees every individual's right to education and sets forth the state's obligation to promote the development of education at all levels. It also provides for liberty in teaching, which includes the right to open, organize and maintain educational institutions, providing that a Constitutional Organic Law, which requires a super-majority vote in the Chilean Congress, must establish the requirements for the official recognition of educational institutions. 
         The General Law on Education sets forth the requirements and the procedure for the official recognition of educational institutions, providing for an educational system that is mixed in nature, including a form of education owned and managed by the state and its bodies and another one that is privately provided. The principles that inspire the Chilean educational system include those of universality, by virtue of which education should be affordable to all individuals, quality of education, and respect for and promotion of the autonomy of the educational institutions, within the framework of the laws governing them. 
         In the case of higher education, the law provides a licensing system for new institutions that, once completed, makes it possible for these institutions to achieve full autonomy. This autonomy consists of every higher education institution's right to govern itself, as provided in its bylaws, in all matters regarding the fulfillment of its purpose, and encompasses academic, economic and administrative autonomy. Academic autonomy includes the higher education entities' power to decide by themselves the manner in which their teaching, research and extension functions will be fulfilled and the establishment of their curricula and programs. Economic autonomy makes it possible for those establishments to manage their resources to fulfill their goals pursuant to their bylaws and the laws, while administrative autonomy empowers each higher education establishment to organize its operation in the form deemed most appropriate in accordance with its bylaws and the relevant laws. 
         The Ministry of Education ("MINEDUC") is the department of state in charge of promoting the development of education at all levels. Its functions include those of proposing and assessing the policies and plans for educational and cultural development, assigning the necessary resources for the conduct of educational and cultural extension activities, evaluating the development of education, discussing and proposing general norms applicable to the sector and overseeing their enforcement, granting official recognition to educational institutions, supervising the activities of its dependent units and fulfilling the other functions assigned by the law. 
         The MINEDUC's Higher Education Division is the unit in charge of overseeing compliance with the legal and regulatory norms that govern higher education, of providing advice on the proposal of policies at this level of education and of establishing institutional relations with the officially recognized higher education institutions. 
         The National Education Council (Consejo Nacional de Educación) is an autonomous entity composed of ten members who must be academicians, professors or professionals with an outstanding career in teaching and educational management and whose functions, regarding higher education, consist of:
 

 managing the license-granting system for new institutions; 
 deciding on institutional projects submitted by institutions for the purpose of their official recognition; 
 verifying the development of institutional projects of the institutions that have been approved; 

 57



 establishing selective examination systems for the subjects or courses of study delivered by the higher education institutions subject to
license-granting processes in order to evaluate compliance with the curricula and programs and the performance of students; 
 requesting from the MINEDUC, on a supported basis, the revocation of official recognition of the universities, professional institutes and
technical training centers under the license-granting process; 
 managing the revocation process of higher education institutions; 
 assisting the MINEDUC in the management of the shutdown processes of autonomous higher education institutions, especially as to the process of
awarding diplomas and degrees to students who are in the course of their education at the time of shutdown; and 
 serving as an appeals body for decisions of the National Accreditation Commission. 

         The National Accreditation Commission (Comisión Nacional de Acreditación) is an autonomous entity, the function of which is to verify and promote the quality of the autonomous universities, professional institutes and technical training centers and of the courses of study and programs offered by them. In particular, the National Accreditation Commission is required to deliver an opinion on the institutional accreditation of higher education institutions, authorize the private agencies in charge of accreditation of courses of study and undergraduate programs and bachelor programs and specialty programs in the area of health, and supervise their operation. 
         The Managing Commission of the Credit System for Higher Education Studies (Comisión Administradora del Sistema de Créditos para Estudios Superiores) is an entity whose functions include defining and assessing policies for the development and implementation of financing arrangements for higher education studies, entering into and proposing modifications to any necessary agreements with both domestic and foreign public and private financing entities and implementing those arrangements, and defining and evaluating the policies for higher education loans guaranteed by the state. 
         Organization and recognition of higher education institutions.    The law recognizes state-owned higher education institutions, which may only be created by a law, and private institutions that must be organized in accordance with provisions contained in the law. The Chilean legislation provides that the state will officially recognize the following higher education institutions: 
 

 Universities:  Universities may grant professional certificates and all
kinds of academic degrees, including graduate certificates, bachelor's degrees and Ph.Ds. Universities are the only institutions entitled to grant professional certificates with respect to which the
law requires having previously obtained a bachelor's degree. 
 Professional Institutes:  Professional institutes may only confer
professional certificates of the type that do not require a bachelor's degree, and technical certificates of a superior level to those students who have completed programs of at least 1,600 class
hours without receiving a bachelor's degree. 
 Technical Training Centers:  Technical training centers may only confer a
technical certificate of a superior level to those students who have completed programs of at least 1,600 class hours. 
 Educational institutions of the armed forces and police. 

         Private universities must be created in accordance with the procedures set forth by law, and must always be not-for-profit entities in order to be officially recognized. 
         Private professional institutes and technical training centers may be created by any individual or legal entity, they may be organized as for-profit or not-for-profit entities, and their sole purpose must be the creation, organization and maintenance of a professional institute or technical training center. 
 58

           In order to be officially recognized, universities, professional institutes and technical training centers must have the necessary teaching, didactic, economic, financial and physical resources to offer the academic degrees, professional certificates or technical certificates, as appropriate, which must be certified by the National Education Council. Additionally, these institutions must have a certification granted by the National Education Council evidencing that the entity has had both its institutional project and its academic programs approved and that it will have the progressive verification of its institutional development performed. Higher education institutions may only start their teaching activities once the official recognition has been granted. 
         The official recognition of a higher education institution may be revoked and, in the case of universities, their legal existence may be revoked through a supported Statutory Decree of the MINEDUC, after a decision of the National Education Council adopted by the majority of its members in a meeting called for that sole purpose and after hearing the affected party, if that party (i) fails to comply with the objectives set forth in its bylaws, (ii) conducts activities contrary to morals, public order, good customs or national security, (iii) commits gross violations of its bylaws, or (iv) ceases to confer professional certificates to its graduates. 
         The law provides for a system of license grants to higher education institutions, which includes the approval of institutional project and the evaluation, progress and materialization of its educational project for a period of no less than six years, at the end of which they may become fully autonomous. 
  National system of quality assurance in higher education.    The law provides for a system of quality assurance in higher education that includes a system of institutional accreditation that consists of a process of analysis of existing mechanisms within the autonomous higher education institutions to guarantee their quality, bearing in mind both the existence of those mechanisms and their application and results, and a process of accreditation of courses of study or programs, consisting of a process of verification of the quality of the courses of study or programs offered by the autonomous higher education institutions, on the basis of their declared purposes and the criteria set forth by the respective academic and professional communities. 
         Both the institutional accreditation and the accreditation of courses of study and undergraduate programs are voluntary, except that the courses of study and academic programs leading to the professional degrees of Surgeon, Elementary Education Teacher, Secondary Education Teacher, Differential Education Teacher and Nursery School Teacher are subject to mandatory accreditation. 
         The institutional accreditation is filed with the National Accreditation Commission, whereas the accreditation of courses of study and undergraduate programs can be performed by domestic, foreign or international accreditation entities authorized by the National Accreditation Commission. 
  Tax benefits.    Chilean universities recognized by the state, and the associations, corporations, partnerships and foundations that are created, organized or maintained by those universities, are exempted from paying tax on the income arising exclusively from their educational activities. Likewise, educational institutions are exempted from paying value-added tax, an exemption that is limited to the revenues arising from their teaching activities. Additionally, universities are exempted from paying withholding taxes for payments made abroad. There are also specific tax benefits for donations made to universities. 
  Financing.    The Chilean state contributes to the direct financing of universities existing as of December 31, 1980 by means of contributions from the state. In addition, all universities, professional institutes and technical training centers recognized as higher education institutions receive an indirect contribution from the state, which is distributed on the basis of the scores obtained in the university admission test by the students enrolled in each higher education institution. 
 59

           Under the CAE Program, the state guarantees up to 90% of the principal plus interest on loans granted by financial institutions to students of higher education at autonomous, accredited institutions officially recognized by the state that select their first-year students on the basis of the score obtained in the university admission test and that use the aforesaid indirect contribution by the state exclusively for institutional development purposes. 
         The NMS program supports access to vocational and technical education for students in the lowest 70% who met or exceeded certain academic standards by providing annual scholarships (i) under NMS I in amounts up to CLP 600,000; (ii) under NMS II in amounts up to CLP 850,000 per year for students who come from the first five income deciles if the tech/voc institution in which they are enrolled is organized as a not-for-profit legal entity or, if the tech/voc institution is not so organized, the institution has stated in writing its intention to become a not-for-profit entity and to be accredited; and (iii) under NMS III in amounts up to CLP 900,000 per year, provided that such students and the institution in which they enroll meet the requirements for NMS II and the tech/voc institution was, on December 31, 2015, accredited for four years or more. 
  Recent developments.    Because of an ongoing controversy in Chile with respect to the quality of higher education and compliance with the regulations applicable to higher education institutions, since July 2011 several reforms have been promoted by the Chilean government. Some of these reforms were approved during the previous administration, such as amendments to the CAE Program reducing from 6% to 2% per annum the interest rate that CAE debtors must pay, limiting principal and interest payments under that program to 10% of a debtor's monthly income, and providing for the termination of the debt after a 180-month period. 
         Other legislative reforms were promoted by members of the previous Chilean Congress but were not supported by the previous Chilean government, including proposals to restrict related party transactions between higher education institutions and entities that control them. In November and December 2013, Chile held national elections. The presidential election was won by former president Michelle Bachelet, who assumed office on March 11, 2014, and a political coalition led by Ms. Bachelet won the elections for both houses of the Chilean Congress, in each case for four years beginning on March 11, 2014. Although the election platform of the new government mentioned that stronger regulation of higher education was required, it did not contain specific commitments with respect to the abovementioned reforms, other than the creation of a special agency to oversee higher education institutions' compliance with law and regulations. In the second quarter of 2014, the new government announced the withdrawal of all of the prior administration's higher education proposals and its intent to submit new bills to the Chilean Congress. 
         In December 2014, the Chilean Congress adopted the Provisional Administrator Law, which provides for the appointment of a provisional administrator or closing administrator to handle the affairs of failing universities or universities found to have breached their bylaws (the "Provisional Administrator Law"). In addition, the Chilean Congress has approved legislation that would permit, but not require, universities and technical/vocational institutes to include in their bylaws provisions contemplating the participation of students, professors and employees in the governance of the institution. 
         On November 27, 2015, the Chilean Congress passed the 2016 budget law (the "2016 Budget Law"). By means of the 2016 Budget Law, the administration sought to implement a policy to grant free access to higher education to students from the first five income deciles who attend certain universities or tech/voc institutions. For university students, the Budget Law would have required them to be enrolled in universities that either are members of the Consejo de Rectores de las Universidades Chilenas (the "CRUCh") or are private universities that are not members of the CRUCh that, on September 30, 2015, met the following requirements: (a) being accredited for four years or more; (b) not being related to for-profit legal entities; and (c) having a representative of the students or 
 60

   non-academic personnel as a member of their governing body. For tech/voc students, the 2016 Budget Law would have required them to be enrolled in institutions organized as not-for-profit legal entities that were accredited for four or more years. 
         On December 21, 2015, the Constitutional Tribunal (the "CT") declared portions of the 2016 Budget Law dealing with higher education institutions to be unconstitutional, in particular those portions that would require students to attend institutions with specific characteristics in order to obtain free tuition as, under the Chilean Constitution, that would constitute arbitrary discrimination affecting students who are in the same economic condition. 
         Before the CT published the text of its decision, the administration submitted a bill modifying the 2016 Budget Law that establishes different conditions to access free higher education (the ley corta or "Short Law") to the Chilean Congress. The Short Law was approved by Congress two days after its submission, on December 23, 2015, and published on December 26, 2015. The Short Law was effective only during 2016 and was not subject to a constitutional challenge. 
         Under the Short Law, for university students to be eligible for free tuition, they had to come from the first five income deciles and enroll either in a State-owned university or in a private university that on December 27, 2015 was accredited for at least four years and controlled by individuals or not-for-profit legal entities. The Short Law excluded tech/voc students from eligibility for free tuition in 2016. However, the Short Law provided that free tuition for tech/voc students would be implemented within three years provided that they attend tech/voc institutions that were accredited for at least four years and were organized as not-for-profit legal entities. The Short Law provided that tech/voc institutions that were organized as for-profit entities should, not later than December 27, 2015, state their intention to reorganize as not-for-profit entities in order to be eligible to participate in NMS II and NMS III. 
         For the period between the effective date of the Short Law and such time as students at tech/voc institutions became eligible to participate in the free tuition program, the Short Law modified the allocations of the NMS. The Short Law divided this scholarship program into three parts: (i) NMS I, which grants students who meet certain personal conditions scholarships of up to CLP 600,000 per year; (ii) NMS II, which grants students scholarships of up to CLP 850,000 per year, provided the students come from the first five income deciles and the tech/voc institution in which they are enrolled is organized as a not-for-profit legal entity or, if the tech/voc institution is not so organized, the institution has stated in writing its intention to become a not-for-profit entity and to be accredited; and (iii) NMS III, which grants students scholarships of up to CLP 900,000 per year, provided that such students and the institution in which they enroll meet the requirements for NMS II and the tech/voc institution was, on December 31, 2015, accredited for four years or more. 
         The Chilean universities and tech/voc institutions in the Laureate International Universities network did not meet each of these tests, so students at these institutions were not eligible for free tuition or NMS II or NMS III scholarships under the Short Law. 
         On November 11, 2016, the Chilean Congress passed the 2017 budget law (the "2017 Budget Law"). The 2017 Budget Law included changes to the policies for granting free access to higher education and scholarships to students from the first five and seven income deciles who attend certain universities or tech/voc institutions. 
         For university students, the 2017 Budget Law provides for free access to higher education with the same requirements as were in the 2016 Budget Law but adds the requirement that eligible universities have a minimum of 80% of their newly enrolled students with an average result from the national university admissions examination, high school grades and high school rankings above a specified level, and have a transparent admission system that must have been published on the institution's website by December 1, 2016. For tech/voc institutions, the 2017 Budget Law provides for eligibility for free access 
 61

   for students if they are enrolled in institutions (i) organized as not-for-profit legal entities or as for-profit legal entities that have filed for transformation to not-for-profit legal entities under the "Transformation Law" passed by the Chilean Congress on November 16, 2016, before December 15, 2016, (ii) accredited for four years or more as of December 23, 2016, (iii) having as controllers not-for-profit legal entities or natural persons, (iv) having stated their intention to participate in the free access system before December 15, 2016, and (v) having a transparent admission system that must have been published on the institution's website by December 1, 2016. 
         The 2017 Budget Law also modified the allocations of the Bicentenario Scholarship ("the BS Program"). The BS Program supports access to higher education for university students coming from one of the first seven income deciles and covers the full amount of tuition up to an amount authorized by the government. Historically, the BS Program solely benefited students of CRUCh universities. The 2017 Budget Law terminated the differentiation between CRUCh and non-CRUCh universities for eligibility for the BS Program. Thus, for 2017, 3,500 BS Program scholarships will be granted to students at non-CRUCh universities and 3,500 additional BS Program scholarships will be granted to students at non-CRUCh universities in 2018. By 2019, the government promises to have an equal BS Program scholarship policy for all universities, whether CRUCh or non-CRUCh. Students may apply for a BS Program scholarship if their university is accredited for at least four years and if 80% of the university's newly enrolled students have an average result from the national university admissions examination, high school grades and high school rankings above a specified level. 
         Under the 2017 Budget Law, the NMS II and NMS III are available to all students enrolled in a tech/voc institution, whether for-profit or not-for-profit: (i) NMS II in an amount of CLP 860,000 per year, or up to the effective government-approved tuition fee if it is less than that amount, for students who come from the first five income deciles with an average high school grade of 5.0 and the tech/voc institution in which they are enrolled being accredited for at least three years; and (ii) NMS III, in an amount up to CLP 900,000 per year, or up to the effective government-approved tuition fee if it is less than that amount, provided that such students and the institution in which they enroll meet the requirements for NMS II and the tech/voc institution was, on December 31, 2016, accredited for four years or more. The NMS III scholarship will last until the tax benefit established in the Transformation Law for tech/voc institutions ends. 
         Finally, under the 2017 Budget Law, the Comptroller General will be in charge of overseeing the use of the public resources in higher education. 
         In April 2016, the Chilean Congress made reforms to specific career disciplines, including pedagogy. Law 20,903 created the teaching professional development system (Sistema de Desarrollo Profesional Docente), which aims to improve the quality of training for those who choose to study pedagogy by setting new program admission requirements and mandatory institutional accreditation standards for pedagogy career programs. As these changes have only taken effect in 2017, their impact cannot yet be determined; however, the Chilean universities in the Laureate International Universities network are preparing to adjust to the new regime and will be monitoring the effects on their pedagogy programs. 
         On July 4, 2016, the Chilean President submitted to the Chilean Congress a bill (the "Higher Education Bill") that, if approved, would change the entire regulatory landscape of higher education in Chile, as it would amend and/or replace most of the currently applicable legislation, including repealing the current laws governing universities, professional institutes and technical training centers. The changes contemplated in the Higher Education Bill that are most relevant to us are: 
 

(1)The
creation of an Undersecretary of Higher Education, which would replace and be the legal successor to the current Higher Education Division of the MINEDUC and
whose functions would be: (i) to propose to the MINEDUC policies on higher education, including policies on access, inclusion, retention and graduation of higher education students, on the
promotion, 

 62

   

development,
support and continuous improvement of the quality of higher education institutions and their relationship with the needs of the country, and on the allocation of public funds;
(ii) to manage the procedures relating to the granting and revocation of the official recognition of higher education institutions; (iii) to take custody of the academic records of
higher education institutions that have lost their official recognition; (iv) to manage the Common Access System for Higher Education Institutions; (v) to manage the National Higher
Education Information System; (vi) to coordinate the various public institutions and services that have authority on higher education matters; (vii) to establish coordination mechanisms
for the members of the boards of directors of state-owned universities who are appointed by the President; (viii) to generate and coordinate with regional and local governments instances of
participation and dialogue with and among higher education institutions as well as the collaboration and transfer of best practices among them, and between such institutions and secondary schools;
(ix) to develop studies on the higher education system; (x) to maintain a registry of higher education institutions with access to public funding; and (xi) to have any other
function that the law may assign to it. 


(2)The
creation of a new Common Access System for Higher Education Institutions, to be managed by the Undersecretary of Higher Education, which would establish the
process and mechanisms for the application, admission and selection of undergraduate students, and which would be mandatory at all higher education institutions that receive public funding through the
MINEDUC.
(3)The
creation of a National Higher Education Information System, to be managed by the Undersecretary of Higher Education, which would include, among other things,
information about students, enrollment, faculty, resources, infrastructure and results of the academic process at higher education institutions; about the nature of the higher education institutions,
their members and individuals that are part of their administrative bodies; about the financial condition and solvency of higher education institutions, including their annual audited financial
statements; and information about related party transactions. Both the Superintendence of Higher Education and the Higher Education Quality Council would provide all information they receive from
higher education institutions to the Undersecretary of Higher Education to be included in the National Higher Education Information System.
(4)The
creation of a new National System of Quality Assurance of Higher Education, to be established by the MINEDUC through the Undersecretary of Higher Education, the
National Education Council, the Higher Education Quality Council and the Superintendence of Higher Education, the functions of which, among others, would be to: (i) develop policies to promote
quality, suitability, articulation, inclusion and equality in the execution of the duties of higher education institutions; (ii) license new higher education institutions; (iii) provide
the institutional accreditation of autonomous higher education institutions; and (iv) enforce the compliance of higher education institutions with the rules applicable to higher education and
the legality of the use of their resources, supervise their administrative and financial feasibility, and their academic commitments to students. 

The
Higher Education Quality Council, whose purpose would be to evaluate, accredit and promote the quality of autonomous higher education institutions and of the careers and study programs they offer,
and which would be responsible for executing the institutional accreditation processes and undergraduate and graduate career and study programs accreditation processes, would be composed of 11
directors, nine of which would be appointed by the President of the Republic. The functions of the Higher Education Quality Council would include: (i) managing and resolving the accreditation
processes; (ii) proposing the quality criteria and standards for institutional accreditation and accreditation of undergraduate and graduate careers and study programs to the MINEDUC;
(iii) maintaining public 


 63

   

information
systems that contain relevant decisions regarding the different accreditation processes; (iv) executing and promoting actions for continuous improvement of the quality of higher
education institutions; (v) keeping a registry of peer reviewers who are part of the accreditation process; (vi) training peer reviewers; and (vii) submitting data to the National
Higher Education Information System. 
Under
the National System of Quality Assurance of Higher Education, institutional accreditation would be mandatory for all autonomous higher education institutions and would consist of the evaluation
and verification of compliance with quality standards, as well as the analysis of internal mechanisms for quality assurance, considering both their existence and their application and results, and
their alignment with the mission and purpose of higher education institutions. All institutional accreditations would last for eight years. The accreditation process would include the evaluation, for
all campuses and for the undergraduate careers and programs selected by the board of the Higher Education Quality Council, of the management and institutional resources, internal quality assurance,
teaching and results of the education process, generation of knowledge, creation and innovation, and association with the environment, of the respective higher educational institutions. Accredited
institutions would be classified under one of three different categories. Category C institutions would need to obtain prior approval of the Higher Education Quality Council to open new
campuses or programs, while Category B institutions would need to obtain such approval only to open careers or programs in a field of knowledge not regularly offered by the institution or which
has not been offered in the last two years, and Category A institutions would not need to obtain any approval to open new campuses, careers or programs. 
The
bill also provides that certain careers and study programs, i.e., medical and education programs, as well as doctorate-level programs be mandatorily accredited. 
Accreditation
decisions would not be appealable although reconsideration could be sought before the Higher Education Quality Council not later than 15 days after the notification of decision. 


(5)The
creation of a Superintendence of Higher Education, whose purpose is to enforce and monitor compliance with the legal and regulatory provisions that govern higher
education, as well as the legality of the use of resources by higher education institutions and to supervise their financial feasibility. Its functions and powers would be, among others, to:
(i) enforce compliance with the law by higher education institutions, their organizers, controllers, members, associates, partners, owners, founders, legal representatives and board members;
(ii) ensure that the requirements or conditions that resulted in official recognition of the higher education institutions are maintained; (iii) supervise the financial feasibility of
higher education institutions; (iv) ensure the legality of the use of resources of higher education institutions; (v) ensure that higher education institutions comply with the terms,
conditions, and modalities of the academic commitments undertaken with students; (vi) arrange and conduct audits of higher education institutions; (vii) visit the academic and
administrative establishments and offices of higher education institutions and of the institutions' organizers that are related to the management of the respective institution in order to carry out
the functions assigned to the Superintendence, accessing any documents, books or information required for the purposes of enforcement, and reviewing all the transactions, assets, books, accounts,
files and, in general, any documents or information it deems necessary for the supervision of the individuals or institutions inspected and of the third parties with which they interact;
(viii) require pertinent information needed for it to fulfill its duties to be provided to it by inspectors and inspecting institutions and related third parties, and by any relevant government
entities; (ix) summon organizers, controllers, members, associates, partners, owners, founders, legal representatives, board members or employees of the inspected 

 64

   

institutions,
or of those who exercise those positions at related institutions, and any other person who has entered into an agreements of any kind with the above, to testify before it, and summon
witnesses to provide any information it deems necessary to fulfill its duties; (x) respond to inquiries submitted to it within the scope of its powers, receive and resolve claims, and mediate
claims, when applicable; (xi) investigate and resolve complaints that arise; (xii) bring charges, process them, adopt provisional measures, and resolve the proceedings underway regarding
any infraction that comes to its attention; (xiii) apply penalties in accordance with the law; (xiv) apply and provide administrative interpretations of the applicable law, and issue
general instructions to the sector subject to its enforcement; (xv) send information brought to its attention in the exercise of its duties and powers to the Higher Education Quality Council
when such information indicates violations within the scope of the matters it regulates; (xvi) remit information brought to its attention in the exercise of its duties to the Public Prosecutor
when such information indicates that a crime has been committed; (xvii) manage the information it compiles in the exercise of its duties, in a coordinated effort with the Undersecretary of
Higher Education, for adequate development of the National Higher Education Information System; (xviii) reach agreements with other public services regarding electronic transfers of information
to facilitate execution of their functions; (xix) generate indexes, statistics and studies with the information delivered by the institutions it inspects, and produce publications within the
scope of its powers; and (xx) provide technical advisory services to the MINEDUC and other entities within the scope of its powers. 
Sanctions
imposed by the Superintendence of Higher Education would be appealable to the courts. 
Higher
education institutions would be required to provide to the Superintendence of Higher Education the following information: (i) their audited consolidated annual financial statements and
any information about any fact that may significantly affect its financial condition; (ii) a list of their partners or members, and of any individuals exercising executive functions;
(iii) information about related party transactions; (iv) information about tax-exempt donations; and (v) a list of entities in which the institution holds an interest of more than
10% and of not-for-profit entities in which it is entitled to appoint at least one board member. 


(6)New
regulations applicable to not-for-profit educational institutions (including universities) that would: (i) provide that their controllers and members can
only be individuals, other not-for-profits or state-owned entities; (ii) create the obligation to use their resources and reinvest their surplus or profits in the pursuit of their objectives
and in enhancing the quality of the education they provide; (iii) create the obligation to have a board of directors, which cannot delegate its functions, and whose members cannot be removed
unless approved by the majority of the board and for serious reasons; and (iv) prohibit related party transactions with their founders, controllers, members of the board, rector and their
relatives or related entities, unless the counterparty to the transaction is another not-for-profit entity, and establish regulations for other related party transactions which include the need for
them to be under market conditions and approved by the board.
(7)A
new system to provide public funding to higher education institutions and free higher education to certain students. Under the new system, all licensed higher
education institutions would be eligible to receive public "institutional funding for gratuity" as long as they complied with the following requirements: (i) accreditation;
(ii) not-for-profit or state-owned; (iii) be part of the Common Access System for Higher Education Institutions; and (iv) apply policies approved by the Undersecretary of Higher
Education that permit fair student access and implement vulnerable student support programs that promote their retention, providing that at least 20% of the total admissions of the university are
granted to students from homes within the country's four lowest-income deciles. The institutions that would be part of the public funding system would be subject to regulation of fees charged which
would be set by the Undersecretary of Higher Education.

        We are currently evaluating the effect the proposed Higher Education Bill would have on the Chilean institutions in the Laureate International Universities network if it is adopted in the form introduced in the Chilean Congress. We cannot predict whether or not the proposed Higher Education Bill will be adopted in this form, or if any higher education legislation will be adopted that would affect the institutions in the Laureate International Universities network. However, if any such legislation is adopted, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
         In June 2012, an investigative committee of the Chilean Chamber of Deputies issued a preliminary report on the Chilean higher education system alleging that certain universities, including the three universities that Laureate controls in Chile, have not complied with the requirements of Chilean law that universities be not-for-profit. Among the irregularities cited in the report are high salaries to board members or top executives, outsourcing of services to related parties, and that universities are being bought and sold by foreign and economic groups. The investigative committee referred its report to the MINEDUC and to the Public Prosecutor of Chile to determine whether there has been any violation of the law. The Public Prosecutor appointed a regional prosecutor to investigate whether any criminal charges should be brought for alleged violations of the laws on higher education and, more than three years later, no charges have been brought by the regional prosecutor against any institutions in the Laureate International Universities network. On July 19, 2012, the Chilean Chamber of Deputies rejected the report of the investigative committee. In December 2012, in light of the criminal prosecution of the former president of the National Accreditation Commission for alleged bribery, the Chilean Chamber of Deputies mandated its Education Commission to be an investigative committee regarding the functioning of the National Accreditation Commission, especially with respect to compliance with the National Accreditation Commission's duty to oversee higher education entities. The Education Commission delivered a report, which was approved by the Chamber of Deputies on October 1, 2013, containing several recommendations to improve regulation of the higher education accreditation system. Additionally, the Chilean Chamber of Deputies approved the creation of a special investigative committee to resume the investigation of higher education performed by the investigative committee that issued the June 2012 report that was previously rejected by the Chamber of Deputies. On January 15, 2014, that investigative committee approved a new report recommending, among other things, improvements to the Chilean higher education system regulations, amendments to the higher education financing system, particularly the CAE Program, imposition of criminal penalties for violation of the requirement that universities be not-for-profit, and support of legislation that would prohibit related party transactions, prohibit the transfer of control of universities, and require universities to have independent board members. The report was approved by the full Chamber of Deputies on April 1, 2014. 
         On February 18, 2014, the MINEDUC disclosed that on November 15, 2013 and February 11, 2014, it had initiated internal investigations into UDLA Chile and UNAB, respectively. The investigations were initiated upon referrals from the National Education Council and the National Accreditation Commission, which had conveyed to the MINEDUC their concerns regarding certain agreements entered into by UDLA Chile and UNAB with their controlling entities, including concerns about the amount and real use made by the universities of the services provided under those agreements. The investigations are an initial step by the MINEDUC to determine whether the Ministry should begin formal sanction proceedings against the universities. The MINEDUC also disclosed that it had delivered relevant documentation on the matter to the Public Prosecutor. In January 2016, the MINEDUC announced that it had closed the investigation into UNAB. 
         In May 2014, Servicio de Impuestos Internos Chile ("SII") instituted an audit of UVM Chile, UNAB and UDLA Chile questioning whether they had regularly paid their taxes as non-profit entities for the period 2011 to 2014, specifically in relation to their financial dealings with Laureate, for-profit entities. Any non-compliance with the non-profit laws would subject them to the payment of additional taxes and penalties. As of August 2015, SII had notified all three institutions that its audit detected "no 
 66

   differences" in the taxes paid and the taxes owed, and provided a written closure letter to each of the institutions. In December 2016, SII notified separately UDLA Chile and UNAB that as part of the general audit program called "Auditoría Integral a Universidades," it was requesting supporting documentation from them for the tax periods between November 2013 and October 2016. On March 21, 2017, SII sent a similar notification to UVM Chile regarding the tax periods from May 2014 to October 2016. Each institution will submit responsive documents that support taxes paid related to its revenues and expenses, including to the extent such revenues and expenses involve financial dealings with Laureate for-profit entities. 
         In June 2016, the MINEDUC notified UNAB that it was opening an investigation into possible violations of the not-for-profit nature of UNAB. In September 2016, the MINEDUC notified UVM Chile that it was opening a similar investigation of UVM Chile. Each of the institutions continues to be responsive to the MINEDUC's requests as part of these investigations. Each investigation will be conducted by an investigator appointed by the MINEDUC under the Provisional Administrator Law, and both UNAB and UVM Chile have been advised that the investigations will last at least six months. Procedural safeguards in the investigation process include notice, the right to present written statements and evidence, and the requirement that the decision be based on the formal record. Under the Provisional Administrator Law, at the end of the investigation the MINEDUC can either close the investigation or issue a report imposing one of the following measures: (i) ordering a recovery plan for the investigated institution, should the MINEDUC verify severe breaches of the institution's financial, administrative, labor or academic commitments; (ii) with the prior consent of the National Education Council, naming a provisional administrator for the institution if the MINEDUC determines that (a) there are serious risks to the administrative or financial viability of the institution that may affect the continuity of its educational programs, (b) there are serious and recurring breaches of the academic commitments of the institution to its students due to a lack of educational or teaching resources available to grant professional or technical degrees, (c) it is impossible for the institution to maintain its academic functions due to sanctions, injunctions or foreclosures affecting the institution, its campuses or its assets, (d) the institution is declared bankrupt or (e) a recovery plan pursuant to (i) above has not been presented, has been rejected or has been breached by the institution; or (iii) initiating a process to revoke the institution's license, in which case it would name a closing administrator. If the MINEDUC were to impose any sanctions, UNAB or UVM Chile, as the case may be, would have several routes to appeal or challenge that decision, both within the MINEDUC and in the courts or other governmental bodies. UNAB and UVM Chile are cooperating with the investigation. 
   Mexican Regulation 
         Mexican law provides that private entities are entitled to render education services in accordance with applicable legal provisions. These provisions regulate the education services rendered by the federal government, the states and private entities and contain guidelines for the allocation of the higher education role among the federal government, the states and the municipalities, including their respective economic contributions in order to jointly participate in the development and coordination of higher education. 
         There are three levels of regulation in Mexico: federal; state; and municipal. The federal authority is the Federal Ministry of Public Education (Secretaría de Educación Pública). Each of the 31 states and Mexico City has the right to establish a local Ministry of Education, and each municipality of each state may establish a municipal education authority that only has authority to advertise and promote educational services and/or activities. Additionally, since February 26, 2013, the National Institute for the Evaluation of Educational Services (Instituto Nacional para la Evaluación de la Educación) is in charge of, among other things, evaluating the quality of the study plans and programs for Basic and Mid-Superior education services (as further described below). 
 67

           Some functions are exclusive to the Federal Ministry of Education such as the establishment of study plans and programs for Basic and Mid-Superior education services Other functions are exclusive to the state Ministries of Education such as the coordination and administration of the local registry of students, teachers, education institutions and schools. There are also concurrent functions such as the granting and withdrawal of governmental recognition of validity of studies (Reconocimiento de Validez Oficial de Estudios) ("REVOEs," for its acronym in Spanish). 
         The General Law on Education (Ley General de Educación) in Mexico classifies studies in the following three categories: (i) Basic Education, which includes pre-school (kindergarten), elementary school and junior high school (secundaria); (ii) Mid-Superior Education, which includes high school (prepataroria) and equivalent studies, as well as professional education that does not consider  preparatoria as a prerequisite; and (iii) Superior Education, which includes the studies taught after  prepataroria, including undergraduate school (licenciatura), specialties (especialidades), masters studies, doctorate studies and studies for teachers (educación normal). 
         The General Law on Education provides that in order for private entities to be able to provide Basic Education Services and studies for teachers (educación normal), a prior governmental authorization is required (the "Authorization"). For other studies, including Mid-Superior and Superior Education Services, no prior governmental authorization is required. However, if the private entities desire to provide Mid-Superior and Superior Education Services, and want those studies to be integrated into the federal and/or local public educational system, they must obtain a REVOE by the federal and/or local Ministry of Education, respectively. 
         The REVOEs are issued by the Federal Ministry of Education under the General Law on Education, or by any of the state Ministries of Education under the applicable state law. REVOEs are granted for each program taught in each campus. If there is a change in the program or in the campus in which it is taught, the entity will need to get a new REVOE. 
         The Federal Ministry of Education has issued a set of general resolutions (Acuerdos) that regulate the general requirements for obtaining REVOEs. The main Acuerdos are (i) Acuerdo 243 issued on May 27, 1998 to set the general guidelines for obtaining an Authorization or REVOE, and (ii) Acuerdo 279 issued on July 10, 2000 to set the procedures related to REVOEs for Superior Education studies. The Federal Ministry of Education recommends to the local Ministries of Education the adoption and inclusion of the provisions contained in  Acuerdo 243 and Acuerdo 279 in the local Law on Education and other applicable local laws and regulations. 
         In general terms, federal and state laws in Mexico provide for three requirements for granting REVOEs:
 

 personnel that have adequate qualifications to render education services and that comply with the appropriate administrative requirements; 
 facilities that meet the hygiene, security and pedagogic conditions determined by the authority; and 
 studies, plans and programs that the authority considers appropriate. 

         Depending on each state, other requirements may apply, for example, that private institutions that provide educational services with REVOEs need to be registered with the corresponding local authorities. 
         Acuerdo 279 regulates in detail the provisions contained under the General Law on Education to grant REVOEs for Superior Education studies, regarding faculty, plans and programs of studies, inspection visits, procedures, etc. Acuerdo 279 provides that the faculty that participate in programs taught by private institutions must be full-time faculty or faculty retained by subject. Acuerdo 279 regulates the qualifications that the faculty members have to meet depending on whether they are 
 68

   full-time or part-time, and provides that a minimum percentage of courses need to be taught by full-time faculty, which percentage depends on the type of program taught. 
         Acuerdo 279 also provides that private institutions that provide Superior Education services in accordance with presidential decrees or secretarial resolutions (acuerdos secretariales) issued specifically to them may maintain the obligations provided to them thereunder and may function under the provisions of Acuerdo 279 to the extent the provisions of this latter Acuerdo benefit them. Currently, Universidad Tecnológica de México, S.C. and Universidad del Valle de México, S.C. have secretarial resolutions that were issued in their favor before the issuance of Acuerdo 279. The obligations contained in these secretarial resolutions generally conform to the obligations provided under Acuerdo 279. 
         The regulatory authorities are entitled to conduct inspection visits to the facilities of educational institutions to verify compliance with applicable legal provisions. Failure to comply with applicable legal provisions may result in the imposition of fines, in the cancellation of the applicable REVOE and in the closure of the education facilities. 
         Private institutions with REVOEs are required to grant a minimum percentage of scholarships to students. Acuerdo 279 provides that private institutions grant scholarships to at least five percent of the total students registered during each academic term. Scholarships consist, in whole or in part, of payment of the registration and tuition fees established by the educational institution. The granting of scholarships has to be provided for in the internal regulations of the educational institution, which regulations must provide:
 

 authority of the institution that will coordinate the application and supervision of the compliance with the applicable provisions; 
 terms and procedures for the expedition and dissemination of the scholarships grant; 
 requirements with which the applicants of scholarships will have to comply; 
 types of scholarships offered; 
 procedures for the delivery of results; and 
 conditions to maintain and to cancel scholarships. 

         Acuerdo 279 provides for the minimum percentage of courses that must be taught by full-time faculty. Private education institutions that do not meet the minimum requirements must submit to the education authority, for approval, a detailed justification in that regard making reference to the area of knowledge of the plan of studies, level thereof, education mode, general purpose of the plan and educational model proposed for the referenced studies. In addition, for masters studies focused in research, the university must have at least one full-time active investigator for every 25 students and for doctorate studies, must have at least one full-time active investigator for every ten students. 
         Private entities may also obtain the recognition of validity of their programs from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México or "UNAM"). The General Regulations of Incorporation and Validation of Studies issued by UNAM provide that programs followed in private entities may be "incorporated" to UNAM in order for UNAM to recognize their validity. For the programs to be incorporated the following general requirements must be met:
 

 they have to be complete cycles and not isolated subjects; 
 the private entity must have appropriate infrastructure (workshops, laboratories, libraries, etc.); 
 the private entity must have professors, study plans, programs and other academic elements approved by UNAM; and 

 69

   

 the private entity must be subject to the inspection and surveillance of UNAM and pay the corresponding fees. 

         The UNAM regulations also provide that private entities incorporated to UNAM must grant scholarships to at least five percent of the total students registered in such entity. These scholarships shall consist of the exemption in whole of payment of the registration and tuition fees established by the educational entity. The students entitled to have this benefit will be selected by UNAM. Some of our high school programs and one of our medical programs are incorporated to UVM Mexico. 
   Peruvian Regulation 
         We operate four post-secondary education institutions in Peru, two of which are universities and two of which are technical-vocational institutes. Peruvian law provides that universities and technical-vocational institutes can be operated as public or private entities, and that the private entities may be organized for profit. The Ministry of Education has overall responsibility for the national education system. 
         In 2014, the Peruvian Congress enacted a new University Law to regulate the establishment, operation, monitoring and closure of universities. The law also promotes continuous improvement of quality at Peruvian universities. The law created a new agency, the Superintendencia de Educación Superior Universitaria ("SUNEDU"), which is responsible for carrying out the governmental role in university regulation, including ensuring quality. While institutional autonomy is still recognized, and universities are permitted to create their own internal governance rules and determine their own academic, management and economic systems, including curriculum design and entrance and graduation requirements, all of these matters are now subject to review and evaluation by SUNEDU through its periodic review of universities as part of a license renewal process. 
         Under the new law, university licenses are temporary but renewable, and will be granted by SUNEDU for a maximum of six years. On November 24, 2015 the Board of SUNEDU promulgated regulations for the university licensing process. For licenses to be renewed, universities will have to demonstrate to SUNEDU that it comply with, at a minimum, certain Basic Quality Conditions ("BQCs") (i.e., that they have specified academic goals and that the degrees granted and plans of study are aligned with those goals, that their academic offerings are compatible with their planning goals, (e.g., there is sufficient labor demand for careers offered) that there are only two regular semesters of studies per year, that they have appropriate infrastructure and equipment, that they engage in research, that they have a sufficient supply of qualified teachers, at least 25% of whom will need to be full-time, that they supply adequate basic complementary educational services (e.g., medical and psychological services and sports activities), that they provide appropriate placement office services, and that they have transparency of institutional information). The relicensing process started on December 15, 2015 and will end on December 31, 2017 and is divided by groups. UPC and UPN have been included in Group 5, the review process for which will start in early 2017, although universities are permitted to apply earlier than their scheduled time. UPN applied early in July 2016, while UPC has until February 2017 to file. The review committee of SUNEDU will issue a license at the end of the relicensing process or, alternatively, not issue a license and provide for a remediation period if one or more of the BQCs are not, in its opinion, satisfied. Following a one-year period, SUNEDU will make a new verification visit after the university has presented and implemented its remediation plan. 
         Technical-vocational institutes are regulated by the Ministry of Education, which grants operating licenses for not less than three nor more than six years, after which the Ministry conducts a revalidation process. The approval of new institute licenses is based on the evaluation by the Ministry of the institute's institutional goals, the curricula of its education programs and their link with careers needed in the Peruvian economy, the availability of adequate qualified teachers, the institute's infrastructure, the institute's financial resources, and the favorable opinion of the National System of 
 70

   Assessment, Accreditation and Certification of Education Quality ("SINEACES") regarding the appropriateness of the programs the institute is offering. SINEACES is also responsible for the accreditation of programs and careers at all higher education institutions. On November 2, 2016 a new law regarding technical-vocational institutes (the "Institutes Law") was enacted. Regulations are expected to be issued within 120 days from the date of passage. Under the Institutes Law, technical-vocational institutes are regulated by the Ministry of Education, which grants operating licenses. The Institutes Law has created two types of institutes, Higher Education Institutes ("Institutes") and Higher Education Colleges ("Colleges"). Institutes are dedicated to technical careers and Colleges are devoted to technical careers related to education as well as science and information Technology. Colleges grant Technical Bachelor Degrees and Professional Technical Degrees. The scope of such degrees will be defined more completely by the implementing regulations. Institutes and Colleges are subject to a mandatory license granted by the Ministry of Education, based on an evaluation to determine compliance with BQCs. BQCs include: an appropriate institutional management guaranteeing a proper relation with the educational model of the institution; appropriate academic management and proper program studies aligned with the Ministry of Education norms; appropriate infrastructure and equipment to develop educational activities; adequate teachers and staff which, at a minimum, should consist of 20% full-time staff; and appropriate financial and economic provisions. The licensing process of institutes is still to be determined by the regulations. However, the Law provides that the process will last no more than 90 days and will grant a license for a five-year period to be renewed once expired. Unlike licenses, quality accreditation is voluntary except for certain careers for which it might be mandatory as determined by law. Such accreditation will be taken into consideration for access to public grants for scholarships and research among other things. Private Institutes and Colleges may be organized as for-profit or not-for-profit entities under Peruvian law. Not-for-profit Colleges' and Institutes' income is exempt from taxes on their educational activities. For-profit Colleges and Institutes are subject to income taxes, but may qualify for a tax credit on 30% of their reinvested income, subject to a reinvestment program to be filed with the Ministry of Education for a maximum term of five years. The specific requirements of such programs are still to be determined by the regulations. 
         There was a Presidential election in Peru during the second quarter of 2016, and the new President entered into office at the end of July 2016. In December 2016, the new President appointed a new Minister of Education following the impeachment by the Peruvian Congress of the prior Minister of Education. We do not expect any changes in policy as a result of the appointment of the new Minister of Education. 
   Turkish Regulation and Internal Investigation 
         Through our European segment, we operate Istanbul Bilgi University, a network institution located in Turkey that consolidates under the variable interest entity model. Istanbul Bilgi University is established as a "Foundation High Education Institution" (a "Foundation University") under the Turkish higher education law, sponsored by an educational foundation (the "the Bilgi Foundation"). As such, it is subject to regulation, supervision and inspection by the Turkish Higher Education Council (the "YÖK"). In 2014, the Turkish parliament amended the higher education law to provide expanded authority to the YÖK with respect to Foundation Universities, including authorizing additional remedies for violations of the higher education law and of regulations adopted by the YÖK. On November 19, 2015, the YÖK promulgated an "Ordinance Concerned with Amendment to Foundation High Education Institutions" (the "Ordinance") the principal effects of which relate to the supervision and inspection of Foundation Universities by the YÖK. Under the Ordinance, the YÖK has expanded authority to inspect accounts, transactions, activities and assets of Foundation Universities, as well as their academic units, programs, projects and subjects. The Ordinance establishes a progressive series of five remedies that the YÖK can take in the event it finds a violation of the Ordinance, ranging from (1) a warning and request for correction to (2) the suspension of the Foundation University's ability to establish new academic units or programs to (3) limiting the number of students the Foundation 
 71

   University can admit, including ceasing new admissions, to (4) provisional suspension of the Foundation University's license to (5) cancellation of the Foundation University's license. Since the promulgation of the Ordinance, the YÖK has cancelled the licenses of 15 Foundation Universities. 
         The Ordinance specifies that Foundation Universities cannot be established by foundations in order to gain profit for themselves, and prohibits specified types of fund transfers from Foundation Universities to their sponsoring foundation, with certain exceptions for payments made under contractual arrangements for various goods and services that are provided at or below current market rates. Istanbul Bilgi University has entered into contractual arrangements with a subsidiary of Laureate that is a member of the board of trustees of the Bilgi Foundation, and has affiliates that are also members of that board, to provide Istanbul Bilgi University with management, operational and student services and certain intellectual property at fair market rates. The YÖK conducts annual audits of the operations of Istanbul Bilgi University and currently is in the process of completing its most recent audit. If the YÖK were to determine that any of these contracts or the payments made by Istanbul Bilgi University to this Laureate subsidiary, or any other activities of Istanbul Bilgi University, including, as further described below, the donation of 40.0 million Turkish Liras made by the university to a charitable foundation that was subsequently reimbursed to the university by certain Laureate-owned entities, violate the Ordinance or other applicable law, the YÖK could take actions against Istanbul Bilgi University up to and including cancellation of its license. Further, if the YÖK were to determine that any administrators of Istanbul Bilgi University have directly taken any actions or supported any activities that are intended to harm the integrity of the state, the license of the university could be cancelled. In July 2016, a coup attempt increased political instability in Turkey, and the uncertainties arising from the failed coup in Turkey could lead to changes in laws affecting Istanbul Bilgi University or result in modifications to the current interpretations and enforcement of the Ordinance or other laws and regulations by the YÖK. 
         As previously disclosed, during the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded an operating expense of $18.0 million (the value of 40.0 million Turkish Liras at the date of donation) for a donation by our network institution in Turkey to a charitable foundation. We believed the donation was encouraged by the Turkish government to further a public project supported by the government and expected that it would enhance the position and ongoing operations of our institution in Turkey. The Company has learned that the charitable foundation which received the donation disbursed the funds at the direction of a former senior executive at our network institution in Turkey and other external individuals to a third party without our knowledge or approval. 
         In June 2016, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors initiated an internal investigation into this matter with the assistance of external counsel. The investigation concerns the facts surrounding the donation, violations of the Company's policies, and possible violations of the FCPA and other applicable laws in what appears to be a fraud perpetrated by the former senior executive at our network institution in Turkey and other external individuals. This includes an investigation to determine if the diversion was part of a scheme to misappropriate the funds and whether any portion of the funds was paid to government officials. We have not identified that any other officers or employees outside of Turkey were involved in the diversion of the intended donation. Although we are pursuing efforts to recover the diverted funds, including through legal proceedings, there is no assurance that we will be successful. 
         We have been advised by Turkish counsel that, under Turkish law, a Foundation University may not make payments that cause a decrease in the university's wealth or do not otherwise benefit the university. Given the uncertainty of recovery of the diverted donation and to mitigate any potential regulatory issues in Turkey relating to the donation, certain Laureate-owned entities that are members of the foundation that controls our network institution in Turkey have contributed an amount of approximately $13.0 million (the value of 40.0 million Turkish Liras on November 4, 2016, the date of contribution) to our network institution in Turkey to reimburse it for the donation. 
 72

           As a result of the investigation, which is ongoing, we took steps to remove the former senior executive at our network institution in Turkey. Because of the complex organizational structure in Turkey, this took approximately one month and during that period our access to certain aspects of the business including the financial and other records of the university was interrupted. The former senior executive is now no longer affiliated with our network institution and we again have access to the financial and other records of the university. 
         In September 2016, we voluntarily disclosed the investigation to the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") and the SEC. The Company is fully cooperating with these agencies in their investigations and inquiries relating to this matter. The Company has internal controls and compliance policies and procedures that are designed to prevent misconduct of this nature and support compliance with laws and best practices throughout its global operations. The Company is taking steps to enhance these internal controls and compliance policies and procedures. The investigations relating to the donation are ongoing, and we cannot predict the outcome at this time, or the impact, if any, to the Company's consolidated financial statements or predict how the resulting consequences, if any, may impact our internal controls and compliance policies and procedures, business, ability or right to operate in Turkey, results of operations or financial position. If we are found to have violated the FCPA or other laws applicable to us, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. 
         See "Item 1ARisk FactorsRisks Relating to Our BusinessWe currently have four material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that, if not corrected, could result in material misstatements of our financial statements" and "Item 1ARisk FactorsRisks Relating to Our BusinessOur institutions are subject to uncertain and varying laws and regulations, and any changes to these laws or regulations or their application to us may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and result of operations." 
   U.S. Regulation 
         Our institutions in the United States are subject to extensive regulation by the DOE, accrediting agencies and state educational agencies. The regulations, standards and policies of these agencies cover substantially all of our U.S. Institutions' operations, including their educational programs, facilities, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, finances, results of operations and financial condition. 
         As institutions of higher education that grants degrees and diplomas, our U.S. Institutions are required to be authorized by appropriate state educational agencies. In addition, the DOE regulates our U.S. Institutions due to their participation in federal student financial aid programs under Title IV of the HEA, or Title IV programs. Title IV programs currently include grants and educational loans provided directly by the federal government, including loans to students and parents through the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (the "Direct Loan Program"). The Direct Loan Program offers Federal Stafford Loans, Federal Parent PLUS Loans, Federal Grad PLUS Loans and Federal Consolidation Loans. Prior to July 1, 2010, Title IV programs also included educational loans issued by private banks with below-market interest rates that are guaranteed by the federal government in the event of a student's default on repaying the loan. A significant percentage of students at our U.S. Institutions rely on the availability of Title IV programs to finance their cost of attendance. 
 73

          
        To participate in Title IV programs, our U.S. Institutions are required to both maintain authorization by the appropriate state educational agency or agencies and be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the DOE. The HEA requires accrediting agencies recognized by the DOE to review and monitor many aspects of an institution's operations and to take appropriate action if the institution fails to meet the accrediting agency's standards. 
         We plan and implement our business activities to comply with the standards of these regulatory agencies. To monitor compliance with this regulatory environment, institutions participating in Title IV programs undergo periodic reviews to demonstrate, among other things, that they maintain proper accreditation, state authorization, and adequate financial resources. Historically, our U.S. Institutions have maintained eligibility to access Title IV funding. 
   State Education Licensure and Regulation 
         Our U.S. Institutions are required by the HEA to be authorized by applicable state educational agencies in the states where we are located to participate in Title IV programs. To maintain requisite state authorizations, our U.S. Institutions are required to continuously meet standards relating to, among other things, educational programs, facilities, instructional and administrative staff, marketing and recruitment, financial operations, addition of new locations and educational programs and various operational and administrative procedures. These standards can be different than and conflict with the requirements of the DOE and other applicable regulatory bodies. State laws and regulations may limit our ability to offer educational programs and offer certain degrees. Some states may also prescribe financial regulations that are different from those of the DOE and many require the posting of surety bonds. Failure to comply with the requirements of applicable state educational agencies could result in us losing our authorization to offer educational programs in those states. If that were to occur, the applicable state educational agency could force us to cease operations in their state. Even if the applicable state educational agency does not require an institution to cease operations on an immediate basis, the loss of authorization by that state educational agency would then cause our institution in such state to lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, and such loss of Title IV program eligibility could force that institution to cease operations in such state. Alternatively, the state educational licensing agencies could restrict the institution's ability to offer certain degree or diploma programs. We may also be subject to review by applicable state educational agencies or associations. 
         Each of our U.S. Institutions maintains an authorization from the pertinent state regulatory authority in which such institutions are physically located, or is exempt under current state law from a requirement to be specifically authorized. If any of the authorizations provided to one or more of our U.S. Institutions are determined not to comply with the DOE regulations, or one or more of our U.S. Institutions is unable to obtain or maintain an authorization that satisfies the DOE requirements, students at the pertinent institution may be unable to access Title IV funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations in the United States. 
         On December 19, 2016, the DOE published final regulations regarding state authorization for programs offered through distance education and state authorization for foreign locations of institutions. Among other provisions, these final regulations require that an institution participating in the Title IV federal student aid programs and offering postsecondary education through distance education be authorized by each state in which the institution enrolls students, if such authorization is required by the state. The DOE would recognize authorization through participation in a state authorization reciprocity agreement, if the agreement does not prevent a state from enforcing its own laws. The final regulations also require that foreign additional locations and branch campuses be authorized by the appropriate foreign government agency and, if at least 50% of a program can be completed at the location/branch, be approved by the institution's accrediting agency and be reported to the state where the main campus is located. The final regulations would also require institutions to: 
 74

   document the state process for resolving complaints from students enrolled in programs offered through distance education or correspondence courses; and make certain public and individualized disclosures to enrolled and prospective students about their distance education programs. These final regulations are effective July 1, 2018. 
         Independent of this matter of federal regulation, several states have asserted jurisdiction over educational institutions offering online degree programs that have no physical location or other presence in the state, but that have some activity in the state, such as enrolling or offering educational services to students who reside in the state, conducting practica or sponsoring internships in the state, employing faculty who reside in the state or advertising to or recruiting prospective students in the state. Thus, our activities in certain states constitute a presence requiring licensure or authorization under requirements of state law, regulation or policy of the state educational agency, even though we do not have a physical facility in such states. Therefore, in addition to the states where we maintain physical facilities, we have obtained, or are in the process of obtaining, approvals or exemptions that we believe are necessary in connection with our activities that may constitute a presence in such states requiring licensure or authorization by the state educational agency based on the laws, rules or regulations of that state. Some of our approvals are pending or are in the renewal process. St. Augustine does not have current approvals or exemptions from the state educational agencies of twelve states in which St. Augustine does not maintain physical locations but has enrolled a small number of students. For each such state, St. Augustine is either in the process of applying for such approval/exemption or has plans to submit such applications in 2017. In recent years, several states have voluntarily entered into State Authorization Reciprocity Arrangements ("SARA") that establish standards for interstate offering of postsecondary distance education courses and programs. If an institution's home state participates in SARA and authorizes the institution to provide distance education in accordance with SARA standards, then the institution need not obtain additional authorizations for distance education from any other SARA member state. None of our U.S. Institutions participate in SARA. 
         Notwithstanding our efforts to obtain approvals or exemptions, state regulatory requirements for online education vary among the states, are not well developed in many states, are imprecise or unclear in some states and can change frequently. Because our U.S. Institutions enroll students in online degree programs, we expect that regulatory authorities in other states where we are not currently licensed or authorized may request that we seek additional licenses or authorizations for these institutions in their states in the future. If any of our U.S. Institutions fails to comply with state licensing or authorization requirements for a state, or fails to obtain licenses or authorizations when required, that institution could lose its state licensure or authorization by that state, which could prohibit it from recruiting prospective students or offering services to current students in that state. We could also be subject to other sanctions, including restrictions on activities in that state, fines and penalties. We review the licensure requirements of other states when we believe that it is appropriate to determine whether our activities in those states may constitute a presence or otherwise may require licensure or authorization by the respective state education agencies. In addition, state laws and regulations may limit our ability to offer educational programs and to award degrees and may limit the ability of our students to sit for certification exams in their chosen fields of study. New laws, regulations or interpretations related to offering educational programs online could increase our cost of doing business and affect our ability to recruit students in particular states, which could, in turn, adversely affect our U.S. Institutions' enrollments and revenues and have a material adverse effect on our business. 
         We also are subject to extensive state laws and regulations, including standards for instruction, qualifications of faculty, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations and other operational matters. In recent years, the proprietary education industry has experienced broad-based, intensifying scrutiny in the form of increased investigations and enforcement actions. In October 2014, 
 75

   the DOE announced an interagency task force composed of the DOE, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), the U.S. Departments of Justice, Treasury and Veterans Affairs, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the "CFPB"), the SEC, and numerous state attorneys general. Attorneys general in several states have become more active in enforcing consumer protection laws, especially related to recruiting practices and the financing of education at proprietary educational institutions. In addition, several state attorneys general have recently partnered with the CFPB to review industry practices. The FTC has also recently issued civil investigative demands to several other U.S. proprietary educational institutions, which require the institutions to provide documents and information related to the advertising, marketing, or sale of secondary or postsecondary educational products or services, or educational accreditation products or services. If our past or current business practices are found to violate applicable consumer protection laws, or if we are found to have made misrepresentations to our current or prospective students about our educational programs, we could be subject to monetary fines or penalties and possible limitations on the manner in which we conduct our business, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. To the extent that more states or government agencies commence investigations, act in concert, or direct their focus on our U.S. Institutions, the cost of responding to these inquiries and investigations could increase significantly, and the potential impact on our business would be substantially greater. 
         In addition to state or government agency actions, we are subject to litigation and complaints to state educational agencies by current and former students alleging violations of state consumer protection laws. See "Item 3Legal Proceedings" for more information regarding student litigation matters. On September 8, 2016, the Minnesota Office of Higher Education ("MOHE") sent to Walden University an information request regarding its doctoral programs and complaints filed by doctoral students, as part of a program review that MOHE is conducting. We have been informed by MOHE that in an effort to better understand the context, background and issues related to doctoral student complaints in Minnesota, MOHE is initiating a full review of doctoral programs for institutions registered in Minnesota. 
   State Professional Licensure 
         Many states have specific licensure requirements that an individual must satisfy to be licensed as a professional in specified fields, including fields such as education and healthcare. These requirements vary by state and by field. A student's success in obtaining licensure following graduation typically depends on several factors, including but not limited to: the background and qualifications of the individual graduate; whether the institution and the program were approved by the state in which the graduate seeks licensure; whether the program from which the student graduated meets all requirements for professional licensure in that state; whether the institution and the program are accredited and, if so, by what accrediting agencies; and whether the institution's degrees are recognized by other states in which a student may seek to work. Several states also require that graduates pass a state test or examination as a prerequisite to becoming certified in certain fields, such as teaching and nursing. In several states, an educational program must be approved by a professional association in order for graduates to be licensed in that professional field. In the field of psychology, an increasing number of states require approval by either the American Psychological Association ("APA") or the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards ("ASPPB"). To date, Walden University has been unable to obtain approval of its Ph.D. program in Counseling Psychology from the ASPPB or APA. Additionally, states often require a criminal background clearance before granting certain professional licensures or certifications. The catalogs for our U.S. Institutions inform students that it is incumbent upon the student to verify whether a specific criminal background clearance is required in their field of study prior to beginning course work. 
 76

           Additionally, under the HEA, proprietary schools generally are eligible to participate in Title IV programs in respect of educational programs that lead to "gainful employment in a recognized occupation." As part of regulations promulgated by the DOE to more specifically define "gainful employment," which became effective on July 1, 2015 and are described in more detail below, the DOE requires each of our U.S. Institutions to certify that its educational programs meet the applicable requirements for graduates to be professionally or occupationally certified in the state in which the institution is located. Failure to provide such certification may result in such programs being ineligible for Title IV program funds. It is possible that several programs offered by our schools may be adversely affected by this requirement due to lack of specialized program accreditation or certification in the states in which such institutions are based. 
   Accreditation 
         Accreditation is a private, non-governmental process for evaluating the quality of educational institutions and their programs in areas, including student performance, governance, integrity, educational quality, faculty, physical resources, administrative capability and resources and financial stability. To be recognized by the DOE, accrediting agencies must comply with DOE regulations, which require, among other things, that accrediting agencies adopt specific standards for their review of educational institutions, conduct peer review evaluations of institutions and publicly designate those institutions that meet their criteria. An accredited institution is subject to periodic review or review when necessary by its accrediting agencies to determine whether it continues to meet the performance, integrity and quality required for accreditation. Kendall College and Walden University are institutionally accredited by the Higher Learning Commission, a regional accrediting agency recognized by the DOE. NewSchool of Architecture and Design and St. Augustine are institutionally accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Senior Colleges and Universities of the Western Association of Colleges and Schools ("WASC"). Accreditation by these accrediting agencies is important to us for several reasons, one being that it enables eligible students at our U.S. Institutions to receive Title IV financial aid. In addition, other colleges and universities depend, in part, on an institution's accreditation in evaluating transfers of credit and applications to graduate schools. Employers also rely on the accredited status of institutions when evaluating candidates' credentials, and students and corporate and government sponsors under tuition reimbursement programs consider accreditation as assurance that an institution maintains quality educational standards. If any of our U.S. Institutions fails to satisfy the standards of its respective accrediting agency, that institution could lose its accreditation by that accrediting agency, which would cause it to lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. 
         The HEA and regulations issued by the DOE require accrediting agencies to monitor the growth of institutions that they accredit. Our U.S. Institutions' respective accrediting agencies require all affiliated institutions, including us, to complete an annual data report. If the non-financial data, particularly enrollment information, and any other information submitted by the institution indicate problems, rapid change or significant growth, the staff of the respective accrediting agency may require that the institution address any concerns arising from the data report in the next self-study and visit process or may recommend additional monitoring. In addition, DOE regulations require the Higher Learning Commission to notify the DOE if an institution it accredits that offers distance learning programs, such as Kendall College and Walden University, experiences an increase in its headcount enrollment of 50% or more in any fiscal year. The DOE may consider that information in connection with its own regulatory oversight activities. 
         In addition to institution-wide accreditation, there are numerous specialized accrediting agencies that accredit specific programs or schools within their jurisdiction, many of which are in healthcare and professional fields. Accreditation of specific programs by one of these specialized accrediting agencies signifies that those programs have met the additional standards of those agencies. In addition to being 
 77

   accredited by regional and/or national accrediting agencies, our U.S. Institutions also have the following specialized accreditations:
 

 the American Culinary Federation Education Foundation Accrediting Commission accredits the A.A.S. in Culinary Arts and the A.A.S. in
Baking & Pastry programs in the School of Culinary Arts at Kendall College; 
 the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs accredits the M.S. in Clinical Mental Health Counseling, M.S. in
Marriage, Couple and Family Counseling and Ph.D. in Counselor Education and Supervision programs at Walden University; 
 the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education accredits the B.S. in Nursing, M.S. in Nursing and Doctor of Nursing Practice programs at Walden
University, and the M.S. in Nursing program at St. Augustine holds new applicant status; 
 the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs accredits the B.S. in Business Administration, Master of Business Administration,
Doctor of Business Administration and Ph.D. in Management programs at Walden University; 
 the National Architecture Accrediting Board accredits NewSchool of Architecture and Design's architecture programs; 
 the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education accredits the Richard W. Riley College of Education and Leadership at Walden
University; 
 the Project Management Institute Global Accreditation Center for Project Management Education Program accredits the M.S. in Project Management
program at Walden University; 
 the ABET accredits the B.S. in Information Technology online program at Walden University; 
 the Commission for Accreditation of Physical Therapy Education accredits the first professional Physical Therapy programs at
St. Augustine; 
 the Accreditation Council for Occupational Therapy Education accredits the first professional Occupational Therapy programs at
St. Augustine; 
 the International Association for Continuing Education and Training recognizes the St. Augustine as an Authorized Provider of continuing
education programs; and 
 the Council on Social Work Education accredits the master's in social work program at Walden University, and the bachelor's in social work
program at Walden University holds candidacy status. 

         If we fail to satisfy the standards of any of these specialized accrediting agencies, we could lose the specialized accreditation for the affected programs, which could result in materially reduced student enrollments in those programs. 
   Congressional Hearings and Related Actions 
         The U.S. Congress must authorize and appropriate funding for Title IV programs under the HEA and can change the laws governing Title IV programs at any time. The HEA was most recently reauthorized in August 2008 through federal fiscal year 2014, although the U.S. Congress has taken actions required to extend Title IV programs while a HEA reauthorization remains pending and the Title IV programs remain authorized and functioning. Congress continues to engage in HEA reauthorization hearings, with such hearings examining various subjects to be potentially addressed through reauthorization, including, but not limited to, college affordability, the role of consumer information in college choices by students and families, whether Title IV programs should include institutional risk-sharing, and the role of accrediting agencies in ensuring institutional quality, among 
 78

   other items. We cannot predict the timing and terms of any eventual HEA reauthorization, including any potential changes to institutional participation or student eligibility requirements or funding levels for particular Title IV programs. 
         In addition to comprehensive reauthorizations of the HEA, Congress may periodically revise the law and other statutory requirements governing Title IV programs. In addition to Title IV programs, eligible veterans and military personnel may receive educational benefits under other federal programs. Congress must determine the funding levels for Title IV programs, and programs benefiting eligible veterans and military personnel, on an annual basis through the budget and appropriations process. A reduction in federal funding levels for Title IV programs, or for programs providing educational benefits to veterans and military personnel, could reduce the ability of some students to finance their education. The loss of, or a significant reduction in, Title IV program funds or other federal education benefits available to students at our U.S. Institutions could reduce our enrollments and revenues and have a material adverse effect on our business. 
         In recent years, the House Education and Workforce Committee and the Senate Committee on Health Education Labor and Pensions (the "HELP Committee") in the U.S. Congress have increased the focus on the role of the for-profit post-secondary education industry. In the past, these and other congressional committees have held hearings focused on, among other things, the standards and procedures of accrediting agencies, student recruiting and admissions and outcomes of students, credit hours and program length, the portion of federal student financial aid going to proprietary institutions, and the receipt of veterans and military education benefits by students enrolled at proprietary institutions. This activity may result in legislation, further rulemaking affecting participation in Title IV programs, and other governmental actions. In addition, concerns generated by congressional activity may adversely affect enrollment in and revenues of for-profit educational institutions. 
         Additionally, the U.S. Congress and the Department of Defense (the "DoD") have increased their focus in recent years on DoD tuition assistance that is used for distance education and programs at proprietary institutions. On multiple occasions since 2012, the DoD has revised its standard Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU") to include additional provisions applicable to all higher educational institutions providing educational programs through the DoD tuition assistance program. Among other things, the MOU requests that participating institutions provide meaningful information to students about the financial cost and attendance at an institution so military students can make informed decisions on where to attend school, will not use unfair, deceptive, and abusive recruiting practices and will provide academic and student support services to service members and their families. The revised MOU also implements rules to strengthen existing procedures for access to DoD installations by educational institutions, a DoD Postsecondary Education Complaint System for service members, spouses, and adult family members to register student complaints and established authorization for the military departments to establish service-specific tuition assistance eligibility criteria and management controls. Our U.S. Institutions utilizing tuition assistance have signed DoD's standard MOU. The DoD has begun to increase its enforcement activity in connection with the 2012 Executive Order. 
   Regulation of Federal Student Financial Aid Programs 
         To be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, an institution must comply with specific requirements contained in the HEA and the regulations issued thereunder by the DOE. An institution must, among other things, be licensed or authorized to offer its educational programs by the state or states in which it is located and maintain institutional accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized by the DOE. The substantial amount of federal funds disbursed to schools through Title IV programs, the large number of students and institutions participating in these programs and allegations of fraud and abuse by certain for-profit educational institutions have caused Congress to require the DOE to exercise considerable regulatory oversight over for-profit educational institutions. As a result, for-profit 
 79

   educational institutions, including ours, are subject to extensive oversight and review. Because the DOE periodically revises its regulations and changes its interpretations of existing laws and regulations, we cannot predict with certainty how the Title IV program requirements will be applied in all circumstances. 
         Significant aspects of Title IV programs include the following: 
  Eligibility and certification procedures.    Each of our U.S. Institutions must apply periodically to the DOE for continued certification to participate in Title IV programs. Such recertification generally is required every six years, but may be required earlier, including when an institution undergoes a change in control. An institution may also come under the DOE's review when it expands its activities in certain ways, such as opening an additional location, adding a new educational program or modifying the academic credentials it offers. The DOE may place an institution on provisional certification status if it finds that the institution does not fully satisfy all of the eligibility and certification standards and in certain other circumstances, such as when an institution is certified for the first time or undergoes a change in control. During the period of provisional certification, the institution must comply with any additional conditions included in the institution's program participation agreement with the DOE. In addition, the DOE may more closely review an institution that is provisionally certified if it applies for recertification or approval to open a new location, add an educational program, acquire another institution or make any other significant change. If the DOE determines that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement, it may seek to revoke the institution's certification to participate in Title IV programs without advance notice or opportunity for the institution to challenge the action. Students attending provisionally certified institutions remain eligible to receive Title IV program funds. Each of our U.S. Institutions currently is provisionally certified to participate in Title IV programs. They are also subject to a letter of credit for not satisfying the DOE's standards of financial responsibility, as described below. In addition, they are subject to additional cash management requirements with respect to their disbursements of Title IV funds, as well as certain additional reporting and disclosure requirements. 
  Gainful employment.    Under the HEA, proprietary schools generally are eligible to participate in Title IV programs in respect of educational programs that lead to "gainful employment in a recognized occupation." On October 30, 2014, the DOE published final regulations to define "gainful employment," which become effective on July 1, 2015. Historically, the concept of "gainful employment" has not been defined in detail. The final regulations require each educational program offered by a proprietary institution to achieve threshold rates in two debt measure categories: an annual debt-to-annual earnings ("DTE") ratio and an annual debt-to-discretionary income ("DTI") ratio. 
         The ratios are calculated under complex methodologies and definitions outlined in the final regulations and, in some cases, are based on data that may not be readily accessible to us. The DTE ratio is calculated by comparing (i) the annual loan payment required on the median student loan debt incurred by students receiving Title IV program funds who completed a particular program and (ii) the higher of the mean or median of those students' annual earnings approximately two to four years after they graduate. The DTI ratio is calculated by comparing (x) the annual loan payment required on the median student loan debt incurred by students receiving Title IV program funds who completed a particular program and (y) the higher of the mean or median of those students' discretionary income approximately two to four years after they graduate. 
         An educational program must achieve a DTE ratio at or below 8% or a DTI ratio at or below 20% to be considered "passing." An educational program with a DTE ratio greater than 8% but less than or equal to 12% or a DTI ratio greater than 20% but less than or equal to 30% is considered to be "in the zone." An educational program with a DTE ratio greater than 12% and a DTI ratio greater than 30% is considered "failing." An educational program will cease to be eligible for students to receive Title IV program funds if its DTE and DTI ratios are failing in two out of any three consecutive award years or if both of those rates are failing or in the zone for four consecutive award years. 
 80

          
        The final regulations also require an institution to provide warnings to current and prospective students in programs which may lose Title IV eligibility at the end of an award or fiscal year. If an educational program could become ineligible based on its ratios for the next award year, the institution must (1) deliver a warning to current and prospective students in the program and (2) not enroll, register or enter into a financial commitment with a prospective student until three business days after the warning is provided or a subsequent warning is provided, if more than thirty days have passed since the first warning. If a program becomes ineligible for students to receive Title IV program funds, the institution cannot seek to reestablish eligibility of that program, or establish the eligibility of a similar program having the same classification of instructional program ("CIP") code with the same first four digits of the CIP code of the ineligible program for three years. 
         Additionally, the final regulations require an institution to certify to the DOE that its educational programs subject to the gainful employment requirements, which include all programs offered by our U.S. Institutions, meet the applicable requirements for graduates to be professionally or occupationally licensed or certified in the state in which the institution is located. If we are unable to certify that our programs meet the applicable state requirements for graduates to be professionally or occupationally certified in that state, then we may need to cease offering certain programs in certain states or to students who are residents in certain states. 
         In January 2017, the DOE issued to institutions final DTE rates. Among the Classification of Instructional Programs reported within NewSchool of Architecture and Design, Kendall College and Walden University, the DOE has indicated that we had one that failed and five in the zone. This represents a total of one educational program that failed and 10 in the zone. St. Augustine had no programs that failed or were in the zone. The percentage of students enrolled in the educational program that failed represents approximately 1% of the students currently enrolled in our U.S. Institutions. The percentage of students enrolled in the educational programs that were in the zone represents approximately 5.3%. We are currently examining and implementing options for each of these programs and their students. The failure of any program or programs offered by any of our U.S. Institutions to satisfy any gainful employment regulations could render that program or programs ineligible for Title IV program funds. If a particular educational program ceased to become eligible for Title IV program funds, either because it fails to prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation or due to other factors, we may choose to cease offering that program. It is possible that several programs offered by our schools may be adversely affected by the regulations due to lack of specialized program accreditation or certification in the states in which such institutions are based. We also could be required to make changes to certain programs at our U.S. Institutions or to increase student loan repayment efforts in order to comply with the rule or to avoid the uncertainty associated with such compliance. 
  Administrative capability.    DOE regulations specify extensive criteria by which an institution must establish that it has the requisite "administrative capability" to participate in Title IV programs. To meet the administrative capability standards, an institution must, among other things: comply with all applicable Title IV program requirements; have an adequate number of qualified personnel to administer Title IV programs; have acceptable standards for measuring the satisfactory academic progress of its students; not have student loan cohort default rates above specified levels; have various procedures in place for awarding, disbursing and safeguarding Title IV program funds and for maintaining required records; administer Title IV programs with adequate checks and balances in its system of internal controls; not be, and not have any principal or affiliate who is, debarred or suspended from federal contracting or engaging in activity that is cause for debarment or suspension; provide financial aid counseling to its students; refer to the DOE's Office of Inspector General any credible information indicating that any student, parent, employee, third-party servicer or other agent of the institution has engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving Title IV programs; submit all required reports and financial statements in a timely manner; and not otherwise appear to lack 
 81

   administrative capability. If an institution fails to satisfy any of these criteria, the DOE may require the institution to repay Title IV funds its students previously received, change the institution's method of receiving Title IV program funds, which in some cases may result in a significant delay in the institution's receipt of those funds, place the institution on provisional certification status or commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate the institution's participation in Title IV programs. If the DOE determines that any of our U.S. Institutions failed to satisfy its administrative capability requirements, then the institution's students could lose, or be limited in their access to, Title IV program funding. 
  Financial responsibility.    The HEA and DOE regulations establish extensive standards of financial responsibility that institutions such as ours must satisfy to participate in Title IV programs. The DOE evaluates institutions for compliance with these standards on an annual basis based on the institution's annual audited financial statements as well as when the institution applies to the DOE to have its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs recertified. The most significant financial responsibility standard is the institution's composite score, which is derived from a formula established by the DOE based on three financial ratios: (1) equity ratio, which measures the institution's capital resources, financial viability and ability to borrow; (2) primary reserve ratio, which measures the institution's ability to support current operations from expendable resources; and (3) net income ratio, which measures the institution's ability to operate at a profit or within its means. The DOE assigns a strength factor to the results of each of these ratios on a scale from negative 1.0 to positive 3.0, with negative 1.0 reflecting financial weakness and positive 3.0 reflecting financial strength. The DOE then assigns a weighting percentage to each ratio and adds the weighted scores for the three ratios together to produce a composite score for the institution. The composite score must be at least 1.5 for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without the need for further DOE oversight. In addition to having an acceptable composite score, an institution must, among other things, provide the administrative resources necessary to comply with Title IV program requirements, meet all of its financial obligations including required refunds to students and any Title IV liabilities and debts, be current in its debt payments and not receive an adverse, qualified or disclaimed opinion by its accountants in its audited financial statements. 
         If the DOE determines that an institution does not meet the financial responsibility standards due to a failure to meet the composite score or other factors, the institution is able to establish financial responsibility on an alternative basis permitted by the DOE. This alternative basis could include, in the Department's discretion, posting a letter of credit, accepting provisional certification, complying with additional DOE monitoring requirements, agreeing to receive Title IV program funds under an arrangement other than the DOE's standard advance funding arrangement, such as the reimbursement method of payment or heightened cash monitoring, or complying with or accepting other limitations on the institution's ability to increase the number of programs it offers or the number of students it enrolls. 
         The DOE measures the financial responsibility of several of our U.S. Institutions on the basis of the Laureate consolidated audited financial statements and not at the individual institution level. Based on Laureate's composite score for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, the DOE determined that it and, consequently, Walden University, NewSchool of Architecture and Design, Kendall College and St. Augustine fail to meet the standards of financial responsibility. As a result, the DOE required us to either: 1) provide a letter of credit in an amount equal to 50% of Title IV program funds received by Laureate in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (calculated by the DOE to be $351,995,250) and have our U.S. Institutions qualify as financially responsible; or 2) provide a letter of credit in an amount equal to 15% of the Title IV program funds received by Laureate in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (calculated by the DOE to be $105,598,575) and for our U.S. Institutions to remain provisionally certified for a period of up to three complete Title IV program award years. The DOE also required us to comply with additional notification and reporting requirements. We have provided 
 82

   the DOE with a letter of credit in the amount of $105,598,575 and we are complying with the additional notification and reporting requirements. 
         In December 2015, the DOE required us to provide a letter of credit in the amount of $14,967 for St. Augustine (25% of the total Title IV program refunds the institution made or should have made during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014). This requirement was due to the fact that St. Augustine was found to have untimely processed returns of Title IV program funds for withdrawn students for more than 5% of the students in its auditor's sample for the 2014 fiscal year. We have obtained this letter of credit. Any requirement to provide , maintain or increase a letter of credit or other sanctions that may be imposed by the DOE could increase our cost of regulatory compliance and could affect our cash flows. The DOE has the discretion to increase our letter of credit requirements at any time. If our U.S. Institutions are unable to meet the minimum composite score requirement or comply with the other standards of financial responsibility, and could not post a required letter of credit or comply with the alternative bases for establishing financial responsibility, then students at our U.S. Institutions could lose their access to Title IV program funding. 
         On November 1, 2016, the DOE issued a final rule to revise its general standards of financial responsibility to include various actions and events that would require institutions to provide the DOE with irrevocable letters of credit. For additional information regarding this final rule, see "DOE rulemaking activities." If we are required to repay the DOE for any successful DTR claims by students who attended our U.S. Institutions, or we are required to obtain additional letters of credit or increase our current letter of credit, it could materially affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations. We are currently assessing the impact of these final regulations on our U.S. Institutions. 
  Return of Title IV funds for students who withdraw.    When a student who has received Title IV funds withdraws from school, the institution must determine the amount of Title IV program funds the student has "earned." The institution must return any unearned Title IV program funds to the appropriate lender or the DOE in a timely manner, which is generally no later than 45 days after the date the institution determined that the student withdrew. If such payments are not timely made, the institution will be required to submit a letter of credit to the DOE equal to 25% of the Title IV funds that the institution should have returned for withdrawn students in its most recently completed fiscal year. Under DOE regulations, late returns of Title IV program funds for 5% or more of the withdrawn students in the audit sample in the institution's annual Title IV compliance audit for either of the institution's two most recent fiscal years or in a DOE program review triggers this letter of credit requirement. 
         A final program review determination issued by the DOE on March 3, 2015 found that Walden University failed to timely return Title IV program funds for more than 5% of the withdrawn students during its fiscal year ended December 31, 2012. The DOE noted that such a finding would usually require Walden to post a letter of credit to the DOE equal to 25% of the Title IV funds that the institution should have returned for withdrawn students in its most recently completed fiscal year; however, such an additional letter of credit was not required in this instance because of the letter of credit that was previously posted to the DOE based on our consolidated audited financial statements failing to meet the DOE's standards of financial responsibility. 
         The "90/10 Rule."    A requirement of the HEA commonly referred to as the "90/10 Rule" provides that an institution loses its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, if, under a complex regulatory formula that requires cash basis accounting and other adjustments to the calculation of revenue, the institution derives more than 90% of its revenues for any fiscal year from Title IV program funds. This rule applies only to for-profit post-secondary educational institutions, including our U.S. Institutions. An institution is subject to loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if it exceeds the 90% threshold for two consecutive fiscal years, and an institution whose rate exceeds 90% for any single fiscal year will be placed on provisional certification and may be subject to addition conditions or sanctions imposed by the DOE. 
 83

           Using the DOE's formula under the "90/10 Rule," Kendall College derived approximately 34%, 36% and 35% of its revenues (calculated on a cash basis) from Title IV program funds in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. NewSchool of Architecture and Design derived approximately 37%, 43% and 47% of its revenues (calculated on a cash basis) from Title IV program funds in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. St. Augustine derived approximately 57%, 49% and 46% of its revenues (calculated on a cash basis) from Title IV program funds in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Walden University derived approximately 73%, 73% and 74% of its revenues (calculated on a cash basis) from Title IV program funds in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
         The ability of our U.S. Institutions to maintain 90/10 rates below 90% will depend on our enrollments, any increases in students Title IV funding eligibility in the future, and other factors outside of our control, including any reduction in government assistance for military personnel, including veterans, or changes in the treatment of such funding for the purposes of the 90/10 calculation. In recent years, several members of Congress have introduced proposals and legislation that would modify the 90/10 Rule. One such proposal would revise the 90/10 Rule to an 85/15 rule and would count DoD tuition assistance and GI Bill education benefits toward that limit. We cannot predict whether, or the extent to which, these actions could result in legislation or further rulemaking affecting the 90/10 Rule. To the extent that any such laws or regulations are enacted, our U.S. Institutions' financial condition could be adversely affected. 
  Student loan defaults.    Under the HEA, an educational institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all Title IV programs if defaults by its students on the repayment of federal student loans received under Title IV programs exceed certain levels. For each federal fiscal year, the DOE calculates a rate of student defaults on such loans for each institution, known as a "cohort default rate." Under current regulations, an institution will lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if its three-year cohort default rate equals or exceeds 30% for three consecutive cohort years or 40% for any given year. 
         The Department of Education generally publishes official cohort default rates annually in September for the repayment period that ended the prior September 30. Kendall College's official cohort default rates for the 2013, 2012 and 2011 federal fiscal years were 10.0%, 7.9% and 11.3%, respectively. NewSchool of Architecture and Design's official cohort default rates for the 2013, 2012 and 2011 federal fiscal years were 5.1%, 10.2% and 11.2%, respectively. St. Augustine's official cohort default rates for the 2013, 2012 and 2011 federal fiscal years were 0.2%, 0.5%, and 0.0%, respectively. Walden University's official cohort default rates for the 2013, 2012 and 2011 federal fiscal years were 6.7%, 6.8% and 7.8%, respectively. The average national student loan default rates published by the DOE for all institutions that participated in the federal student aid programs for 2013, 2012 and 2011 were 11.3%, 11.8% and 13.7%, respectively, and for all proprietary institutions that participated in the federal student aid programs for 2013, 2012 and 2011 were 15.0%, 15.8% and 19.1%, respectively. 
         Incentive compensation rule.    Under the HEA, an educational institution that participates in Title IV programs may not make any commission, bonus or other incentive payments to any persons or entities involved in recruitment or admissions activities or in the awarding of financial aid pertaining to U.S. citizens, permanent residents and others temporarily residing in the United States with the intention of becoming a citizen or permanent resident. The DOE has taken the position that any commission, bonus or other incentive compensation based in any part, directly or indirectly, or securing enrollment or awarding financial aid is inconsistent with the statutory prohibition against incentive compensation. The DOE has maintained that institutions may make merit-based adjustments to employee compensation, provided that those adjustments are not based, in any part, directly or indirectly, upon securing enrollments or awarding financial aid. In sub-regulatory correspondence to institutions regarding its regulatory changes, the DOE provided additional guidance regarding the scope of the prohibition on incentive compensation and to what employees and types of activities the prohibition applies. 
 84

           In addition, in recent years, other post-secondary educational institutions have been named as defendants to whistleblower lawsuits, known as "qui tam" cases, brought by current or former employees pursuant to the Federal False Claims Act, alleging that their institutions' compensation practices did not comply with the incentive compensation rule. A qui tam case is a civil lawsuit brought by one or more individuals (a "relator") on behalf of the federal government for an alleged submission to the government of a false claim for payment. The relator, often a current or former employee, is entitled to a share of the government's recovery in the case, including the possibility of treble damages. A  qui tam action is always filed under seal and remains under seal until the government decides whether to intervene in the case. If the government intervenes, it takes over primary control of the litigation. If the government declines to intervene in the case, the relator may nonetheless elect to continue to pursue the litigation at his or her own expense on behalf of the government. Any such litigation could be costly and could divert management's time and attention away from the business, regardless of whether a claim has merit. 
  Substantial misrepresentation.    An institution participating in Title IV programs is prohibited from making misrepresentations regarding the nature of its educational programs, the nature of financial charges and availability of financial assistance, or the employability of graduates. A misrepresentation is defined in the regulations as any false, erroneous or misleading statement to any student or prospective student, any member of the public, an accrediting agency, a state agency or the DOE, and, significantly, the regulations as promulgated by the DOE define misleading statements to broadly include any statements that have a likelihood or tendency to deceive. If any of our U.S. Institutionsor any entity, organization, or person with whom the institution has an agreement to provide educational programs or to provide marketing, advertising, recruiting, or admissions servicescommitted a misrepresentation for which a person could reasonably be expected to rely, or has reasonably relied, to that person's detriment, the DOE could initiate proceedings to revoke the institution's Title IV eligibility, deny applications made by the institution, impose fines, or initiate a limitation, suspension or termination proceeding against the institution. 
         Compliance reviews.    Our U.S. Institutions are subject to announced and unannounced compliance reviews and audits by various external agencies, including the DOE, its Office of Inspector General, state licensing agencies, various state approving agencies for financial assistance to veterans and accrediting agencies. In general, after the DOE conducts a site visit and reviews data supplied by an institution, the DOE sends the institution a program review report and affords the institution with an opportunity to respond to any findings. The DOE then issues a final program review determination letter, which identifies any liabilities. 
         On March 3, 2015, the DOE issued a final program review determination letter to Walden University for a September 2012 review of the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 Title IV award years. The letter required Walden University to return $34,281 in Title IV funds, and also found that Walden University failed to timely return Title IV program funds for more than 5% of the withdrawn students during its fiscal year ended December 31, 2012. The DOE noted that such a finding would usually require Walden to post a letter of credit to the DOE equal to 25% of the Title IV funds that the institution should have returned for withdrawn students in its most recently completed fiscal year; however, such an additional letter of credit was not required in this instance because of the letter of credit that was previously posted to the DOE based on our consolidated audited financial statements failing to meet the DOE's standards of financial responsibility. On September 11, 2015, the DOE issued an expedited final program review determination letter to Kendall College regarding a March-April 2015 program review. The letter determined that Kendall College has taken corrective actions necessary to resolve all findings. In addition, on September 21, 2015, the Higher Learning Commission notified Kendall College that the Higher Learning Commission placed the school on ongoing financial monitoring over the next 24 months. Such action was primarily due to concerns over the school's continued reliance upon Laureate to provide financial support to sustain its operations. In May 2017, 
 85

   Kendall College and Walden University are scheduled to host interim site visits from their institutional accreditor, Higher Learning Commission, as a condition of their ongoing accreditation. On September 8, 2016, MOHE sent to Walden University an information request regarding its doctoral programs and complaints filed by doctoral students, as part of a program review that MOHE is conducting. We have been informed by MOHE that in an effort to better understand the context, background and issues related to doctoral student complaints in Minnesota, MOHE is initiating a full review of doctoral programs for institutions registered in Minnesota. 
         As part of the DOE's ongoing monitoring of institutions' administration of Title IV programs, the HEA also requires institutions to annually submit to the DOE a Title IV compliance audit conducted by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with applicable federal and DOE audit standards. In addition, to enable the DOE to make a determination of an institution's financial responsibility, each institution must annually submit audited financial statements prepared in accordance with DOE regulations. 
         DOE rulemaking activities.    On October 30, 2015, the DOE published final regulations on cash management and debit card practices, retaking coursework, and clock-to-credit hour conversion. A majority of the provisions of the regulations took effect on July 1, 2016, and others took effect on later dates in 2016. The final regulations concerning cash management require, among other things, that institutions subject to heightened cash monitoring procedures for disbursements of Title IV funds must, effective July 1, 2016, pay to students any applicable Title IV credit balances before requesting such funds from the DOE. St. Augustine, Walden University, NewSchool of Architecture and Design and Kendall College are currently subject to heightened cash monitoring procedures. We have reviewed the regulations and made appropriate adjustments in our business operations to meet those requirements effective July 1, 2016. 
         On October 31, 2016, the DOE published final regulations teacher preparation program accountability systems under the HEA, and additionally proposed amendments on teacher preparation program eligibility for TEACH Grant participation. On March 8, 2017, the U.S. Congress enacted a joint resolution disapproving these October 31, 2016 final regulations on teacher preparation pursuant to the Congressional Review Act. On March 27, 2017, the President signed the joint resolution nullifying these final regulations on teacher preparation and prohibiting the DOE from reissuing regulations in substantially the same form, or from issuing new regulations that are substantially the same, unless such reissued or new regulations are specifically authorized by the U.S. Congress subsequent to its joint resolution disapproving the October 31, 2016 final regulations. 
         On December 19, 2016, the DOE published final regulations regarding state authorization for programs offered through distance education and state authorization for foreign locations of institutions. Among other provisions, these final regulations require that an institution participating in the Title IV federal student aid programs and offering postsecondary education through distance education be authorized by each state in which the institution enrolls students, if such authorization is required by the state. The DOE would recognize authorization through participation in a state authorization reciprocity agreement, if the agreement does not prevent a state from enforcing its own laws. The final regulations also require that foreign additional locations and branch campuses be authorized by the appropriate foreign government agency and, if at least 50% of a program can be completed at the location/branch, be approved by the institution's accrediting agency and be reported to the state where the main campus is located. The final regulations would also require institutions to: document the state process for resolving complaints from students enrolled in programs offered through distance education or correspondence courses; and make certain public and individualized disclosures to enrolled and prospective students about their distance education programs. These final regulations are effective July 1, 2018. 
 86

           On November 1, 2016, the DOE published a final rule that, among other provisions, establishes new standards and processes for determining whether a Direct Loan Program borrower has a defense to repayment ("DTR") on a loan due to acts or omissions by the institution at which the loan was used by the borrower for educational expenses. The final regulations take effect on July 1, 2017. Among other topics, this final rule establishes permissible borrower defense claims for discharge, procedural rules under which claims will be adjudicated, time limits for borrowers' claims, and guidelines for recoupment by the DOE of discharged loan amounts from institutions of higher education. It also prohibits schools from using any pre-dispute arbitration agreements, prohibits schools from prohibiting relief in the form of class actions by student borrowers, and invalidates clauses imposing requirements that students pursue an internal dispute resolution process before contacting authorities regarding concerns about an institution. For proprietary institutions, the final rule describes the threshold for loan repayment rates that will require specific disclosures to current and prospective students and the applicable loan repayment rate methodology. The final rule also establishes important new financial responsibility and administrative capacity requirements for both not-for-profit and for-profit institutions participating in the Title IV programs. For example, certain events would automatically trigger the need for a school to obtain a letter of credit including, for publicly traded institutions, if the SEC warns the school that it may suspend trading on the school's stock, the school failed to timely file a required annual or quarterly report with the SEC, or the exchange on which the stock is traded notifies the school that it is not in compliance with exchange requirements or the stock is delisted. Other events would require a recalculation of a school's composite score of financial responsibility, including, for a proprietary institution whose score is less than 1.5, any withdrawal of an owner's equity by any means, including by declaring a dividend, unless the equity is transferred within the affiliated entity group on whose basis the composite score was calculated. The final rule also sets forth events that are discretionary triggers for letters of credit, meaning that if any of them occur, the DOE may choose to require a letter of credit, increase an existing letter of credit requirement or demand some other form of surety from the institution. The final rule provides that if an institution fails to meet the composite score requirement for longer than three years under provisional certification, the DOE may mandate additional financial protection from the institution or any party with "substantial control" over the institution. Such parties with "substantial control" must agree to jointly and severally guarantee the Title IV liabilities of the institution at the end of the three-year provisional certification period. Under current regulations, a party may be deemed to have "substantial control" over an institution if, among other factors, the party directly or indirectly holds an ownership interest of 25% or more of an institution, or is a member of the board of directors, a general partner, the chief executive officer or other executive officer of the institution. If we are required to repay the DOE for any successful DTR claims by students who attended our U.S. Institutions, or we are required to obtain additional letters of credit or increase our current letter of credit, it could materially affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations. We are in the process of evaluating the final regulations and cannot predict with certainty what impact the final regulations will have on our business and the educational programs offered by our U.S. Institutions. 
         Privacy of student records.    The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 ("FERPA"), and the DOE's FERPA regulations require educational institutions to protect the privacy of students' educational records by limiting an institution's disclosure of a student's personally identifiable information without the student's prior written consent. FERPA also requires institutions to allow students to review and request changes to their educational records maintained by the institution, to notify students at least annually of this inspection right and to maintain records in each student's file listing requests for access to and disclosures of personally identifiable information and the interest of such party in that information. If an institution fails to comply with FERPA, the DOE may require corrective actions by the institution or may terminate an institution's receipt of further federal funds. In addition, our U.S. Institutions are obligated to safeguard student information pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the "GLBA"), a federal law designed to protect consumers' personal financial 
 87

   information held by financial institutions and other entities that provide financial services to consumers. The GLBA and the applicable GLBA regulations require an institution to, among other things, develop and maintain a comprehensive, written information security program designed to protect against the unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable financial information of students, parents or other individuals with whom such institution has a customer relationship. If an institution fails to comply with the applicable GLBA requirements, it may be required to take corrective actions, be subject to monitoring and oversight by the FTC, and be subject to fines or penalties imposed by the FTC. For-profit educational institutions are also subject to the general deceptive practices jurisdiction of the FTC with respect to their collection, use and disclosure of student information. The institution must also comply with the FTC Red Flags Rule, a section of the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, that requires the establishment of guidelines and policies regarding identity theft related to student credit accounts. 
         Potential effect of regulatory violations.    If any of our U.S. Institutions fails to comply with the regulatory standards governing Title IV programs, the DOE could impose one or more sanctions, including requiring us to repay Title IV program funds, requiring us to post a letter of credit in favor of the DOE as a condition for continued Title IV certification, taking emergency action against us, initiating proceedings to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate our participation in Title IV programs or referring the matter for civil or criminal prosecution. Because our U.S. Institutions are provisionally certified to participate in Title IV programs, the DOE may revoke the certification of these institutions without advance notice or advance opportunity for us to challenge that action. If such sanctions or proceedings were imposed against us and resulted in a substantial curtailment or termination of our participation in Title IV programs, our enrollments, revenues and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
         In addition to the actions that may be brought against us as a result of our participation in Title IV programs, we are also subject to complaints and lawsuits relating to regulatory compliance brought not only by regulatory agencies, but also by other government agencies and third parties, such as current or former students or employees and other members of the public. 
   Regulatory Standards that May Restrict Institutional Expansion or Other Changes in the United States 
         Many actions that we may wish to take in connection with expanding our operations or other changes in the United States are subject to review or approval by the applicable regulatory agencies. 
  Adding teaching locations, implementing new educational programs and increasing enrollment.    The requirements and standards of state education agencies, accrediting agencies and the DOE limit our ability in certain instances to establish additional teaching locations, implement new educational programs or increase enrollment in certain programs. Many states require review and approval before institutions can add new locations or programs. Our U.S. Institutions' state educational agencies and institutional and specialized accrediting agencies that authorize or accredit our U.S. Institutions and their programs generally require institutions to notify them in advance of adding new locations or implementing new programs, and upon notification may undertake a review of the quality of the facility or the program and the financial, academic and other qualifications of the institution. 
         With respect to the DOE, if an institution participating in Title IV programs plans to add a new location or educational program, the institution must generally apply to the DOE to have the additional location or educational program designated as within the scope of the institution's Title IV eligibility. As a condition for an institution to participate in Title IV programs on a provisional basis, as in our case, the DOE can require prior approval of such programs or otherwise restrict the number of programs an institution may add or the extent to which an institution can modify existing educational programs. If an institution that is required to obtain the DOE's advance approval for the addition of a 
 88

   new program or new location fails to do so, the institution may be liable for repayment of the Title IV program funds received by the institution or students in connection with that program or enrolled at that location. 
  Provisional certification.    Each institution must apply to the DOE for continued certification to participate in Title IV programs at least every six years and when it undergoes a change in control. An institution may also come under the DOE's review when it expands its activities in certain ways, such as opening an additional location, adding an educational program or modifying the academic credentials that it offers. 
         The DOE may place an institution on provisional certification status if it finds that the institution does not fully satisfy all of the eligibility and certification standards. In addition, if a company acquires an institution from another entity, the acquired institution will automatically be placed on provisional certification when the DOE approves the transaction. During the period of provisional certification, the institution must comply with any additional conditions or restrictions included in its program participation agreement with the DOE. Students attending provisionally certified institutions remain eligible to receive Title IV program funds, but if the DOE finds that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement, it may seek to revoke the institution's certification to participate in Title IV programs without advance notice or advance opportunity for the institution to challenge that action. In addition, the DOE may more closely review an institution that is provisionally certified if it applies for recertification or approval to open a new location, add an educational program, acquire another institution or make any other significant change. All of our U.S. Institutions currently participate in Title IV programs pursuant to provisional participation agreements due to our conversion to a public benefit corporation and our initial public offering, as well as because we do not meet the DOE's standards of financial responsibility. 
         Acquiring other institutions.    We have acquired other institutions in the past, and we may seek to do so in the future. The DOE and virtually all state education agencies and accrediting agencies require a company to obtain their approval if it wishes to acquire another institution. The level of review varies by individual state and accrediting agency, with some requiring approval of such an acquisition before it occurs while others only consider approval after the acquisition has occurred. The approval of the applicable state education agencies and accrediting agencies is a necessary prerequisite to the DOE certifying the acquired institution to participate in Title IV programs. The restrictions imposed by any of the applicable regulatory agencies could delay or prevent our acquisition of other institutions in some circumstances or could delay the ability of an acquired institution to participate in Title IV programs. 
  Change in ownership resulting in a change in control.    The DOE and many states and accrediting agencies require institutions of higher education to report or obtain approval of certain changes in control and changes in other aspects of institutional organization or control. Under DOE's regulations, an institution that undergoes a change in control loses its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and must apply to the DOE to reestablish such eligibility. If an institution files the required application and follows other procedures, the DOE may temporarily certify the institution on a provisional basis following the change in control, so that the institution's students retain continued access to Title IV program funds. In addition, the DOE may extend such temporary provisional certification if the institution timely files certain required materials, including the approval of the change in control by its state authorizing agency and accrediting agency and certain financial information pertaining to the financial condition of the institution or its parent corporation. 
         The DOE previously notified us that it considers our recent initial public offering and our recent conversion to a Delaware public benefit corporation to be changes of ownership resulting in changes in control under the DOE's regulations. Also, the DOE will only formally review and approve change of ownerships resulting in changes in control after such changes have occurred. Accordingly, we applied to 
 89

   the DOE on behalf of Kendall College, NewSchool of Architecture and Design, St. Augustine and Walden University for approval of these institutions' continued participation in Title IV programs in connection with the recent conversion to a Delaware public benefit corporation. The DOE completed its review of the conversion and issued provisional program participation agreements to the institutions with respect to the conversion. We have similarly applied to the DOE on behalf of Kendall College, NewSchool of Architecture and Design, St. Augustine and Walden University for approval of these institutions' continued participation in Title IV programs in connection with our recent initial public offering. The DOE's review of the initial public offering remains pending. The DOE has issued temporary program participation agreements to the institutions, which will expire on March 31, 2017. If certain documents are submitted to DOE before the expiration of the temporary program participation agreements, the eligibility of the institutions to participate in the Title IV programs will be continued on a month-to-month basis while the DOE completes its review of the initial public offering. There can be no assurance that the DOE will formally approve our initial public offering and recertify our U.S. Institutions for continued Title IV program eligibility. If the DOE fails to recertify the institutions and to issue provisional program participation agreements to the institutions with respect to the initial public offering, students at the affected institutions would no longer be able to receive Title IV program funds. The DOE could also recertify our U.S. Institutions with respect to the initial public offering, but restrict or delay students' receipt of Title IV program funds, limit the number of students to whom an institution could disburse such funds, or impose other restrictions. 
         The types of and thresholds for such reporting and approval vary among the states and accrediting agencies. Certain accrediting agencies may require that an institution must obtain its approval in advance of a change in control, structure or organization for the institution to retain its accredited status. In addition, in the event of a change in control, structure or organization, certain accrediting agencies may require a post-transaction focused visit or other evaluation to review the appropriateness of its approval of the change and whether the institution has met the commitment it made to the accrediting agency prior to the approval. Other specialized accrediting agencies also require an institution to obtain similar approval before or after the event that constitutes a change in control under their standards. Many states include the transfer of a controlling interest of common stock in the definition of a change in control requiring approval. Some state educational agencies that regulate us may require us to obtain approval of the change in control to maintain authorization to operate in that state, and in some cases such states could require us to obtain advance approval of a change in control. 
         We sought confirmation from the accrediting agencies for Kendall College, NewSchool of Architecture and Design, St. Augustine and Walden University, as well as from the U.S. institutional accrediting agency for Universidad Andrés Bello, whether our initial public offering constitutes a change of control under their respective standards. We also sought guidance from applicable state educational agencies as to whether the recent initial public offering constitutes a change of control requiring approval under their respective regulations. 
         Many states and accreditors have informed us that our initial public offering did not constitute a change of control, but some agencies have determined that the offering will need to be reviewed under their respective change of ownership standards. We have notified each agency regarding the offering and some have requested additional information in connection with the offering. For instance, the Florida Commission for Independent Education has determined that the initial public offering requires its review and approval with respect to St. Augustine, and we have filed the required applications for such approval. Our failure to obtain any required approval of our initial public offering from the DOE, the institutional accrediting agencies, or the pertinent state educational agencies could result in one or more of our U.S. Institutions losing continued eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs, accreditation or state licensure, which could have a material adverse effect on our U.S. business, financial condition and results of operations. 
         In addition, we increased our ownership of St. Augustine from 80% to 100% on June 7, 2016. The 20% noncontrolling interest was previously held by Patris of St. Augustine, Inc. and subject to a put right, which Patris of St. Augustine, Inc. elected to exercise. We have notified St. Augustine's applicable regulators regarding the increase in the percentage of our ownership in St. Augustine.
