Item 1.   Business
Overview
Rite Aid Corporation (“Rite Aid” or the “Company”) is on the front lines of delivering health care services and retail products to over one million Americans daily. Our pharmacists are uniquely positioned to engage with customers and improve their health outcomes. We provide an array of whole being health products and services for the entire family through over 2,500 retail pharmacy locations across 17 states. Through Elixir, our pharmacy benefits manager, we provide pharmacy benefits and services to over three million members nationwide.
Our corporate headquarters are located at 30 Hunter Lane, Camp Hill, Pennsylvania 17011, and our telephone number is (717) 761-2633. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol of “RAD.” We were incorporated in 1968 and are a Delaware corporation.
The terms “Company,” “Rite Aid,” “we,” “our” or “us,” as used herein and unless otherwise stated or indicated by context, refer to Rite Aid Corporation and its affiliates. The term “affiliates” means direct and indirect subsidiaries of Rite Aid Corporation and partnerships and joint ventures in which such subsidiaries are partners.
Fiscal 2021 was a year of significant challenges for Rite Aid as COVID-19 affected all aspects of our retail pharmacy business and well-being of our customers. In the third week of our fiscal year, in response to the pandemic we implemented business continuity efforts including closing corporate office and call center locations, moving virtually all of our corporate associates to a work from home model, and taking steps to implement safety protocols for our retail and distribution center associates and pharmacy customers. Notwithstanding these challenges, our purchasing teams sourced essential items to stock our stores.
The efforts of our team enabled us to respond to the challenges brought on by the pandemic while also executing on our strategic initiatives aimed at operating as a fully integrated, stand-alone healthcare company with a retail footprint. Our key accomplishments include, but are not limited to, i) advancing our pharmacy strategy, including rebranding our retail stores and Elixir, our pharmacy services operations, ii) launching a new member portal at Elixir, iii) extending all but $91 million of our calendar 2023 bond maturities to calendar 2025 and calendar 2026, iv) introducing three flagship remodels, refreshing over half of our store exteriors and resetting 75% of store merchandise, and v) expanding COVID-19 testing to over 1,200 drive-through locations and beginning the process of expanding our COVID-19 vaccine administration, which covered nearly half of our stores in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. These accomplishments advanced our efforts to drive our new strategy - RxEvolution.
RxEvolution – On March 16, 2020, we held an analyst day where we announced our new strategic plan and initiatives, named “RxEvolution,” which includes significant rebranding, a merchandising overhaul, new marketing, and integration and operational initiatives, in both our Retail Pharmacy and Pharmacy Services segments. The execution of these overarching initiatives includes reintroducing the Rite Aid brand to a new generation of consumers, maintaining relevance in an ever-changing marketplace, and thriving as a significant health care services company with a retail footprint. Our initiatives are focused on three primary areas: i) establishing Elixir as a clearly differentiated market leader, ii) unlocking the value of our pharmacists, and iii) renewing our retail and digital experience.
Establishing Elixir as a clearly differentiated market leader: Rite Aid’s pharmacy benefits and services company, Elixir, includes technology and claims adjudication software, mail delivery and specialty pharmacy services, network and rebate administration, as well as prescription discount programs and Medicare Part D insurance for individuals and groups. With an integrated offering, this rebranded business is well positioned with mid-market employer groups and regional health plans seeking an alternative to the large, health plan affiliated PBMs. Additionally, given the connection with Rite Aid’s stores, Elixir has the opportunity to improve its competitive positioning, deliver exceptional retail and mail order pharmacy services, and contribute to positive health outcomes. Elixir is now the only payor agnostic PBM operated together with a retail pharmacy footprint. We believe Elixir is positioned for improved profitability, and represents a significant growth opportunity for Rite Aid.
Unlocking the value of Rite Aid’s pharmacists: Rite Aid is innovating across all of its retail and mail order pharmacy channels, including its PBM and suite of pharmacy service solutions. These innovations go beyond just filling prescriptions to offering an array of over-the-counter, clinical and holistic health and wellness solutions focused on helping customers thrive. Pharmacists are highly educated, knowledgeable, accessible, and among the most trusted

healthcare providers; however, their full potential has not been realized. Rite Aid’s approximately 6,400 pharmacists are whole-being health advocates, allowing them to practice at the top of their license and education. Our pharmacists are pushing beyond their traditional role to an expanded role, in which they are encouraging a holistic approach to health. Rite Aid is leveraging LEAN tools, to develop new workflows and technologies to free up our pharmacists’ time, and we are also launching our new Pharmacy of the Future, which moves our pharmacists physically closer to the consumer. These new workflows, tools and space will allow our pharmacists to engage more personally with our consumers. Our initiatives to free up pharmacists time are also helping us to expand our pharmacy services to administer COVID-19 vaccines and COVID-19 testing.
Renewing Rite Aid’s retail and digital experience: As consumers increasingly focus on self-care, they seek to strike the perfect balance between traditional health and holistic wellness. Rite Aid’s goal is to be a whole being health destination that treats mind, body and spirit. To introduce new generations to our iconic brand, Rite Aid is elevating its in-store experience, increasing personalized digital engagement, and refreshing merchandise to include a wide assortment of products with ingredients that are meaningful to Millennial and Gen X shoppers. Rite Aid has re-branded with a new logo to signal this change in pharmacy and retail strategy. Rite Aid continues its store-remodel initiative, including the unveiling of new flagship stores in select markets that demonstrate how Rite Aid is evolving into a trusted household wellness destination that helps consumers on the journey of care for themselves and their parents, children and pets.
We believe that the strategy inherent in our RxEvolution will enable us to unlock the incredible potential of our trusted and iconic brand. By reinvigorating our PBM offerings, enhancing the role of our approximately 6,400 pharmacists and revitalizing our retail and digital experience, we believe Rite Aid will not only remain relevant to a new generation of consumers, but can thrive as an independent healthcare company with a significant retail footprint.
As described in the following paragraphs, under prior leadership, during the past several years, Rite Aid had been involved in certain activities designed to sell itself and portions of its business.
Termination of the Merger Agreement—On February 18, 2018, Rite Aid entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Albertsons Companies, Inc. (“Albertsons”), Ranch Acquisition II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Albertsons (“Merger Sub II”) and Ranch Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Merger Sub II (together with Merger Sub II, the “Merger Subs”). On August 8, 2018, Rite Aid, Albertsons and the Merger Subs entered into a Termination Agreement (the “Merger Termination Agreement”) under which the parties mutually agreed to terminate the Merger Agreement. Subject to limited customary exceptions, the Merger Termination Agreement mutually releases the parties from any claims of liability to one another relating to the contemplated merger. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, neither Rite Aid nor Albertsons is responsible for any payments to the other party as a result of the termination of the Merger Agreement and Rite Aid is no longer subject to the interim operating covenants and restrictions contained in the Merger Agreement.
Asset Sale—On September 18, 2017, we entered into the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement”) with WBA and Walgreen Co., an Illinois corporation and wholly-owned direct subsidiary of WBA (“Buyer”), which amended and restated in its entirety the previously disclosed Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Original Asset Purchase Agreement”), dated as of June 28, 2017, by and among Rite Aid, WBA and Buyer. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement, Buyer purchased from Rite Aid 1,932 Acquired Stores, three distribution centers, related inventory and other specified assets and liabilities related thereto for a purchase price of approximately $4.375 billion, on a cash-free, debt-free basis (the “Asset Sale” or “Sale”). As of February 27, 2021, we sold all 1,932 Acquired Stores, three distribution centers and related assets to WBA in exchange for proceeds of $4.375 billion.
The term of the Transition Services Agreement (“TSA”) had been extended to October 17, 2020, unless earlier terminated. On July 14, 2020, we entered into a letter agreement with WBA to terminate the services under the TSA, other than certain specified services relating to real estate, accounting, tax, and accounts receivable systems that continued until October 17, 2020 and certain specified services relating to human resources to be performed after October 17, 2020.
Based on its magnitude and because we exited certain markets, the Sale represented a significant strategic shift that had a material effect on our operations and financial results. Accordingly, we have applied discontinued operations treatment for the Sale, as required by generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).

We report our business in two distinct segments. Our Retail Pharmacy Segment consists of Rite Aid stores, Health Dialog, and RediClinic, which was closed during fiscal 2021. Our Pharmacy Services Segment consists of Elixir, our PBM.
Retail Pharmacy Segment— In our Rite Aid retail stores, our highly trained pharmacists dispense medications pursuant to prescriptions written by medical providers and educate our customers on alternative remedies that can supplement traditional options. We offer a wide range of healthcare services, including administering immunizations against COVID-19, the flu, shingles and more; assisting our customers with high blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes; providing guidance on combating obesity and tobacco addiction; and educating our customers on managing medications and potential side effects. Through the pandemic, pharmacists are on the front lines of testing and vaccinating, and made great strides in changing perceptions of pharmacists as providers whose reach extends well beyond filling prescriptions. We believe that offerings such as these will gain additional momentum in a rapidly changing healthcare environment, and establish pharmacists as the most accessible and trusted last-mile connectors in healthcare.
In addition, we offer a wide assortment of front-end merchandise to complement our pharmacy services and to provide convenience to our customers. In fiscal 2021, prescription drug sales accounted for 66.7% of our total drugstore sales. We believe that our pharmacy operations will continue to represent a significant part of our business due to a combination of our efforts to expand the role of our approximately 6,400 pharmacists as whole-being health advocates; demographic trends such as an aging population and increased life expectancy; our focus on growth customers, particularly women between the ages of 25 to 49 who take care of themselves, their children, aging parents, and even pets; anticipated growth in the federally funded Medicare Part D prescription program as “baby boomers” continue to enroll; and the discovery of new and better prescription drug and over-the-counter therapies. We carry a full assortment of front-end products, which accounted for the remaining 33.3% of our total drug store sales in fiscal 2021. Front-end products include over-the-counter medications, health and beauty aids, personal care items, cosmetics, household items, food and beverages, greeting cards, seasonal merchandise, pet care, and numerous other every day and convenience products.
We seek to differentiate our stores from larger chain drugstores, in part, through our emphasis on the benefits of both traditional and alternative remedies, a reconstituted assortment of clean, natural, organic and eco-friendly merchandise, brand new flagship store format, owned brands and our strategic partnership with GNC, a retailer of vitamin and mineral supplements. We offer a wide variety of products through our portfolio of owned brands, which contributed approximately 19% of our front-end sales in fiscal 2021, and which we are positioning for future growth.
We completed the acquisition of the Bartell Drug Company during December 2020. The strategic acquisition of the Bartell Drug Company fits into our RxEvolution strategy, complementing our commitment to total health and wellness, the importance of the pharmacist as a trusted health advisor and the critical role the neighborhood pharmacy plays. This expansion within the greater Seattle area will allow us to better service customers, health plans and healthcare provides.
The average size of each store in our chain is approximately 13,600 square feet, and average store size is larger for our locations in the western United States. As of February 27, 2021, 59% of our stores were freestanding; 54% of our stores included a drive-through pharmacy; and 66% included a GNC store within a Rite Aid store.
Health Dialog is a provider of healthcare coaching and disease management services to health plans and employers. Health Dialog provides these services using a call-in line staffed by nurse practitioners and through an online platform.
RediClinic, based in Houston, was an operator of retail clinics. RediClinics were staffed by board-certified nurse practitioners and physician assistants, who were trained and licensed to treat common conditions and provide preventative services, in collaboration with local physicians who were affiliated with a leading health care system in each market. We closed all RediClinic locations as of late summer 2020, however, we continue to offer virtual health care services through telehealth.
Pharmacy Services Segment—Elixir, our mid-market national pharmacy benefits manager (“PBM”), provides a suite of PBM offerings including technology solutions, mail delivery services, specialty pharmacy, network and rebate

administration, claims adjudication and pharmacy discount programs. Elixir also provides prescription discount programs and Medicare Part D insurance offerings for individuals and groups. Elixir provides services to various clients across its different lines of business, including major health plans, commercial employers, labor groups and state and local governments, representing approximately 3.25 million covered lives, including approximately 1 million covered lives through our Medicare Part D insurance offerings. Elixir continues to focus its efforts and offerings to its target market of small to mid-market employers, labor unions and regional health plans, including provider-led health plans and government sponsored Medicaid and Medicare plans.
Elixir is an integral component of our new strategy and we believe that Elixir will be established as a differentiated market leader by lowering total healthcare costs through consumer engagement. We are broadening the engagement channels for our members through the introduction of a new member portal in January 2021, modernizing our technology platforms, enhancing our clinical programs and launching our new best in class specialty offering across our book of business. And in markets that overlap with Rite Aid and Bartell stores, we can offer a highly curated clinical offering that not only lowers costs, but also engages members in our stores with our pharmacists. Rite Aid has owned 100% of Elixir (formerly EnvisionRxOptions) since 2015.
Industry Trends
COVID-19—The COVID-19 crisis brought many new challenges to the industry, and severely impacted the U.S. economy. We executed preparedness plans to maintain continuity of our operations, including transitioning many office-based associates to a remote work environment and installing protective equipment in our retail pharmacies. We also provided enhanced benefits to our associates, including bonuses to frontline associates, paid sick leave for part-time associates and paid time off to associates who test positive or are quarantined due to exposure to COVID-19, job protected administrative leave for associates who did not feel comfortable coming to work due to health concerns, and expanded resources to assist associates with the stress caused by the pandemic. Going forward, we expect to incur costs for enhanced cleaning, associate benefits and protection for both our associates and customers, and to provide COVID-19 testing and vaccinations. The longer-term impact of the pandemic including changes in consumer behavior and delayed medical procedures are still being evaluated, but we believe these will continue through our fiscal year 2022.
Aside from the effects of COVID-19, the rate of pharmacy sales growth in the United States continues to be negatively impacted by a decline in new blockbuster drugs, a longer FDA approval process, drug safety concerns, higher copays and an increase in the use of generic (non-brand name) drugs, which are less expensive but do generate higher gross margins. New drug development in the next few years is expected to be concentrated in specialty prescriptions, which are high cost drugs targeted toward complex or rare chronic conditions. On the other hand, we expect prescription usage to continue to grow in the coming years due to the aging U.S. population, increased life expectancy, “baby boomers” continuing to become eligible for the federally funded Medicare prescription program, and new drug therapies. Additionally, rising U.S. healthcare costs and the shortage of primary care physicians are creating opportunities for pharmacists and drugstores to play a more active role in driving positive health outcomes for patients. Services such as immunizations, including those for COVID-19, medication therapy management, chronic condition management, clinics, medication adherence and counseling can all be handled by our trained pharmacists. 
In terms of our traditional drug dispensing business, generic prescription drugs continue to help lower overall costs for customers and third party payors. We believe the utilization of existing generic pharmaceuticals will continue to increase, although the pace of introduction of new generic drugs has slowed. The gross profit from a generic drug prescription in the retail drugstore industry is generally greater than the gross profit from a brand drug prescription. However, the sale amount can be substantially less and has impacted our overall revenues and same store sales.
The retail drugstore industry is highly competitive and consolidation has accelerated. We believe that the competitive advantages from the increasing trend toward vertical integration resulting from the combination of retail pharmacy companies with PBMs and insurance companies, such as CVS Health, and aggressive generic pricing programs at competitors such as Wal-Mart and various supermarket chains, will further increase competitive pressures in the industry. Front-end product pricing has continued to be highly promotional in the retail drugstore business, which contributes to additional competitive pressures.

The retail drugstore industry continues to rely significantly on third-party payors. Over the past several years, third-party payors, including the Medicare Part D plans and the state-sponsored Medicaid and related managed care Medicaid agencies, have changed the eligibility requirements of participants and have successfully reduced certain reimbursement rates. This trend is expected to continue, which puts added pressure on Rite Aid and our competitors’ results. Medicare Part D providers have also introduced plans that have restricted network options, under which a patient can elect a plan with a lower copay in exchange for the choice to use a limited number of pharmacies to fill their prescriptions. In order to participate in these restricted networks, retail pharmacies generally are required to accept lower reimbursement rates. We expect the use of these restricted network strategies to continue to increase. When third party payors, including the Medicare Part D program and state-sponsored Medicaid agencies, reduce the number of participants and/or reduce their reimbursement rates, sales and margins in the industry could be reduced, and profitability of the industry adversely affected. These possible adverse effects can be partially offset by lowering our product cost, controlling expenses, dispensing higher-margin generics, finding new revenue streams through pharmacy services and growing our share of dispensing prescriptions.
The PBM industry is generally concentrated among the three largest PBMs, although niche PBMs and organizations seeking to carve out specific PBM-related services continue to emerge.  Plan sponsor clients of PBMs are seeking new and innovative solutions to manage pharmacy benefit costs.  Certain market segments, such as regional health plans, and union/municipal plans and certain mid-market employers are seeking viable alternatives to the Big 3 PBM providers.  Also, plan sponsors with covered populations in geographically concentrated areas, such as hospital/health system clients and small to mid-sized employers, are seeking to leverage geographic opportunities to negotiate more favorable pharmacy pricing and/or integrate their community based clinical management resources with Elixir and Rite Aid pharmacies.
Strategy
Our RxEvolution strategy is intended to transform us into the leading whole health destination that treats mind, body and spirit. We strive to fundamentally change our role in health care and become the industry leader in whole health. Our goal is to help our customers get beyond healthy and get thriving. 
Rite Aid seeks to deliver a fresh, differentiated experience across all channels by targeting our growth customer – women between the ages of 25 to 49 who take care of themselves, their children, aging parents, and even pets. During the past year the company has been building the foundation for an elevated customer experience. Rite Aid has been establishing on-trend supplier relationships, resetting categories representing over 75% of front end sales according to our new merchandising standards, delivering new and enhanced training, tools and work processes to all in-store associates, using LEAN methodology to free up pharmacists' time, modernizing its e-commerce infrastructure and online experience, and physically refreshing its fleet of stores. Together, this comprehensive approach is aimed at helping customers achieve a level of well-being that goes beyond traditional perceptions of healthy.
Elixir, our pharmacy benefits manager, offers compelling healthcare services to improve clinical outcomes, digital engagement tools and connection to our over 2,500 Rite Aid and Bartell Drugs retail stores. With our integrated offerings and solutions, Elixir provides mid-market employer groups and regional health plans with an alternative to the large, health-plan affiliated PBMs. 
As a healthcare company with a retail footprint that operates in many communities throughout the country and engages over one million customers per day through our various lines of business, we believe we are positioned to continue making a meaningful difference in the lives of our customers, associates and neighbors.
Products and Services
Sales of prescription drugs for our Retail Pharmacy segment represented approximately 66.7%, 67.0% and 66.6% of our total drugstore sales in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, prescription drug sales were $10.9 billion, $10.4 billion and $10.4 billion, respectively. See the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Continuing Operations” and our consolidated financial statements.

We carry a full assortment of non-prescription, or front-end, products. The types and number of front-end products in each store vary, and selections are based on customer needs and preferences and available space. No single front-end product category contributed significantly to our sales during fiscal 2021. Our Retail Pharmacy segment’s principal classes of products in fiscal 2021 were the following:
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​
-----------------------------------------------+---+---------------+--
​ | | Percentage of | 
Product Class | | Sales | ​
Prescription drugs | | 66.7 | %
Over-the-counter medications and personal care | | 10.8 | %
Health and beauty aids | | 4.8 | %
General merchandise and other | | 17.7 | %

​
We offer a wide variety of own brand products to meet the needs of our customers in virtually every non-pharmacy department. We intend to increase our private brand sales and penetration in fiscal 2022 by expanding our assortment, redefining our brand architecture and brand names, refreshing our package design, and driving greater support through our marketing. We believe that today’s consumer expects high quality differentiated own brand products that deliver performance equal to national brands at a better value. A refresh our own brand offering is critical to improving our gross margin and reducing our working capital investment in inventory.
We have a strategic alliance with GNC under which we have opened 1,652 GNC stores within Rite Aid stores as of February 27, 2021, and have a contractual commitment to open at least 33 additional GNC stores within Rite Aid stores by December 2021. We believe the GNC stores enhance our wellness offerings and help differentiate us from our competitors. GNC is a leading nationwide retailer of vitamin and mineral supplements, personal care, fitness and other health-related products.
Through Elixir, we provide a fully integrated suite of PBM offerings including technology solutions, mail delivery services, specialty pharmacy, network and rebate administration, claims adjudication and pharmacy discount programs. In addition to its PBM offerings, Elixir also offers fully integrated mail-order and specialty pharmacy services through Elixir Pharmacy. Through Elixir Insurance (“EI”), Elixir also serves seniors enrolled in Medicare Part D. In addition, Elixir, through its Laker Software, performs prescription adjudication services for its own claims.
Technology
All of our stores are integrated into a common pharmacy system, which enables our customers to fill or refill prescriptions in any of our stores throughout the country, identifies adverse drug interactions, and enables our pharmacists to fill prescriptions more accurately and efficiently. Our customers may also order prescription refills online, at www.riteaid.com, using our mobile app, or over the phone through our telephonic automated refill systems for pick up at a Rite Aid store or home delivery from a majority of our stores. We have automated pharmacy dispensing units in high volume stores, which are linked to our pharmacists’ computers that fill and label prescription drug orders. We utilize central fill technology to facilitate the automated picking, packaging, and labeling of prescriptions in a central filling location, which are sent to certain retail stores for delivery to the customer. We also utilize workload sharing technology within our stores, whereby stores within a close proximity can shift the fulfillment of prescriptions to stores with excess capacity. The efficiency of these processes allows our pharmacists to spend more time consulting with and answering our customers’ questions and concerns about their prescription medications and health conditions. Additionally, each of our stores employs point-of-sale technology that supports sales analysis and recognition of customer trends. This same point-of-sale technology facilitates the maintenance of perpetual inventory records which, together with our sales analysis, drives our automated inventory replenishment process.
We launched our new website, mobile application, and e-commerce solution in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.  This personalized user experience is built on a modern and scalable platform that will serve as the foundation for our digital and omni-channel solutions. Through RxEvolution, we will continue to enhance and modernize the technology platforms that support our company, with a meaningful focus on customer experience and design.

10



We continue to enhance our Elixir mobile app with a focus on providing members with the best and most effective low cost medications, in a manner that is completely personalized. It will not simply facilitate transactions, but rather advance a members ability to improve whole health.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
Since fiscal 2015, under our pharmaceutical purchasing and delivery agreement (“Purchasing and Delivery Agreement”) with limited exceptions, we purchased all of our branded pharmaceutical products and almost all of our generic (non-brand name) pharmaceutical products from McKesson. If our relationship with McKesson were disrupted, we could temporarily experience difficulties filling prescriptions for branded and generic drugs until we execute a replacement wholesaler agreement or develop and implement self-distribution processes.
We purchase our non-pharmaceutical merchandise from numerous manufacturers and wholesalers. We believe that competitive sources are readily available for substantially all of the non-pharmaceutical merchandise we carry and that the loss of any one supplier would not have a material effect on our business.
We sell private brand and co-branded products that generally are supplied by numerous sources. The GNC branded vitamin and mineral supplement products that we sell in our stores are developed by GNC, and along with our Rite Aid brand vitamin and mineral supplements, are manufactured by GNC.
Customers and Third Party Payors
During fiscal 2021, our stores filled approximately 164.1 million prescriptions and served over one million customers per day. The loss of any one customer would not have a material impact on our results of operations.
In fiscal 2021, substantially all of our pharmacy sales were to customers covered by third party payors (such as insurance companies, prescription benefit management companies, government agencies, private employers or other managed care providers) that agree to pay for all or a portion of a customer’s eligible prescription purchases based on negotiated and contracted reimbursement rates. During fiscal 2021, the top five third party payors accounted for approximately 77.9% of our pharmacy sales. The largest third party payor, Caremark, represented 30.4% of our pharmacy sales. The loss of, or a significant change to the prescription drug reimbursement rates by, a major third party payor could decrease our revenue and harm our business.
During fiscal 2021, Medicaid and related managed Medicaid payors sales were approximately 17.9% of our pharmacy sales, of which the largest single Medicaid payor was approximately 1.3% of our pharmacy sales. During fiscal 2021, approximately 39.6% of our pharmacy sales were to customers covered by Medicare Part D.
Through our Pharmacy Services segment we provide innovative pharmaceutical solutions for our clients which are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, managed Medicaid plans, Medicare plans, and other sponsors of health benefit plans, and individuals throughout the United States.
During fiscal 2021, Medicare Part D payor revenue was approximately 51.4% of our Pharmacy Services Segment revenue, of which the largest single Medicare Part D payer was approximately 36.6% of our Pharmacy Services Segment revenue. During fiscal 2021, approximately 19.3% of our Pharmacy Services Segment revenue was to customers covered by Commercial payors.  During fiscal 2021, approximately 12.1% of our Pharmacy Services Segment revenue was to customers covered by Medicaid payors.
Competition
The retail drugstore and pharmacy benefit management industries are highly competitive. Many of our competitors are larger, better capitalized, have access to greater financial and other resources, are diversified through other industries and have an international presence. Additionally, some of our competitors are vertically integrated, allowing them to leverage healthcare, health plan, and PBM operations together with their retail pharmacy footprint. Increasingly, these competitors are expanding in our existing markets. Greater competition exerts pressure on our pricing and promotional models and may force us to modify or reduce our prices.

11



Our retail drugstore operations compete with, among others, retail drugstore chains, such as Walgreens and CVS, along with independently owned drugstores, supermarkets such as Kroger, mass merchandisers like Walmart and Target, discount stores, wellness offerings, dollar stores and mail order and internet pharmacies. We compete on the basis of store location, payor access, convenience, price, customer service, and product selection.
Our pharmacy benefit management company competes with other pharmacy benefit managers, such as Caremark, Express Scripts, OptumRx and mid-market PBMs. We will increasingly compete on the basis of our PBM service offerings flexibility, clinical offerings, network management, Rite Aid as an anchor (in Rite Aid markets), omni-channel consumer engagement and the strength of client facing teams.
We believe continued consolidation in the healthcare industry, and the aggressive pricing by supermarkets and mass merchandisers and other PBM service providers will further increase competitive pressures in our industries.
Marketing and Advertising
In fiscal 2021, we advanced efforts to provide a seamlessly connected omni-channel customer experience. We continued to take a holistic approach to managing our media mix while shifting towards a digital-centric strategy. Marketing and advertising expense was approximately $122.7 million. This spend encompasses digital marketing to support pharmacy and front end sales, the wellness+ program and customer relationship marketing, in-store communication, weekly circular (print and digital), marketing campaign support including television, radio, and direct mail. During fiscal 2021, our marketing activities were primarily focused on the following:

● | Relaunching the Rite Aid brand through in-store, digital, broadcast, and print media. This was a significant portion of our marketing spend, and we continue to reinforce the new brand proposition into fiscal 2022. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reinforcing the new Rite Aid brand position of fusing traditional and alternative remedies to support immunity.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Supporting the launch of new items and brands as part of our merchandising refresh, including the support of new own brand items.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continued optimization of print media to drive marketing spend into more efficient and effective digital channels. We executed a multi-phase test and control program to determine where print advertising was less productive than digital spend, and adjusted marketing investment by channel throughout the year based on these learnings. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continued weekly promotional marketing as an important component of our marketing message mix, as we focused on promotions of items and categories that were most relevant to our customers during COVID-19.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Supported our free wellness+ rewards loyalty program as a component of our customer proposition.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Supported market-specific initiatives and individual store programs such as grand openings for new and remodeled stores (including the launch of our new store prototype)
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Focused efforts on our omni-channel marketing initiatives including our Rite Aid mobile app, social media, our riteaid.com website and e-commerce
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Additional programs focused on safety and convenience during the pandemic such as free delivery, ancillary immunizations and COVID-19 testing

Human Capital
Overview
​
As a healthcare company that operates in communities throughout the country and supports the whole health of millions of customers through our various lines of business, Rite Aid is positioned to make a meaningful difference in 

12



the lives of our customers. Our mission is to keep our communities healthy and thriving, and at the core of that mission is our associates. 
​
We believe our associates are integral to the success of our business transformation, through our RxEvolution strategy. In order to transform and grow our business, it is important for us to invest in our associates, giving them opportunities to grow professionally, care for themselves and their families, work in diverse and inclusive environments and be whole health ambassadors in their communities.
​
As of February 27, 2021, we employed over 50,000 associates across the United States, including Puerto Rico.
​
Communication and Engagement
​
Because our associates are so essential to our business strategy, we engage with them to measure and understand their perspectives and gather critical feedback. For the past two years, more than 70% of our associates have participated in our annual and periodic pulse associate surveys. The surveys give us valuable information regarding topics such as career development and growth, well-being, compensation, benefits, recognition, and leadership effectiveness. 
​
Training and Development
Growing and developing our talent is key to our future and our ability to lead at our best every day. We seek to inspire a high-performance culture and promote talent development. We offer development on leadership, safety, compliance and other critical business skills. We offer various instructor-led and virtual instructor-led programs and maintain a vast curriculum of relevant, on-demand learning and development resources. 
We also provide discounted tuition and reimbursement programs for associates to pursue degrees at select colleges or universities. We have recently been certified as an ACEP, Accredited Provider of Continuing Pharmacy Education, which will allow us to offer courses that count toward the CE licensing requirements of our pharmacists. In addition, we offer an accredited pharmacy technician certification program. Both efforts allow us to develop pharmacy associates to meet the demands of our business.

Our goal is to grow leaders at all levels and provide associates best-in-class opportunities to develop and grow the skills needed to meet personal goals and support Rite Aid’s future growth and success. 
​
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
​
We are proud to be a part of diverse communities with associates and customers that reflect the diversity of those communities. As such, we believe that an inclusive and welcoming culture is essential. We are committed to building a workplace in which every associate is appreciated and respected for their uniqueness and differences. We are transforming our business by viewing health and wellness through the lens of both traditional medicines and alternative remedies; we just don’t want to get healthy - we want to get thriving. On a parallel path, our approach to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion is intended to also be transformative. We just don’t strive to increase diversity; we want our talent to thrive. 
We are focused on strengthening our DEI infrastructure which includes the development of a DEI team (a Center of Excellence) and DEI integrated strategy that will address talent processes such as talent acquisition, talent development and talent management. A key focus will be to develop solutions that seek to enhance the work environment so our associates can perform to their best potential and provide an optimum customer experience. 
​
As of December 31, 2020 67% of associates self-reported as female. In addition, associates reported their race/ethnicity as: White 56%; Hispanic 15%; Black 13%; Asian 11%; and Other 5%.

Total Rewards and Recognition
​
We design compensation and benefit programs to support, recognize and reward performance of our associates. Included within the package of offerings for associates are annual bonuses, 401(k) plans, healthcare benefits, paid time off, life and disability coverage, merchandise discounts, and many other services and programs. In addition, we offer our associates wellness programs and tools for whole health in areas of importance such as mental health, disease management and financial wellness. 
​
We also value and encourage associate recognition in order to celebrate outstanding contributions. We’ve recently added financial incentives into our recognition platform, and we utilize this tool to both celebrate the great achievements of our teams and create a community experience for our workforce. 
​
COVID-19 Response
​
Rite Aid associates have been at the heart of our response to the pandemic, providing communities with medications, essential supplies, COVID-19 related information, COVID-19 tests, and COVID-19 vaccines.
​
During fiscal 2021, we supported our associates and their families in the following ways: bonuses and additional pay for our frontline associates who were working directly for and with our customers; pandemic pay for associates who tested positive or who were required to quarantine due to exposure; additional 15% associate discount; and job protected administrative leave for associates who did not feel comfortable coming to work due to health concerns. Additionally, the separately funded Rite Aid Foundation Associate Relief Fund provided over $3 million in assistance to grant recipient associates experiencing COVID-19 related hardships through financial support payments. As the safety of our customers and associates were our top concern, we also enacted protocols around cleaning, safety and social distancing.
​
Research and Development
We do not make significant expenditures for research and development.
Licenses, Trademarks and Patents
The Rite Aid name is our most significant trademark and the most important factor in marketing our stores and private brand products. Additionally, we utilize important tradenames for our Elixir operations and the recently acquired Bartell Drugs. We hold licenses to sell beer, wine and liquor, cigarettes and lottery tickets. As part of our strategic alliance with GNC, we have a license to operate GNC “stores-within-Rite Aid-stores.” We also hold licenses to operate our pharmacies and our distribution facilities. Through our 100% owned subsidiary Elixir, we hold a license to conduct Medicare Part D business with CMS.
Collectively, these licenses are material to our operations.
Seasonality
We experience seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations concentrated in the first and fourth fiscal quarters as the result of the concentration of the cough, cold and flu season and the holidays. We tailor certain front-end merchandise to capitalize on holidays and seasons. We increase our inventory levels during our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the seasonal fluctuations described above. Our results of operations in the fourth and first fiscal quarters may fluctuate based upon the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season, both of which are unpredictable.
Regulation
Our business is subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations, and administrative practices concerning the provision of and payment for health care services, including, without limitation: federal, state and local licensure and registration requirements concerning the operation of pharmacies and the practice of pharmacy; Medicare, Medicaid and 

14



other publicly financed health benefit plan regulations prohibiting kickbacks, beneficiary inducement and the submission of false claims; the ACA; regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S Consumer Product Safety Commission, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, including regulations governing the purchase, sale, storing and dispensing of controlled substances, listed chemicals, and other products, as well as regulations promulgated by state and other federal agencies concerning automated outbound contacts such as phone calls, text messages and emails and the sale, advertisement and promotion of the products we sell, including nicotine products and alcoholic beverages. We are also subject to laws governing our relationship with our associates, including health and safety, minimum wage requirements, overtime, sick leave, working conditions, equal employment opportunity and unionizing efforts.
The legal environment affecting our business will continue to become more complex as new legal requirements and rules are introduced and existing laws are modified. Such legal changes could also create areas of uncertainty and require that we make material changes in our business operations and practices. Finally, any real or alleged non-compliance with these laws could materially and adversely impact our business and financial condition.
Legal Developments Relating to COVID-19
As one of the federal legislative responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, Congress enacted the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (the “Families First Act”) and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), which require insurers and other payors to provide coverage for COVID-19 related medical services, in many cases without member cost-sharing. Pursuant to the government’s implementation of COVID-19 related legislation, the Company has received reimbursement for furnishing COVID-19 related testing, vaccinations, and monoclonal antibody treatment. We received provider relief funds under the CARES Act. We also elected to defer paying our employer share of Social Security tax payments for the period beginning March 27, 2020, and we plan to remit such payments by making two equal installments on or about December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022. 
The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which was signed into law on March 15, 2021, authorized the government to spend approximately $1.9 trillion to address continued impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, including approximately $415 billion in increased funding to cover the national vaccination program, COVID-19 testing, contract tracing, research and development, and medical supply manufacturing. Our business began offering COVID-19 vaccinations in its stores during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 to eligible individuals based on state and local jurisdiction guidelines. 
In addition to the above legislation, we have operated pursuant to a large number of new laws, regulations, and directives from federal, state, county, and city authorities related to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the remainder of the COVID-19 pandemic and for some time thereafter, we anticipate additional mandates and directives, from federal, state, county, and city authorities. Such directives could include additional travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and shutdowns or the reinstitution of more stringent regulations (including mandatory stay at home orders). While there is uncertainty regarding the financial and operational impacts of COVID-19 related governmental actions and inactions, such impacts could be material and adverse or could require substantial and permanent changes in the Company’s operations. 
Health Care Fraud and Abuse Laws 
Because we submit claims and other information to Medicare, Medicaid, and other government-sponsored health care programs, the Company is subject to various health care fraud and abuse laws, including the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) and Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”), of which many states have similar state counterparts, as well as the federal Physician Self-Referral Law (“Stark Law”), and the beneficiary inducement provision of the Civil Monetary Penalties Law (“CMPL”). Violations of these laws can result in various forms of sanctions, including civil and criminal fines, treble damages, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in government-sponsored health care programs. FCA lawsuits can be initiated by the government or by individual whistleblowers who pursue qui tam actions on behalf of the government. In order to participate in government health care programs and mitigate our risks under the health care fraud and abuse laws, the Company maintains a compliance program. The Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) has the authority to monitor our operations and compliance efforts through audits and investigations, 

15



and noncompliance can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties and exclusion from future participation in government programs. 
Medicare Laws and Regulations
We participate in the federal government’s Medicare Part D program as a stand-alone Prescription Drug Plan (“PDP”) through our EI subsidiary, and our PBM business contracts to provide drug benefit administration services for other Medicare plans. Accordingly, we are subject to federal, state, and local regulations, including rules, guidance, memoranda, and updates published by CMS. This includes the governance set forth by the Medicare Part D program, which makes prescription drug coverage available to eligible Medicare beneficiaries through private insurers. This program regulates the provision of Medicare outpatient prescription drug coverage, including enrollment, formularies, pharmacy networks, marketing, and claims processing. Some Medicare regulations, including those governing pharmacy network, benefit designs, and product pricing, have been and may continue to be modified. 
CMS could decrease Medicare reimbursement or increase fees imposed upon PDPs. Among other things, PDPs could be required to pay Medical Loss Ratio (“MLR”) rebates for failure to meet minimum MLRs in a given year and repeated failure to meet such minimum annual thresholds can serve as a basis for program termination by CMS. Because our Medicare plan clients are subject to these same regulations, if they are negatively impacted by legal noncompliance or unexpected reimbursement cuts, they could seek to terminate or renegotiate contractual arrangements with our Company. 
CMS assesses the quality of PDPs through star ratings, which may impact beneficiary enrollment numbers and sustained negative star ratings can result in plan termination. PDPs that fail or are unable to achieve or maintain star ratings can be terminated from Medicare.
Pharmacy, Professional Licensure, and Controlled Substance Laws and Regulations
We are subject to a wide range of statutes and regulations at the federal and state levels regarding the practice, licensure, and professional regulation of pharmacy and nursing. These statutes and regulations govern our retail, mail order, and specialty pharmacy operations, as well as the professional conduct of our pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, nurses, and physician assistants. Federal and state law also governs the regulation of prescriptions, drug products, and controlled substances. Governmental agencies with regulatory authority to audit and/or investigate our Company’s operations in this area include, but are not limited to CMS, DEA, DOJ, FDA, state pharmacy boards, state nursing boards, state controlled substance regulators, and the state attorneys general. These agencies are authorized to impose criminal, civil, and administrative law sanctions for failure to comply with these laws and regulations. 
HIPAA, Privacy, and Security Laws
Our business is also subject to patient and consumer privacy obligations, including corporate, pharmacy and associate responsibility imposed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), as modified by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, including the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act. As a HIPAA covered entity, we are required to implement privacy standards, train our associates on the permitted uses and disclosures of protected health information (“PHI”), report breaches of PHI, provide a notice of privacy practices to our pharmacy customers and permit pharmacy customers to access and amend their records and receive an accounting of disclosures of PHI. We are also subject to regulations governing the receipt of remuneration in exchange for PHI and are subject to audit for HIPAA compliance and failure to satisfy HIPAA standards may result in civil and criminal penalties. Corresponding state health privacy laws also apply to our business to the extent they are more stringent than HIPAA, and require additional compliance efforts that may vary by state.
Data Protection and Cybersecurity Laws 
Our business is subject to federal and state privacy and data security laws, with respect to our receipt, use and disclosure by us of personally identifiable information (“PII”), which laws require us to provide appropriate privacy and security safeguards for such information. The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 invites business entities to 

16



share cyber threat indicators with the federal government and directs HHS to create a set of voluntary cybersecurity best practices for health care entities. In addition, we are subject to the recently enacted California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which established numerous consumer rights including rights of access and deletion of consumer’s data upon request. The approved California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”) with a January 1, 2023 compliance deadline amends and expands the CCPA. Similarly, Virginia has enacted the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“CDPA”), which goes into effect on January 1, 2023, and provides for consumer privacy rights and protections that are in many ways similar to those in the California law, although the CDPA does not include a private right of action. Other states are considering laws that would give consumers increased control over their personal data. Courts also may adopt the standards for fair information practices promulgated by the FTC that concern consumer notice, choice, security, and access. Likewise, a number of states that have passed data safeguard legislation, most notably New York’s Stop Hacks and Improve Electronic Data Security Act (the “SHIELD Act”), signed into law in July 2019, that requires any person or business owning or licensing computerized data that includes the private information of a resident of New York to implement and maintain reasonable safeguards to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the private information. We are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard promulgated by the payment card industry in connection with handling credit card data. This standard contains requirements devised to aid entities that process, store or transmit credit card information to maintain a secure environment.
Our business faces a significant compliance burden in seeking to satisfy federal as well as multiple and sometimes inconsistent state laws regarding privacy and data security. We further anticipate the introduction of new state data security laws that could increase our compliance burdens or negatively impact our future business plans and operations. Additionally, many of the public health insurance exchanges (“Public Exchanges”) governed by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) impose their own privacy and security standards. Because these standards may impact downstream entities, such as PBMs, they may impose additional compliance burdens for our business.
Consumer Protection Laws 
Our business is required to comply with certain federal and state consumer protection laws. Applicable federal laws include the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Federal Postal Service Act, and the Consumer Product Safety Act. Our retail pharmacies and clinics are also subject to federal and state laws regarding the accessibility of goods and services to people with disabilities. Moreover, our website operations and electronic marketing and customer communications must be employed in compliance with certain consumer protection requirements. Under these laws, regulated entities may be subject to legal action and government investigations in regards to a wide array of customer-facing matters, including product pricing and expiration, disability access, and member loyalty and other financial incentive programs. 
Telemarketing and Other Outbound Contacts
The Company engages in certain telemarketing activities that involve outbound phone calls, texts and emails. Accordingly, we are subject to various federal and state laws, including, but not limited to the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act and the federal Telemarketing Sales Rule, under which federal and state regulators and private individuals may be authorized to take legal action and seek financial penalties for violations. 
The Affordable Care Act
The ACA made broad and far-reaching changes to the U.S. health care system and increased access to coverage for persons who may be our patients or enrollees through federally-subsidized coverages. Among other things, the ACA expanded the Medicaid program eligibility in states that accepted federal incentives on such expansion. Pursuant to the ACA, the Company’s PBM and PDP businesses, and its health plan clients, have also been subjected to greater government oversight and regulation, including in relation to minimum MLR requirements, benefit plan design mandates, and group rating and pricing practices. Parts of the ACA continue to change over time through federal and state regulatory and policy actions and related litigation. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule on a major legal challenge to the constitutionality of the ACA and the U.S. Congress could take action to repeal, modify, or expand the ACA in the future. While the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 increased federal subsidies for insurance obtained under the health exchange marketplace, this increase is temporary and it is unclear whether or not Congress will extend 

17



the subsidies beyond their current expiration date at the end of 2022. As a result, there is significant uncertainty regarding the ACA and its ongoing impacts. Furthermore, any changes to the ACA and any state responses to such changes could have a significant adverse effect on our business operations and finances. 
340B Drug Pricing Program 
Under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, which is overseen by HHS and the Health Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”), drug manufacturers are required to sell outpatient prescription drugs to certain safety net covered entities at discount prices. Drugs covered under the 340B Program may be dispensed by the covered entity or through contract pharmacies. In recent years, there has been litigation and enforcement actions regarding the dispensing of program drugs by contract pharmacies and the payment of mandatory 340B Program drug discounts by drug manufacturers. To the extent these actions could restrict the scope of the 340B Program or contract pharmacy arrangements, our Company’s participation in the program could be significantly impacted. Congressional action with respect to the program might also have an impact. 
Environmental, Safety, Hazardous Materials Laws
In connection with the ownership and operations of our stores, distribution centers and other sites, we are subject to laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local levels relating to the protection of the environment, public health, and occupational safety matters, including those governing the management and disposal of hazardous substances and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Failure to comply with such laws or regulations could result in fines or other government-imposed sanctions.
Pharmacy Network, Audit, and Plan Design Legislation 
Medicare Part D and many states have implemented “any willing provider” laws and related legal provisions that regulate the ability of drug benefit plans and PBMs to utilize limited pharmacy networks. In addition, an increasing number of states have imposed conditions restricting or modifying the ability of health plans and PBMs to audit pharmacies and recover overpayments. Finally, CMS and the various states may regulate the design and structure of prescription drug formularies with regard to Medicare Part D and ACA-regulated plans. Some of these regulations may limit the ability of PBMs and health plans to impose formulary conditions or restrictions, such as copayment differentials and drug tiering designs, which may be used to manage drug benefits and promote cost-efficient utilization. These laws can significantly affect the ability of PBMs to develop and enforce pharmacy networks, formularies, and other plan design features to manage costs and to effectively conduct audits aimed at recovering overpayments for our health plan clients. 
Medicare November 2020 Rebate Rule
Our Medicare PDP and PBM businesses could be impacted by the HHS final rule issued in November 2020, which would eliminate AKS safe harbor protection for rebates offered by drug manufacturers to PDPs and their contracting PBMs in exchange for formulary placement. The final rule would replace the previous safe harbor with two narrower safe harbors, one of which applies to certain point-of-sale rebates and the other to certain fixed service fees paid by manufacturers to PBMs. The final rule has been the subject of industry legal challenge, and pursuant to a court order, its implementation date has been delayed until at least January 1, 2023. It is currently unclear whether the final rule will survive legal challenge and be implemented as currently drafted, or whether it will be struck down, modified, or rescinded. Moreover, even if implemented in its current form, it is unclear what the final rule’s resulting impact could be to the Company and its PBM and PDP businesses. 
Pharmacy Pricing Legislation
An increasing number of states are regulating Maximum Allowable Cost reimbursement (“MAC”), which may be employed by PBMs to regulate generic drugs costs. State MAC laws are frequently designed to regulate MAC pricing methodologies, price transparency, the types of drugs subject to MAC pricing, and MAC pricing appeals by pharmacies. In December 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court held that an Arkansas law that regulated PBM activities relating to MAC 

18



pricing and procedures was not preempted under ERISA. This decision affords states greater latitude to enact and enforce MAC laws that could restrict the ability of PBMs to impose and enforce MAC pricing parameters to maximize cost efficiency.
Antitrust and Unfair Competition Laws 
The Company falls under the oversight of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and state regulatory authorities that are charged with investigating and enforcing laws relating to unfair and deceptive trade practices and “unfair methods of competition.” Some government investigations and prosecutions have focused on competitive and trade practices employed by PBMs with regard to rebates, drug pricing, and restrictive pharmacy networks, as well as various other business practices of PBMs and retail pharmacies. In addition, the federal government and most states have enacted antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive. Antitrust enforcement in the healthcare sector is currently a priority of the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice. Violations of federal or state antitrust and unfair trade practices laws and regulations could result in substantial statutory penalties and other sanctions. 
FDA Regulation
The Company’s business operations include, among other things, the distribution and dispensing of prescription drugs, the sale of over-the-counter medications and products, the private labeling of certain drug products and medical devices, and the sale of prepared food, all of which are regulated in whole or in part by the FDA. The FDA is authorized to impose various forms of sanction, including financial penalties, for failure to comply with regulations governing matters within its oversight. 
ERISA Regulation
Our PBM business provides prescription drug administrative services for various employer and union sponsored health plans, many of which are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”). In some cases, our PBM business may contract with a plan sponsor to assume limited fiduciary responsibilities and may be subject to direct civil and/or criminal liability under ERISA for any illegal remuneration provided to or received from plan sponsors. 
ERISA generally preempts state and local laws that relate to employee benefit plans, but there is a lack of clarity as to the scope of ERISA preemption, which has been a frequent subject of litigation. In December 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld an Arkansas law designed to restrict the ability of PBMs to impose certain financial and operational parameters on network pharmacies. To the extent that future cases further limit ERISA’s preemptive scope, PBMs could be increasingly subject to state-imposed legal requirements. 
PBM Laws and Regulations
Many states have implemented laws and regulations designed to more stringently regulate PBM activities, including by means of PBM licensure and registration requirements, restrictions on pharmacy audits, MAC pricing transparency, and restrictions on PBM pharmacy network designs and dispensing channels. In addition, various quasi-regulatory organizations and credentialing organizations have issued (or may propose) model standards or other requirements concerning PBMs, specialty pharmacies, or health plans. Examples include the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”), the National Committee for Quality Assurance (“NCQA”), and the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (“URAC”), among others. Cumulatively, these efforts could restrict PBMs’ leeway to manage costs and lead to greater inconsistency among state standards and laws, thereby increasing PBM compliance burdens.
PBMs are also subject to various federal and state fraud, waste, and abuse laws, including the FCA, AKS, and state false claims act and anti-kickback laws. Failure to comply with any of these laws could invite financial penalties and/or civil or criminal sanctions.

19



Government Agreements and Mandates
The Company may, from time to time, be subject to certain agreements or mandates imposed by federal, state, and local authorities in the form of consent orders, corporate integrity agreements, corrective action plans, and settlements. Currently, our business is subject to consent orders that pertain to information security, tobacco, pricing and product expiration dates.
Among other actions, the Company maintains a comprehensive security program designed to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of personal information collected from or about our consumers. Compliance with these consent orders requires regular assessments and reports and our compliance activities may occasionally be subject to audit or inspection. Any failure to abide by the terms of these consent orders could result in civil, criminal, or administrative remedies or penalties.
Consumer Financial Laws 
The Company offers various financial products and services at certain of our retail store locations that include money (wire) transfer services, bill payment, money orders, check cashing, prepaid gift cards, and digital payment platforms. Accordingly, our business is subject to certain international, federal, and state anti-money laundering and consumer financial laws. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in civil and criminal penalties as well as reputational harm.
Corporate Governance and Internet Address
We recognize that good corporate governance is an important means of protecting the interests of our stockholders, associates, customers and the community. We have closely monitored and implemented relevant legislative and regulatory corporate governance reforms, including provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”), the rules of the SEC interpreting and implementing Sarbanes-Oxley and the corporate governance listing standards of the NYSE.
Our corporate governance information and materials, including our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, Corporate Governance Guidelines, the charters of our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee, our Code of Ethics for the Chief Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers, our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct and our Related Person Transaction Policy are posted on the corporate governance section of our website at www.riteaid.com and are available in print upon request to Rite Aid Corporation, 30 Hunter Lane, Camp Hill, Pennsylvania 17011, Attention: Corporate Secretary. Our Board of Directors will regularly review corporate governance developments and modify these materials and practices as warranted.
