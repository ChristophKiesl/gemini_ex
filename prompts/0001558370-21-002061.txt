ITEM 1.BUSINESS
Overview
Glaukos is an ophthalmic medical technology and pharmaceutical company focused on developing novel therapies for the treatment of glaucoma, corneal disorders, and retinal disease. We developed Micro-Invasive Glaucoma Surgery (MIGS) to serve as an alternative to the traditional glaucoma treatment paradigm and launched our first MIGS device commercially in 2012. We have developed a proprietary bio-activated pharmaceutical therapy for the treatment of a corneal disorder, keratoconus, that was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2016. We are also developing a pipeline of surgical devices, sustained pharmaceutical therapies, and implantable biosensors intended to treat glaucoma progression, corneal disorders such as keratoconus, dry eye and refractive vision correction, and retinal diseases such as neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic macular edema (DME), and retinal vein occlusion (RVO).
Ophthalmic diseases and disorders are a national and global health concern and, as the population ages, the number of individuals with vision impairment and blindness is increasing. Moreover, improving access to cost-effective tools is increasing the diagnosis of sight-threatening ocular diseases globally and driving demand for innovative products, technologies, and therapies that improve clinical outcomes, and provide ease of use and reliability. In response to the significant unmet needs that exist within ophthalmology we have designed commercial and development-stage solutions to provide ophthalmologists with treatment options.
Our commercial solutions and development-stage product candidates include:
•MIGS products that primarily involve the insertion of a micro-scale device or drug delivery system designed to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) by restoring the natural aqueous humor outflow pathways for patients suffering from glaucoma and MIGS biosensors to measure pressure within the eye; 
•topical pharmaceuticals that are bio-activated on the eye by one of our proprietary systems intended to strengthen, stabilize, and reshape the cornea for patients impacted by corneal ectatic disorders or refractive disorders; and
•topical pharmaceuticals that are applied to the eyelid and meant to treat dry eye, glaucoma and other ocular surface diseases and disorders, and
•proprietary micro-invasive, bio-erodible sustained release drug delivery implants that are designed to elute pharmaceuticals over time to improve the vision of patients impacted by retinal diseases such as AMD, DME, RVO, and diabetic retinopathy (DR).
Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic and Current Economic Environment
​
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a “pandemic,” spreading across the globe and impacting worldwide economic activity. In the U.S., certain federal, state and local governmental authorities issued stay-at-home and other orders, proclamations and/or directives, including restrictions on elective procedures and therapies, aimed at minimizing the spread of COVID-19. Although some of these governmental restrictions have since been lifted or scaled back, recent surges of COVID-19 have in some cases led, and future surges could lead, to the reinstitution of stay-at-home or other orders and may further result in restrictions being re-implemented in response to efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Even if stay-at-home or other orders are removed, potential patients may elect to stay at home voluntarily. The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent economic slowdown has materially impacted the global demand for our products, which are used in procedures and therapies that are considered elective. This decrease in demand was most significantly felt in the latter part of the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and the earlier part of the quarter ended June 30, 2020. Beginning in May 2020, we began to see an early recovery toward more normalized levels for cataract and

keratoconus procedures, a trend that continued through the quarter ended December 31, 2020. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations going forward is unknown and will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 outbreak, the status of health and safety actions taken to contain its spread and any additional preventative and protective actions that governments, or we, may take, any future surges of COVID-19 that may occur, the dynamics associated with the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines, and how quickly and to what extent economic and operating conditions normalize within the markets in which we operate. For additional information, see the section titled Risks Related to Our Business within Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​
We have taken a number of steps aimed at minimizing the spread of COVID-19 and protecting our employees, including shifting the majority of our workforce to remote operations, which continues through the date hereof. We have maintained streamlined manufacturing and assembly processes in order to consistently provide product to our customers who depend on us. In addition to other health and safety protocols that follow applicable guidance and regulations, employees involved in such operation-critical processes have been organized into a number of small shifts designed to minimize the time any one individual is required to be onsite. Further, in an effort to identify, and avoid further infection from, asymptomatic cases, we have offered periodic voluntary COVID-19 viral testing to on-site employees.
​
We also sought to preserve our cash position by instituting a number of cost saving initiatives, the majority of which have been reinstated, although we continue to carefully manage our discretionary spending. These actions were designed to preserve jobs and core research and development programs. Further, in June 2020, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $287.5 million of 2.75% convertible notes due 2027 (the Convertible Notes), the net proceeds of which will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash of approximately $413.9 million, compared to $183.3 million as of December 31, 2019. 
​
We continue to actively assess the impact of COVID-19 on our clinical trials and other pipeline products. The closure of ophthalmic practices and deferral of elective procedures beginning in the first quarter of 2020 in response to COVID-19 disrupted new patient enrollment in our ongoing clinical trials. This disruption has continued even as facilities have reopened as doctors prioritize their standard procedures over clinical trial enrollment. In particular, patient enrollment for our iDose clinical trials remains impacted, which has delayed our estimated iDose approval timeline, where we now expect a potential FDA approval of this product in 2023. 
​
Material Changes and Transactions
Glaukos was formed in 1998 with a focus on treating glaucoma progression, initially developing MIGS to serve as an alternative to traditional glaucoma treatment and management paradigms. We launched the iStent, our first MIGS device, in the U.S. in 2012, our next-generation iStent inject device in late 2018, and our latest iStent inject W device in the second half of 2020, while also developing a broader portfolio of development-stage product candidates designed to treat glaucoma progression. In recent years, we began to execute a long-term strategy that leverages our core competencies and extends our focus to include therapies for chronic eye diseases beyond glaucoma into corneal disorders and retinal health. 
In June 2020, we issued $287.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.75% convertible notes due 2027 (the Convertible Notes), the proceeds of which are expected to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.
Products and Pipeline
The Company operates in one operating segment as our primary business activity is the development and commercialization of therapies across several end markets within ophthalmology. In an effort to provide greater visibility into our performance and progress, the following discussion is presented based on our three principal franchises: glaucoma, corneal disorders and retinal diseases.

2



Glaucoma
Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases characterized by progressive, irreversible and largely asymptomatic vision loss in which elevated levels of IOP are often associated with optic nerve damage that can cause blindness. While some glaucoma patients do not experience an increase in IOP, it is widely considered a major risk factor in glaucoma’s progression, and reduction in IOP is the only clinically proven treatment for the disease. Elevated IOP occurs when aqueous humor is not circulating normally or properly draining from the front part of the eye. 
We have three primary commercialized products designed to treat mild-to-moderate open-angle glaucoma, the iStent, the iStent inject, and the iStent inject W. The iStent, the iStent inject, and the iStent inject W are FDA-approved micro-bypass stents that improve aqueous humor outflow inserted through the small corneal incision made during cataract surgery. Our iStent, which reduces IOP by restoring the natural physiologic pathways for aqueous humor, was the first commercially available MIGS treatment solution. Our next generation iStent inject and iStent inject W devices include two stents pre-loaded in an auto-injection system designed to allow the surgeon to inject stents through a single corneal entry. The iStent, iStent inject, and iStent inject W procedures are currently reimbursed in the U.S. by Medicare and all major national private payors. The iStent and iStent inject technologies are commercially available in Japan, Brazil, Canada, Australia, and certain European Union (EU) and other countries, even though reimbursement may not always be available for all such procedures.
We are also developing several pipeline products, including the iStent Infinite, iStent SA and iDose TR, none of which have been commercialized. The iStent Infinite consists of three stents that are designed for use as a standalone procedure in patients with refractory glaucoma. In 2019, we completed patient enrollment of an IDE study of iStent Infinite in order to pursue future FDA clearance. Similar to the iStent inject and the iStent inject W, the iStent SA is a two-stent product that uses a different auto-injection inserter. However, the iStent SA is designed for use as a standalone glaucoma procedure. The iDose drug delivery system is a targeted injectable implant based on our micro-scale device-platform that is designed to continuously deliver therapeutic levels of medication from within the eye for extended periods of time. We commenced our Phase III IND clinical trial for iDose TR in 2018. Additionally, our glaucoma pipeline includes the extended release iDose (TREX), iDose (ROCK), iPrime and the IOP Sensor which are still in a research and development (R&D) stage. 
​
In addition to our organic R&D efforts, in 2019 we entered into a multi-year agreement with Santen, which appointed us to serve as the exclusive U.S. partner for the sale of the Preserflo MicroShunt, which is currently being studied in an FDA pivotal study and has not yet been approved by the FDA. The MicroShunt is an ab-externo device being developed for treatment of glaucoma where IOP is uncontrolled with maximum tolerated medical therapy or where progression of the disease warrants surgery. 
In addition, in 2018 we entered into a research and development collaboration agreement with D. Western Therapeutics Institute (DWTI) in which we are conducting the evaluation and development of novel intraocular products for the treatment of glaucoma using compounds from DWTI’s proprietary Rho Kinase inhibitor compound library. 
Corneal Disorders
The cornea, the eye’s outermost layer, is a clear, dome-shaped surface that functions best as a lens when the cornea is strong and shaped properly. The cornea is responsible for the majority of the eye’s total focusing power and corneal disorders, including ectasia, refractive vision errors and dry eye, among others, can cause vision impairment. Corneal ectatic disorders are comprised of a class of diseases characterized by an ectatic, or misshaped, cornea. Corneal ectasia is typically caused by a weakening of the cornea, which can be due to a number of factors, including genetic causes, adverse side effects from ophthalmic refractive procedures such as LASIK, or excessive eye rubbing. We are currently targeting two primary corneal ectatic disorders with our bio-activated pharmaceuticals: keratoconus and corneal ectasia following refractive surgery, although our therapies may also offer benefits to individuals with presbyopia and myopia. Keratoconus is mostly a hereditary, degenerative ectatic disease that is often first seen in older children or young adults in which the typically round, dome-shaped cornea progressively thins and weakens, causing a cone-like corneal bulge due to normal internal pressure of the eye. Corneal ectasia following refractive surgery is a serious complication that involves the cornea becoming weakened following a refractive procedure, such as LASIK, with symptoms similar to naturally occurring keratoconus. Refractive vision errors, or the inability of the cornea to 

3



properly focus light, are prevalent in the U.S. and abroad and include disorders such as presbyopia and myopia. Presbyopia is a natural part of aging due to the hardening of the eye’s crystalline lens over time, resulting in a loss of lens elasticity or the ability of the lens to change shape in order to focus incoming light on the retina. Myopia, or nearsightedness, is a vision condition in which close objects are seen clearly, but objects farther away appear blurred, and is usually caused by an elongation of the eyeball or a cornea having too much curvature. Presbyopia affects nearly everyone over the age of 40 while myopia first occurs in school-age children and typically progresses until about age 20.
Our pharmaceutical iLink therapies, a suite of novel single-use drug formulations that are bio-activated by our proprietary systems, address both keratoconus and corneal ectasia. These iLink therapies, bioactivated upon the delivery of ultraviolet A (UVA) light to the cornea induce a biochemical reaction called corneal collagen cross-linking, or corneal cross-linking (CXL). CXL strengthens, stabilizes and reshapes the cornea to treat corneal ectatic disorders. The KXL System, which delivers UVA light to a large portion of the cornea, is approved by the FDA for use in the U.S. following removal of the epithelium (often referred to as “iLink epi-off”), a procedure familiar to ophthalmologists. In May 2019, patient enrollment in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial was completed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our latest pharmaceutical iLink therapeutic system for the treatment of keratoconus without the removal of the epithelium (often referred to as “iLink epi-on”). We now expect a potential approval of iLink epi-on product in 2023, with the delay being primarily the result of our decision to change contract drug manufacturers in advance of completing registration batches and, ultimately, commercialization. Outside the U.S., our pharmaceutical therapies can also be administered with the KXL System to address corneal weakening caused by refractive surgery such as LASIK. Our next generation systems are being developed to provide metered beams of UVA light to a targeted portion of the cornea. Our pharmaceutical products bio-activated by these systems may also offer a means of improving the vision of patients with presbyopia, myopia or other corneal diseases. 
​
We have also entered into an exclusive global licensing arrangement with Intratus to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize a patented, non-invasive transdermal drug delivery platform designed for application on the eyelid in the treatment of dry eye disease, glaucoma, and other ocular surface diseases and disorders.
Retinal Diseases
Retinal diseases vary widely but universally affect the retina, a thin layer of tissue inside the back wall of the eye containing light-sensitive cells that convert light into neural signals. Most retinal diseases cause visual impairment, including blurred or distorted vision and vision loss. Our R&D efforts in our retinal franchise are focused on treating AMD, DME, RVO, and other retinal diseases. AMD is a progressive disease that occurs when the macula, the central portion of the retina, is impaired, which can result in severe vision problems. DME is highly prevalent among individuals with type 2 diabetes and is associated with DR, the impairment of small blood vessels in the retina caused by increased glucose levels. Advanced DR can lead to fluid leaking into the macula, which causes DME and severe vision impairment. RVO occurs when the flow of blood from the retina is blocked, often due to a blood clot blocking the retinal vein, which can result in severe vision problems. 
We are developing sustained release pharmaceutical retinal platforms leveraging our expanded pharmaceutical and sustained drug delivery R&D capabilities, including Triamcinolone Acetonide SR, Multi-Kinase Inhibitor SR and Anti-VEGF SR. If commercialized, these platforms would be designed to treat AMD, DME, RVO, and other retinal diseases. The focus of our retinal research and development efforts is to develop potential treatment options with a longer duration-of-effect than current standards of care products. 
Research & Development 
We devote significant resources to our R&D efforts, which are focused on developing new products, and enhancing the effectiveness, ease of use, safety, and reliability of our commercialized products. Our R&D objectives are:

● | to advance glaucoma patient care through continuous improvement of our MIGS technologies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | to further enhance treatment options for keratoconus, while expanding iLink and CXL indications to include treatment for certain refractive and other corneal conditions and developing pharmaceutical therapies for dry eye disease and other corneal disorders; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | to leverage our expertise in sustained pharmaceutical systems to identify and develop viable treatment options for retinal diseases such as AMD, DME and RVO.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A considerable portion of our R&D investment includes clinical trials and the collection of evidence that provide data for use in regulatory submissions and required post-market approval studies involving applications of our products. We expect our R&D and clinical expenditures to increase as we continue to devote significant resources to clinical trials and regulatory approvals of our pipeline products. We currently conduct R&D activities primarily in the U.S. but are expanding our clinical capabilities to sites outside the U.S.
Sales and Marketing
Our global sales efforts and promotional activities are currently aimed at ophthalmic surgeons and other eye care professionals and our primary customers include ambulatory surgery centers, hospitals and physician private practices. In the U.S., we sell our products through a direct sales organization. Outside the U.S., we sell our products through direct sales organizations in sixteen countries and a network of distribution partners in other markets where we do not have a direct commercial presence or maintain a modest commercial presence. In 2020, sales to customers inside and outside the U.S. accounted for 77% and 23% of our net sales, respectively. No single customer or distributor accounted for more than 10% of our total net sales in 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our iStent technologies, the iStent, the iStent inject, and the iStent inject W and related accessories, which comprise our key product family, accounted for approximately 80% of our net sales, while our iLink therapies accounted for approximately 20% of our net sales.
Competition
The medical technology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive. We may compete with many companies, including divisions of companies much larger than us that may have greater resources and name recognition, and smaller companies that compete against specific products or in certain geographies. Furthermore, new product development, discoveries, and technological change characterize the areas in which we compete. Our present or future products could be rendered obsolete as a result of advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other surgical or pharmaceutical therapy development. We must continue to develop and commercialize new products, technologies, and therapies to remain competitive in the ophthalmology industry. We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of clinical superiority supported by extensive data, and innovative features that enhance patient benefit, product performance, and safety.
The ophthalmic segment of the medical technology and pharmaceutical industries is dynamic and subject to significant change due to cost-of-care considerations, regulatory reform, industry and customer consolidation, and evolving patient needs. The ability to provide products, technologies, and therapies that demonstrate value, are reimbursed through government or third-party payors, improve clinical outcomes and provide ease of use and reliability is becoming increasingly important for companies within ophthalmology.
In glaucoma, our MIGS offerings primarily compete against Ivantis, however there are a considerable number of large and small companies providing more invasive surgical glaucoma technologies, laser-based therapies, and pharmaceuticals that may provide indirect competition or with whom we may compete should our broad clinical development pipeline be approved and commercialized. In corneal disorders, we have, under an orphan drug designation, the only FDA approved bio-activated pharmaceutical therapy for the treatment of keratoconus, but globally we compete against numerous providers of corneal crosslinking therapies such as PeschkeTrade GmBH. Our corneal disorder pipeline, if approved, would vastly expand our competition to numerous large companies such as AbbVie Inc., Alcon and Johnson & Johnson, and small companies that provide medical technology and pharmaceutical therapies for several areas including dry eye and refractive conditions. Our retinal health pipeline, if approved, may face substantial competition from large pharmaceutical companies such as AbbVie Inc., Novartis AG, Genentech/Roche, Regeneron, and Bayer, and there are also a considerable number of large and small companies with development efforts in the field.

Facilities, Manufacturing and Distribution 
Our corporate headquarters and our manufacturing operations for the iStent, iStent inject and iStent inject W are located in an approximately 98,000 square foot campus in San Clemente, California which is comprised of two main buildings. Our pharmaceutical therapies for keratoconus are primarily manufactured and supplied by third parties in the U.S. and Germany. We lease approximately 27,000 square feet of office and laboratory space in Waltham, Massachusetts, and our manufacturing operations for the majority of our proprietary systems are located in Burlington, Massachusetts, with some limited manufacturing operations in Dublin, Ireland. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we entered into an office building lease pursuant to which we lease one property containing three existing office buildings, comprising approximately 160,000 rentable square feet of space, located in Aliso Viejo, California (Aliso Facility). The term of the Aliso Facility lease commenced on April 1, 2019 and will continue for thirteen years, with an option to extend the lease for two additional five-year periods at market rates. We intend to relocate our corporate administrative headquarters, along with certain laboratory, research and development and warehouse space previously based in San Clemente, to the Aliso Facility. We currently intend to maintain manufacturing facilities for the iStent, iStent inject, and iStent inject W at our San Clemente location for the foreseeable future. Our international subsidiaries also lease facilities in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom.
Intellectual Property 
The strength of our competitive position depends substantially upon our ability to obtain and enforce intellectual property rights protecting our technology both domestically and internationally. We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, trade secrets and other similar intellectual property, as well as customary contractual protections and security measures used to protect our proprietary, trade secret information. 
In the aggregate, our intellectual property assets are of material importance to our business. We are significantly dependent on our patent and other intellectual property rights and the failure to protect such rights could negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patents or other intellectual property rights against others. For additional information see the section titled Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property within Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

As of December 31, 2020, we owned or exclusively licensed in certain fields of use over 300 issued patents, pending U.S. patent applications, issued foreign patents and pending foreign patent applications. We may, from time to time, choose to acquire or license additional patents and patent applications, or we may choose to abandon, sell, or license certain Company patents and patent applications, depending on our needs. The issued patents that protect our commercial products and current product pipeline expire between 2021 and 2038. 
Government Regulation
Our products and operations are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by federal, state, and local authorities, as well as foreign regulatory authorities. These governmental agencies regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, approval, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion and marketing, distribution, post approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of medical devices and drugs (including drug/device combination products) in their respective jurisdictions to assure the safety and effectiveness of medical products and pharmaceuticals for their intended use. In general, there has been a trend of increased regulation of medical device and drug products, which has resulted in, and will likely continue to result in, increased prices to bring new products to market.
Regulation & Reimbursement in the United States
The FDA has broad regulatory authority over medical devices and drugs in the U.S. The FDA regulates, among other things, product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting.

Medical Device Requirements
Each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires one of the following: (i) clearance under a 510(k) premarket notification;(ii) approval under a Premarket Approval (PMA) application; (iii) approval of a de-novo classification petition; or (iv) approval under an IDE. 
The FDA classifies devices into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturing and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class III devices, which include our iStent products that produce the majority of our revenue, are deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices and devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. Class III devices require FDA approval of the more demanding PMA application before marketing of a Class III device can proceed. 
​
PMA Approval Pathway
Class III devices typically require a PMA before they can be marketed. In a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended use, and the PMA must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. If the FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review of a PMA, although in practice, the FDA’s review can take up to several years. The FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the applicant or its third-party manufacturers’ or suppliers’ manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR. Even after a PMA approval, the FDA may require post-approval conditions to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including additional clinical studies or post-market surveillance. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval. Certain changes to an approved device, such as changes in manufacturing facilities, methods, or quality control procedures, or changes in the design performance specifications, which may affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, require submission of a PMA supplement. 
Clinical Trials of Medical Devices
Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA for a Class III device. All clinical investigations must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations. If the device presents a “significant risk,” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, showing with appropriate data that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. 
Regardless of the degree of risk presented by the medical device, clinical studies must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board (IRB) for each clinical site, which is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE. During a study, the sponsor and any clinical investigators are required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements. After a trial begins, the sponsor, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits.
Post-Market Regulation
​
After a device is approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
​

● | Establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

7




● | Labelling, advertising and promotion regulations, which require that promotion is truthful, not misleading, fairly balanced and provide adequate directions for use and that all claims are substantiated, and also prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Approval of product modifications of approved devices that affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of an approved device;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:
​

● | warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | refusing or delaying requests for approvals of new products or modified products;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | refusal to permit the export or import of our products; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

​

● | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

​
Drug Requirements
The development and commercialization of drug products is subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries. Before marketing in the U.S., a drug must undergo rigorous preclinical and clinical studies and an extensive regulatory approval process implemented by the FDA under the FDCA. 
Before commencing clinical studies in humans in the US, we must submit to the FDA an investigational new drug application (IND) that includes, among other things, the general investigational plan and protocols for specific human studies and the results of preclinical studies. Once clinical studies have begun under the IND, they are usually conducted in three phases and under FDA oversight. These phases generally include the following:
Phase 1. Introduction into patients or healthy human volunteers and is tested for safety, dose tolerance and pharmacokinetics.
Phase 2. Introduction into a limited patient population to assess the efficacy of the drug in specific, targeted indications, assess dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.

8



Phase 3. Expansion to further demonstrate clinical efficacy, optimal dosage and safety within an expanded patient population.
The results of drug development, preclinical studies and clinical studies must be submitted to the FDA as part of a New Drug Application (NDA). The NDA also must contain extensive manufacturing information. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) establishes timeframes for FDA review of NDAs and the 2007 Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act gave the FDA authority to require implementation of a formal Risk Evaluation and Management Strategy to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. At the end of the review period, the FDA communicates either approval of the NDA or a complete response listing the application’s deficiencies.
Once approved, the FDA may require post-marketing studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, to monitor the safety and effectiveness of approved drugs, and may limit further marketing of the drug based on the results of these post-marketing studies. 
If regulatory approval for a drug is obtained, the clearance to market the drug will be limited to those diseases and conditions approved by FDA and for which the drug was shown to be effective, as demonstrated through clinical studies and specified in the drug’s labeling. Even if this regulatory approval is obtained, a marketed drug, its manufacturer and its manufacturing facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA. The FDA ensures the quality of approved drugs by carefully monitoring manufacturers’ compliance with its current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) regulations, which contain minimum requirements for the methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing, processing, and packaging of a drug. The FDA may withdraw drug approval if compliance with post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety or quality issues are identified after the drug reaches the marketplace. 
We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including the power to withdraw approvals.
Health Care Regulatory Laws
Additional laws and regulations also govern our business operations and products in the U.S., including among others:

● | the federal health care Anti-Kickback Statute which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order, arrangement for, or recommendation of, items or services for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal health care programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.

● | the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires applicable manufacturers like us to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) information related to payments and other “transfers of value” made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report information regarding payments and transfers of value provided (starting in 2021) to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives.

Certain states also mandate implementation of corporate compliance programs, require compliance with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines, impose restrictions on manufacturer marketing practices, require registration or licensing of manufacturers and their sales representatives, and/or require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities. Some states have proposed or enacted legislation that will create new data privacy and security obligations for certain entities, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act that went into effect January 1, 2020. Violations of these laws may subject us to administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, including imprisonment of individuals, the imposition of significant fines, monetary penalties, and damages, exclusion from participation in (or reimbursement for our products from) federal health care programs like Medicare or Medicaid, imposition of compliance obligations or monitoring, curtailment or restructuring of our operations, and damage to our reputation. 
Reimbursement
Ambulatory surgery centers, hospitals and physician private practices that purchase our products typically bill various third-party payors, such as government programs, private insurance plans and managed care programs, to cover all or a portion of the costs and fees associated with the therapeutics or procedures in which our products are used and bill patients for any applicable deductibles or co-payments. In the U.S., physicians are typically paid separately from the facility for surgical procedures involving our products; however, there is no published Medicare payment schedule at the national level for physician payment amounts. The physician payment rate is left to the discretion of the regional Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs), with each MAC separately determining coverage and no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained from, or maintained by, the MACs. MACs have in the past, and may in the future, change coverage terms. 
​
In the U.S., no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement exists among third-party payors; coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. In addition, payors continually review new products for possible coverage and existing products for changes in coverage and can, without notice, deny coverage. 
​
One key aspect of reimbursement in the U.S. are the distinct billing codes that are used by healthcare providers to report the provision of medical procedures and the use of supplies for specific patients to payors. There are different categories of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes (Category I, II and III) based on the procedure or supply. Although we have received a permanent healthcare common procedure coding system J code for our Photrexa pharmaceutical therapies, we have only obtained temporary Category III CPT codes for the professional fees associated with CXL and iStent-related procedures. Prior to expiration, there are two options: submit an application to convert a temporary code to a permanent code or submit an application for a five-year extension of the temporary code. With the approaching expiration of our temporary Category III CPT code for the professional fees associated our iStent-related procedures, we have applied for a permanent Category I CPT code. In connection with this transition to a permanent code, both the physician fee and facility fee associated with the procedures using our iStent products will be reevaluated. In some cases, the physician fees and/or facility fees have been decreased at the time codes are transitioned from temporary to permanent. Further, even when a permanent billing code has been assigned to a product, there is no guarantee that coverage will be provided. 
Regulation & Reimbursement outside the U.S.
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing clinical trials, commercial sales and distribution of our products and reporting of payments to physicians. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain authorization before commencing clinical trials or obtain marketing authorization or approval of a product under the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside the 

10



U.S. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. In addition, certain countries have adopted transparency legislation that requires us to report contracts with or payments made to physicians in those countries and many have enacted anti-kickback laws and regulations, which generally prohibit the offer, receipt, or payment of remuneration in exchange for or to induce the use of our products.
Similar to the trend within the U.S., other major international markets are also moving toward more stringent regulatory frameworks for medical device and drug products. For example, in May 2017, the EU adopted a new regulatory scheme for medical devices under the Medical Device Regulation (MDR). The MDR is expected to become fully effective in May 2021 and will bring significant new requirements for many medical devices, including enhanced requirements for clinical evidence and documentation, increased focus on device identification and traceability, and additional post-market surveillance and vigilance, which could result in substantial additional expense.
The EU has also adopted increasingly stringent data protection and privacy rules that have and will continue to have a substantial impact on the use of patient data across the healthcare industry. The EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, became effective in May 2018 and applies across the EU and includes, among other things, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and significant fines for non-compliance.
Reimbursement
Outside the U.S., reimbursement levels vary significantly by country and by region within some countries. Reimbursement is obtained from a variety of sources, including government-sponsored and private health insurance plans, and combinations of both. Some countries require additional clinical data before granting or expanding coverage and reimbursement for our products. In general, obtaining broad-based reimbursement and adequate payment for new technologies is more difficult in these markets than in the U.S. Many countries require new medical technologies to not only be safe and effective, but also to be able to demonstrate clinical benefits that outweigh the costs when compared to the standard of care. As in the U.S., reimbursement decisions can change, resulting in the elimination or reduction of reimbursement payments, which could adversely affect our financial results and our ability to invest in and grow our business.
Other
Our operations and many of the products we manufacture or sell are subject to extensive regulation by numerous other governmental agencies, both within and outside the U.S. In the U.S., apart from the agencies discussed above, our facilities, operations, employees, products (their manufacture, sale, import and export) and services are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Health & Safety Administration, the Department of Labor, Customs and Border Protection, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Treasury, the Department of Justice and others. State agencies also regulate our facilities, operations, employees, products and services within their respective states. Government agencies outside the U.S. also regulate public health, product registration, manufacturing, environmental conditions, labor, exports, imports and other aspects of our global operations.
These regulatory agencies and any current or future legislation could impact our business operations, reimbursement for our products, and the healthcare environment generally, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Compliance with these regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position to date, but current or new legislation could have such an effect in the future. We cannot estimate the expenses we may incur to comply with potential new laws or changes to existing laws, or the other potential effects these laws may have on our business.
Human Capital Management 
Glaukos is committed to developing a comprehensive, cohesive and positive employee experience. We consider talent attraction, development, engagement and retention a key driver of our business success. As of December 31, 2020, we had 653 full-time employees. Our Board of Directors, through the Compensation, Nominating and Governance 

11



Committee, retains direct oversight of our human capital management process, including demographics, talent development, employee retention, material aspects of employee compensation as well as diversity and inclusion recruitment, retention and compensation efforts. Additionally, the Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee assists management with the implementation of the Company’s diversity strategy. We report on human capital matters at each regularly scheduled Board of Directors meeting and periodically throughout the year. The most significant human capital measures or objectives that we focus on in managing our business and our related human capital initiatives include the following:
​

● | Workforce Diversity: We believe that truly innovative companies must find new ways to address the marketplace’s needs and the most effective innovation happens when our workforce represents a diversity of ideas and experiences. We embrace diversity in our employee recruiting, hiring, and development practices. Our workforce was made up of 37% female employees and 39% racially or ethnically diverse employees as of December 31, 2020, with 34% and 23% of management positions being filled by female and racially or ethnically diverse individuals, respectively. During 2020, of the promotions that were earned within our workforce, 37% were earned by female employees and 32% were earned by racially or ethnically diverse employees.

​

● | Inclusion and Belonging: We strive to create a work environment that emphasizes respect, fairness and dignity and do not tolerate discrimination or harassment. Individuals are evaluated based on merit, without discrimination, including discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, citizenship, marital status, gender (including pregnancy), gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, age, disability, veteran status, or other characteristics protected by law. We are committed to providing equal opportunities to every member of our workforce.

​

● | Health, Safety, and Wellness: Above all else, we are dedicated to the safety and wellbeing of our employees. As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded in 2020, we quickly shifted to a remote work environment and provided employees with the resources necessary to effectively perform their job responsibilities. Additionally, we implemented changes to our manufacturing and distribution operations to include the use of personal protective equipment and ensure social distancing. In an effort to identify, and avoid further infection from, asymptomatic cases, we have offered periodic voluntary COVID-19 viral testing to on-site employees. Further, we adopted COVID-19 pay policies that provide our employees up to ten additional days of paid leave if they experience COVID-19 exposure or illness or to need time to care for exposed or ill family members.

​

● | Philanthropy and Volunteerism: We created the Glaukos Charitable Foundation to assist the company in its philanthropic endeavors. Glaukos has donated over $10 million worth of its products to assist individuals in need. Additionally, we regularly hold local volunteer events and fundraising campaigns, over 20 total in 2020, to encourage our employees to give back to our communities, a commitment that we further support by offering employees paid time off for charitable volunteering. One of our more impactful volunteer events involved Glaukos employees adopting over 50 disadvantaged families globally to help provide a more special holiday experience.

​

● | Training and Development: Employees receive regular development feedback through quarterly management reviews during which they are encouraged to cultivate new skills and opportunities. We coach our leaders to facilitate effective conversations and measure the effectiveness of these conversations by surveying our employees. In addition to training and development opportunities, all new employees are required to participate in substantial training seminars to introduce them to Glaukos’ business, pipeline and position within ophthalmology. We value knowledge and continuous improvement and conduct frequent informational sessions to further expose our employees to different departments, projects and business priorities.

​

● | Compensation and Benefits: To attract, retain and recognize talent, we aim to ensure merit-based, equitable compensation practices and strive to provide competitive compensation and benefit packages to our workforce. Employees at all levels are eligible for discretionary cash bonuses. To align employees

with the organization’s performance, all U.S. employees are eligible to receive new hire and annual awards of restricted stock units. In furtherance of our commitment to internal pay equity and pay transparency, Glaukos conducts an annual pay equity analysis to evaluate compensation distribution, which analysis is also conducted in connection with new hires, promotions and our annual affirmative action planning process. Despite the difficulties presented by COVID-19, we expanded our global benefits programs, including broadening our employee assistance program globally, adding elderly and childcare assistance and introducing parental leave for new and adoptive parents for U.S. based employees, and expanding access to our trackless paid time off policy.
