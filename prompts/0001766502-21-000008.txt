Item 1. Business
Overview
Chewy, Inc. began operating as Chewy.com in 2011 and, in October 2013, Chewy.com, LLC was formed as a Delaware limited liability company. On March 16, 2016, Chewy.com, LLC converted from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation and changed its name to Chewy, Inc. On May 31, 2017, Chewy, Inc. was acquired by PetSmart, Inc. (“PetSmart”). We completed the initial public offering (“IPO”) of our Class A common stock on June 18, 2019. Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “Chewy,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” refer to Chewy, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, we were controlled by PetSmart. PetSmart is wholly-owned by a consortium including private investment funds advised by BC Partners, La Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, affiliates of GIC Special Investments Pte Ltd, affiliates of StepStone Group LP and funds advised by Longview Asset Management, LLC, and controlled by affiliates of BC Partners.
On February 12, 2021, PetSmart completed a refinancing transaction, and in connection with such transaction, all shares of our common stock held by PetSmart and its subsidiaries were distributed to affiliates of BC Partners. Subsequent to the distribution, PetSmart no longer directly or indirectly owns any shares of our common stock. As a result of these events, we are also no longer a restricted subsidiary under PetSmart’s credit facilities and indentures.
Our mission is to be the most trusted and convenient online destination for pet parents (and partners) everywhere. We believe that we are the preeminent online source for pet products, supplies and prescriptions as a result of our broad selection of high-quality products, which we offer at competitive prices and deliver with an exceptional level of care and a personal touch. We continually develop innovative ways for our customers to engage with us, and partner with approximately 2,500 of the best and most trusted brands in the pet industry offering more than 70,000 products, to bring a high-bar, customer-centric experience to our customers.
Our Industry
We operate in a large and growing industry in the U.S., comprising of pet food and treats, pet supplies and pet medications, other pet-health products, and pet services.
“Pet humanization” and premiumization driving higher spending per pet
Pet parents increasingly view pets as part of the family and are willing to spend more on higher-quality goods and services for those family members. According to the American Pet Products Association (the “APPA”) 2020 Packaged Facts report (“Packaged Facts”), more than 90% of pet owners in 2020 considered their pets to be a part of their family. Furthermore, according to Packaged Facts, 73% of pet parents are willing to spend more on high quality foods that are viewed as healthier for their pets. 
Historical and projected growth in pet spending
According to Packaged Facts, spending on the overall pet market has grown from $73 billion in 2014 to an estimated $98 billion in 2020, or at a 5% compounded annual growth rate (“CAGR”) over that time. Packaged Facts projects the overall pet market to continue growing at a CAGR of over 6% through 2024, with retail pet food and treats projected to grow at a CAGR of over 5% annually over that time. Pet food and treat sales estimates from 2020 through 2024 were adjusted higher by 3% compared to pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic estimates from Packaged Facts .
Consistency of spending and resilience during economic downturns
Spending on pets is a necessity and most customers purchase frequently and at regular intervals. The pet industry is one of the most resilient categories during economic downturns because of the nature of the pet parent/pet relationship. For example, during the recession from 2008 to 2010, overall consumer spending in the U.S. declined while pet spending in the U.S. increased by 12%, according to the APPA. In 2010 alone, spending in the U.S. on entertainment decreased by 7.0%, food decreased by 3.8%, housing decreased by 2.0% and apparel and services decreased by 1.4%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, while spending on pets increased by 6.2%, according to the APPA.
Similar to the resiliency shown during the 2008 to 2010 recession, the pet industry experienced a significant increase in demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic despite the overall economic downturn, particularly within the e-commerce channel. Pet adoptions and fostering surged with “stay-at-home” orders further increasing demand and the continued humanization of pets. According to Packaged Facts’ April/May 2020 survey, only 16% of dog and cat owners agreed that they were spending less on pet food as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent economic downturn, with 5% strongly agreeing and over 40% agreeing that they were buying pet food online more often as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Rapid shift to online shopping, with significant remaining opportunity
The pet industry, like many others in the U.S., is experiencing a continued shift from in-store to online purchases and it appears that this migration has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, with tailwinds expected to continue for several years. In 2019, e-commerce claimed the top spot of pet food sales by channel as online shopping continues to take market share from brick-and-mortar retail. Packaged Facts reports that online shopping grew from 4% of U.S. pet product sales in 2014 to an estimated 27% in 2020 with over $10 billion of pet food and treats sold online. This represents an over 40% CAGR for online pet retail over that time frame. Packaged Facts estimates the e-commerce channel to rapidly increase to over 34% of the total pet food market by 2024, up from pre-pandemic estimates of 24% while all other channels are projected to remain flat or decline.
According to Packaged Facts’ April/May 2020 Survey of Pet Owners, 64% dog and cat owners agreed that more of their everyday spending was being done online, and 73% stated they feel safer buying things online as opposed to in a store. We believe that the secular trend toward online shopping will continue for a significant period as consumers look to benefit from the convenience of home delivery and subscription-based purchasing, as well as the heightened safety of a “contactless” shopping experience.
Growing trend of subscription-based purchasing
Additional Packaged Facts research indicates 58% of dog and cat owners like the idea of home delivery for pet food and over the past 12 months, 12% of online pet food purchases and 7% of treat purchases were subscription-based. We believe that the trend of increased subscription-based purchasing behavior within the broader secular trend toward online shopping supports higher levels of customer retention and revenue visibility.
Our Strengths 
•Chewy’s commitment to customer service is the core of our brand. 
◦Customer centricity. Everything about our company is organized around our commitment to provide an exceptional customer experience. We make the shopping experience easy and enjoyable, and that makes finding and buying the right product an amazing start to the customer journey. We provide competitive prices, customizable and convenient automatic reordering, fast and reliable order delivery, and innovative technology-driven services. 
◦Customer service expertise that is knowledgeable and empowered. Our customer service representatives (“CSRs”) share a common bond - they love pets. This shared passion is evident in every interaction they have with our customers, whether via phone, email, or interactive live-chat. In addition, contacting us is easy, with virtually all customer calls being answered in less than ten seconds. From the moment they join Chewy, our CSRs receive extensive training from our knowledgeable team, learning the ins and outs of the world of pets and our product offering. Thereafter, they continue learning about brands and pets of all types via recurring training. This allows them to further hone their ability to deliver highly specialized, informed, and authentic advice to our customers.
◦Engaging with customers on a personalized level. We empower our CSRs to go above and beyond for our customers, and they do so with the knowledge that our commitment to our customers is our number one priority. We engage with pet parents thousands of times per day, and we embrace the opportunity to “WOW” our customers each time, from surprising them with a hand-painted pet portrait to sending flowers to a family who has recently lost their pet. In addition, we have developed integrated technology that enables us to capture personalized profiles for each of our customers as well as their pets so that we may provide them with personalized recommendations. The expertise of our 
CSRs, combined with the powerful tools that we provide them, allows us to deliver a high-touch and high-quality experience to our customers, which we believe results in higher retention rates. 
•We offer the widest assortment of pet products available of any pet specialty retailer—and we continue to grow that assortment—which we offer at competitive prices. We carry approximately 2,500 carefully selected brands, representing the best and most popular products, and we regularly add new ones as we strive to offer everything that pet parents may want for their pets. In addition, we offer a wide range of free educational media (such as blogs, videos, and tutorials on our website, Be.Chewy.com) to enhance our product offering and the buying experience, helping pet parents choose the right product for their pet or find answers to commonly asked questions specific to their type of pet. In 2020, we also launched two innovative ventures that are valuable additions to our growing healthcare business and represent our first service-based offerings for pet parents: medication compounding and a telehealth service, “Connect with a Vet,” as part of our goal to make pet healthcare more affordable and accessible to pet parents. 
•Our highly efficient and effective distribution network provides exceptional delivery with ongoing cost advantages and superior customer service. The strategic placement of our fulfillment centers across the U.S. enables us to cost-efficiently ship to over 80% of the U.S. population overnight and almost 100% in two days. The high volume of our sales, high participation rate in our Autoship subscription program, and relatively low seasonality of our business allow us to optimize asset utilization across our network and lower our fixed and variable cost per unit and our inventory levels.
•We deploy capital efficiently. We invest cash flow generated from our existing customer base to attract new customers. Given the fast and consistent payback levels from our customers, we invest free cash flow in marketing to attract new customers. Additionally, we expect to continue to invest in technology and product innovation to continue scaling our platform, customer support, marketing efforts, and supply chain in order to drive growth. 
•Our technology platform is scalable. Our advanced technology platform was developed to enable us to grow our sales volume and increase the number of active customers while reducing marginal transaction and operational costs. Given the significant fixed-cost component of our technology platform, we expect that our cost per transaction will continue to decrease as our sales volume grows. The scalability and integrated nature of our technology platform also allow us to run our operations in a cost-efficient manner by decreasing the number of operational personnel and automating many of our planning and fulfillment processes. For example, we have significantly improved our processes for picking and packing orders through better forecasting, inventory placement, and optimal labor planning, as well as investing in automated fulfillment processes. Our customer service model, while “high touch,” provides our CSRs with up-to-date customer data and cutting-edge tools to optimize their productivity. As we continue to grow, we expect that we will be able to further scale our fixed costs. 
Our Strategy
•Continue to grow sales from our existing customer base. We seek to expand our share of our customers’ wallets by broadening the selection of products and services that we offer as well as improving customer engagement. Customers have historically spent more per purchase on our website and mobile applications after their first year as they discover the wide range of our product offering and the value proposition we provide. Our exceptional customer service and “WOW” programs help us retain customers and increase their level of engagement and spending. 
•Acquire new customers. We intend to increase brand awareness and reach new customers by investing free cash flow from our existing customer base in advertising and marketing to acquire new customers from existing and new channels. Given the high levels of customer satisfaction that we see from our customers, we believe that there is significant opportunity to grow our business as consumers become more aware of our brand and our strong value proposition.
•Leverage our technological and operational efficiencies. We believe that we can further improve our margins as we grow net sales, and we remain committed to achieving this. We expect to invest in technology and product innovation to continue scaling our platform, customer support, marketing efforts and supply chain. Our management team is committed to a disciplined use of capital designed to drive measurable improvements in unit economics and further improve our profitability. 
•Continue to grow our proprietary brands. In 2016, we launched our first hardgoods proprietary brand, Frisco, and in 2017, we launched two consumables proprietary brands, American Journey and Tylee’s. Millions of customers have tried and reordered at least one of our proprietary brands over the years. Our goal is to provide value to our customers by offering proprietary brands with compelling quality and pricing. We believe there is significant room to grow our proprietary brands through continued growth of our current brands and the launch of new ones.
•Expand further into pet healthcare. Complementing our existing over-the-counter and veterinarian diet offerings, we launched Chewy Pharmacy in July 2018, thereby broadening our pet healthcare offering and providing our customers with a one-stop shop for their prescription and special diet needs. In 2020, we further advanced this goal by launching two innovative ventures that are valuable additions to our growing healthcare business and represent our first service-based offerings for pet parents. In October 2020, we launched a new telehealth service called “Connect with a Vet,” that allows pet parents and veterinarians to leverage the company’s proprietary tele-triage platform to preserve continuous veterinarian care. With this service, Chewy makes it possible for pet parents to connect directly with a licensed veterinarian to get answers to some of the most commonly asked questions, to receive advice, discuss concerns they might have regarding the health and wellness of their pet, and even get referrals to their local vets or emergency clinics. This was followed by the launch of compounding medications in November 2020, providing pet owners the ability to order customized, pharmaceutical grade, prescription medications that meet their pets’ unique needs, that cannot be fulfilled by commercially available alternatives. 
These service offerings advance the company’s mission to be the most trusted resource for pet parents and veterinarians and our goal to make pet healthcare more affordable and accessible to pet parents. We believe that we share a common goal of pet health and wellness along with the veterinarian community, and we will continue to utilize our strengths to enhance partnerships with customers and veterinarians alike.
•Explore broader platform opportunities. We believe that there are additional pet offerings that can drive future growth and that our platform extends strong complementarities to other categories such as pet services, should we choose to do so. The strengths of our platform may enable us to sell directly to businesses in addition to consumers. Finally, although we have exclusively focused on sales in the U.S. to date, we may expand our offering internationally in the future.
Customers and Markets 
We serve customers through our website and mobile applications and focus on delivering the best products with the best service at competitive prices. We operate customer service centers 24/7 to serve our customers every single day of the year.
Competition 
The pet products and services industry is highly competitive and can be organized into the following categories: internet (including online sales by omnichannel players); pet specialty stores; mass merchandisers/discount stores/supercenters; food stores; wholesale clubs; farm/feed stores; independent pet channel; dollar stores; drug stores; natural food; and veterinary.
Competition in the pet products and services industry is strong, particularly within the e-commerce channel as the industry continues to experience a secular shift from in-store to online shopping. We face competition from the websites of our competitors such as other online retailers, online sales for omnichannel retailers, our suppliers’ own websites, and traditional brick and mortar retailers as well as those in the veterinary channel. Some of the principal competitive factors influencing our business are price, product selection and availability, fast and reliable delivery, and customer service. We believe our ability to provide a seamless shopping experience, fast and reliable delivery options, including our convenient Autoship subscription program, and our knowledgeable customer service sets us apart from our competitors.
Trademarks and Intellectual Property
Our rights in our intellectual property, including trademarks, patents, trade secrets, copyrights and domain names, as well as contractual provisions and restrictions on use of our intellectual property, are important to our business. For example, our trademark rights assist in our marketing efforts to develop brand recognition and differentiate our brands from our competitors. We own a number of trademark registrations and applications, in the U.S. as well as in certain foreign jurisdictions. These trademarks include, among others, “American Journey,” “All Kind,” “Blue Box Event,” “Chewy,” “Chewy.com,” “Dr. Lyon’s,” “Frisco,” “Goody Box,” “Onguard,” “Tiny Tiger,” “True Acre Farms,” and “Tylee’s.” The current registrations of these trademarks are effective for varying periods of time and may be renewed periodically, provided that we, as the registered owner, or our licensees where applicable, comply with all applicable renewal requirements including, where necessary, the 
continued use of the trademarks in connection with similar goods and services. We expect to pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe they would be beneficial and cost-effective.
In addition to trademark protection, we own numerous domain names, including www.chewy.com. We also enter into, and rely on, confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors and business partners to protect our trade secrets, proprietary technology and other confidential information. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in both our customer terms of use on our website and in our vendor terms and conditions.
We believe that our intellectual property has substantial value and has significantly contributed to our success to date. We continually engage with manufacturers to develop and market better quality pet products under our brand names to better serve our customers at a lower price.
Seasonality 
Seasonality in our business does not follow that of traditional retailers, such as typically high concentration of revenue in the holiday quarter. Our net sales tend to grow throughout the fiscal year as we continue to acquire additional new customers and they continue to purchase from us. We recognized 23%, 24%, 25%, and 28% of our annual net sales during the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020, respectively.
Human Capital
Our employees are critical to us fulfilling our mission of being the most trusted and convenient online destination for pet parents (and partners) everywhere. We accomplish this, in part, by recruiting, hiring, training, and retaining employees who share our core values of delivering superior customer service and caring about the needs of pets and their parents. To continue our mission, and to compete and succeed in our highly competitive and rapidly evolving market, it is crucial that we continue to attract, develop, motivate, and retain well-qualified employees. As part of these efforts, we strive to offer a competitive compensation and benefits program, focus on employee safety, give employees the opportunity to have a positive impact on society by being a part of our philanthropic endeavors, and foster a workplace that is reflective of our society and where everyone feels empowered to do their best work.
We employed approximately 18,500 full-time and part-time employees as of January 31, 2021. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. As of March 23, 2021, none of our employees were represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 
Compensation and Benefits Program. Our compensation and benefits are designed to enable us to attract, retain, and motivate well-qualified talent. We offer market-competitive compensation and benefits including life and health (medical, dental, and vision) insurance, paid time off, paid parental leave, a 401(k) plan, and a discount off purchases made on Chewy.com. We also offer our corporate employees “Paw-ternity” leave, allowing them to work from home for the first two weeks after a new dog is brought into their home. In addition, during fiscal year 2020, we offered emergency sick pay and additional paid time off for hourly employees for absences related to COVID-19.
Team Member Safety. We are committed to the health and safety of our employees. During fiscal year 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented additional safety protocols to protect our employees, including protocols regarding social distancing and face coverings, temperature checks, and enhanced cleanings. In addition, a vast majority of our corporate employees continue to work remotely. We also provide several channels for all employees to speak up, ask for guidance, and report concerns related to ethics or safety violations.
Community Involvement. Our Chewy Gives Back team works tirelessly at continuing our philanthropic mission of supporting animal shelters and rescues everywhere. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, we donated approximately $35 million in products and supplies to animal shelters and rescues. 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. At Chewy, we recognize the significance of a diverse and inclusive workforce and fostering safe working environments in which our employees can be their authentic and best selves. Chewy’s diversity, equity, and inclusion mission is to hire, retain, and promote exceptional talent that values and is inclusive of all backgrounds and perspectives to deliver excellence. We are focused on this mission and on building an inclusive culture through a variety of diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, including assessments of current Chewy processes and policies.
