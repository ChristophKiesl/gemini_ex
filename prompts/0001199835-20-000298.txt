ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Company History
 
Organization
 
Bio-Matrix Scientific Group, Inc. (Bio-Matrix) was organized on October 6, 1998 in the State of Delaware, originally under the name Tasco International, Inc, which was subsequently changed to Tasco Holdings International, Inc., and then to Bio-Matrix Scientific Group, Inc. in 2006. On May 26, 2020, Bio-Matrixs name was further changed to Rivulet Media, Inc.
2019 Reverse Merger Transaction
 
On July 31, 2019, Bio-Matrix acquired 100% of the share capital of Pine Hills, Inc., a Wyoming corporation, in exchange for the issuance of 4,080,000 common shares of Bio-Matrix, to Heather Cassady, the sole shareholder of Pine Hills, Inc. In conjunction with this transaction, all of the outstanding shares of Series AA and Series AAA Preferred Stock of Bio-Matrix were cancelled. Pine Hills was in the business of providing data storage and the archiving of corporate documents, and its operations subsequent to that date were nominal.
 
Upon completion of the transaction, Heather Cassady owned approximately 54% of the voting capital stock of Bio-Matrix.

2020 Change in Control Transaction
 
On March 26, 2020, Debbie Rasmussen and Klusman Family Holdings (together, the Buyers) and David Koos and Heather Cassady (together, the Sellers) completed a Stock Purchase Agreement (the SPA) whereby Buyers purchased from Sellers 4,364,235 shares of the outstanding common stock of Bio-Matrix. This transaction resulted in a change in control of Bio-Matrix based on the transfer of approximately 55.8% of the outstanding common shares of Bio-Matrix from Sellers to Buyers. The amount of consideration for the purchase of such common shares was $215,000 with the source of the consideration being a loan from an unaffiliated third party.
 
As a condition of closing of the SPA, each director and officer of Bio-Matrix resigned from their position effective April 6, 2020, and Mike Witherill and Aaron Klusman were appointed as directors of Bio-Matrix to take office effective April 6, 2020. Additionally, effective April 6, 2020, Mr. Klusman was appointed Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Bio-Matrix and Mr. Witherill was appointed Vice-Chairman and President of Bio-Matrix. At the closing of the transaction, Mike Witherill and Aaron Klusman, directly and indirectly, effectively controlled the equivalent of 77,896,200 shares of common stock of Bio-Matrix, representing approximately 89.6% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Bio-Matrix.
 
2020 Reverse Merger Transaction
 
On April 13, 2020, Bio-Matrix acquired 100% of the membership interests of Rivulet Films, L.L.C., which became Rivulet Films, Inc. (Rivulet Films), which was organized on February 11, 2020 in the State of Arizona, in exchange for the issuance of 79,155,765 shares of common stock of Bio-Matrix distributed on a pro rata basis to the shareholders of Rivulet Films. Rivulet Films is a development stage company involved in the arts and entertainment business.
 
On May 26, 2020, Bio-Matrixs name was changed to Rivulet Media, Inc.
 
Changes in Capital Structure of Company
 
On January 29, 2020, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation with the State of Delaware to (1) reduce the number of shares of common stock that the Company is authorized to issue from 16,000,000,000 shares to 100,000,000 shares, with no change in the $0.0001 per share par value; (2) effect a reverse stock split of the Companys issued and outstanding shares of common stock and all classes of issued and outstanding preferred stock at an exchange ratio of one new share for every 2,000 old shares, with fractional shares of stock being rounded up to the nearest whole share. All share and per share amounts presented in these financial statements and footnotes for all periods presented have been retroactively restated to reflect the 1-for-2,000 reverse stock split.
 
On May 26, 2020, the Company filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the State of Delaware to (1) change the Companys name to Rivulet Media, Inc.; (2) increase the number of shares of common stock that the Company is authorized to issue from 100,000,000 shares to 200,000,000 shares, par value $0.0001 per share, with the number of shares of preferred stock that the Company is authorized to issue remaining unchanged at 20,000,000 shares, par value $0.0001 per share; and (3) eliminate the class of Non-Voting Preferred Stock, of which 200,000 shares, par value $1.00 per share, had been authorized and none were outstanding.
 
Additional Subsidiaries
 
As of May 28, 2020, Rivulet, Maughan Music, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Rivulet (Maughan Music), and Maughan Music Group LLC, an Arizona limited liability company, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger pursuant to which Maughan Music Group LLC merged with and into Maughan Music and the separate existence of Maughan Music Group LLC ceased. This merger was consummated on June 12, 2020.

In June 2020, the Company formed Borderline Productions LLC, an Arizona limited liability company (“Borderline”), as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rivulet Films for a production related to the life of former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio. Production commenced as of July 31, 2020.
 
In June 2020, the Company formed PBP Productions LLC, an Arizona limited liability company (“PBP”), as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rivulet Films for production activities related to the film “Please Baby Please.” Production activities began during September 2020.
 
In August 2020, the Company formed Mistress Movie, LLC, an Arizona limited liability company (“Mistress Movie”), as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rivulet Films for production activities related to a feature film. As of the date of this report on Form 10-K, Mistress Movie had no operations or assets.
 
In October 2020, the Company formed Into the Black Productions LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary in the State of Arizona (“Into the Black”), as a subsidiary of Rivulet Films. As of the date of this report on Form 10-K, Into the Black had no operations or assets.
 
The Company has and will continue to form special purpose subsidiaries to produce various films and music.
 
Business Information and Strategy
 
The business of the Company is to produce, distribute and market feature-length films, television series and mini-series, and television movies, from initial creative development through principal photography, postproduction, distribution and ancillary sales.
 
The business strategy of Rivulet as it relates to films, television series, mini-series, and television movies is to enter into contracts with well-known actors and actresses, acquire scripts able to attract large audiences that have been overlooked by blockbuster producers, focus on cost control measures, obtain favorable tax credits and financing opportunities, and enter into joint ventures to allocate some of our costs for distribution to large companies either directly or through subsidiary entities. Unlike many smaller producers, Rivulet is not targeting “artsy” niche markets but films that appeal to a wide audience. The Company’s business plan as an independent film producer is to fully leverage all of its guaranteed contracts that it negotiates upfront for a film to be produced. This strategy permits the Company to raise less equity capital and obtain short term bridge loans thereby permitting much larger budgets than historically could be obtained by independent film producers. Management believes this strategy enables the Company to produce films with budgets of up to $50 million. This strategy also permits the Company to forego the risks associated with a speculative movie venture which may or may not repay its funding sources by pre-selling contracts to distributors such as Netflix who are looking for content to reach its viewers. The Company can also determine whether to sell its domestic or international rights to another production company if unanticipated cash needs develop while in production.
 
We intend to grow and diversify our portfolio of content to capitalize on demand from emerging and traditional platforms throughout the world. We will attempt to maintain a disciplined approach to acquisition, production, and distribution of product by balancing our financial risks against the probability of commercial success for each project. We pursue the same disciplined approach to investments in, and acquisition of, libraries and other assets complementary to our business. We believe that our strategic focus on content and creation of innovative content distribution strategies will enhance our competitive position in the industry, ensure optimal use of our capital, build a diversified foundation for future growth, and generate significant long-term value for our stockholders.

We are currently filming Please Baby Please in Montana under strict COVID-19 protocols approved by the Screen Actors Guild and we do not anticipate any delays at this time but there is no assurance that delays may not occur. Our project based on former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio is currently in post-production editing and is expected to be completed in early 2021, but there is no assurance that delays may not occur.
 
The Company’s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including the need for additional capital, as described below. Although the Company has commenced nominal revenue-generating operations, it does not have positive cash flows from operations and will be dependent on periodic infusions of capital to fund its operating requirements.
 
Background of Management
 
Mr. Witherill, the Company’s President, CFO, and Vice-Chairman has produced a variety of films over the past 6 years. In that process he has developed significant relations with the three top major film talent agencies: Creative Artists Agency, William Morris Endeavor, and United Talent Agency. We expect to utilize the contacts, along with compelling scripts and subject matter, to attract well-known talent. Talent used, among others, in the movies previously produced by Mr. Witherill include Ed Harris, Amy Madigan, Eva Longoria, Olivia Wilde, Jack Johnson, Anna Kendrick, Thomas Hayden Church, Terrance Howard, Ashanti Douglas and Keanu Reeves.
 
Mr. Witherill has experience in the motion picture production and music production industries, including co-producing, through a company called MJW Films, LLC (which is not owned by the Company), the popular box office motion picture entitled “John Wick,” which starred Keanu Reeves. Building on this success in producing “John Wick,” the Company believes there is a market for smaller motion picture producers.


On May 27, 2020, the Company, Rivulet Films, and Paris Film, Inc. and Rob Paris (together, “Paris”) entered into an employment agreement pursuant to which Mr. Paris will serve as President of Rivulet Films, a significant subsidiary of the Company. Mr. Paris has extensive experience in the film industry, including working as a literary agent at Creative Artists Agency where he packaged and arranged finance for many iconic projects, including Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Dawson’s Creek, Donnie Darko, One Hour Photo and The Day After Tomorrow. Subsequently, Mr. Paris developed and produced numerous successful film projects, including The Maiden Heist, Gambit, Everly, I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House, and The Last Laugh..
 
Industry Background
 
As a film, television, and music production company, we participate in a competitive and ever-changing industry. The following provides an overview of the media industry in which we engage, including discussion of the various markets, production and distribution methods, and some of the challenges that we, along with any other similar media enterprise, must navigate. While much of this information is applicable to the film, television, and music businesses generally, because those are the businesses in which we engage and compete, this information provides a necessary framework for an understanding of the more specific discussions of our business and projects that we undertake.

The Feature Film Industry
 
The feature film industry encompasses the development, production, and exhibition of feature-length motion pictures and their subsequent distribution in the home video, television, and other ancillary markets. The major studios dominate the industry, some of which have divisions that are promoted as independent distributors of motion pictures, including Universal Pictures, Warner Bros., Twentieth Century Fox, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Paramount Pictures, The Walt Disney Company, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. In recent years, however, true independent motion picture production and distribution companies have played an important role in the production of motion pictures for the worldwide feature film market.
Independent Feature Film Production and Financing
 
Generally, independent production companies do not have access to the extensive capital required to make big budget motion pictures, such as the blockbuster product produced by the major studios. They also do not have the capital necessary to maintain the substantial overhead that is typical of such studios operations. Independent producers target their product at specialized markets and usually produce motion pictures with budgets lower than those of films produced by major studios. Generally, independent producers do not maintain significant infrastructure. They instead hire only creative and other production personnel and retain the other elements required for development, preproduction, principal photography, and post-production activities on a project-by-project basis. Also, independent production companies typically finance their production activities from bank loans, pre-sales, equity offerings, co-productions, and joint ventures rather than out of operating cash flow. They generally complete financing of an independent motion picture prior to commencement of principal photography to minimize risk of loss.
Independent Feature Film Distribution
 
Motion picture distribution encompasses the exploitation of motion pictures in theatres and in markets, such as the home video, pay-per-view, pay television, free television and ancillary markets, such as hotels, airlines and streaming films on the Internet. Independent producers do not typically have distribution capabilities and rely instead on pre-sales to North American and international distributors. Generally, the local distributor will acquire distribution rights for a motion picture in one or more of the aforementioned distribution channels from an independent producer. The local distributor will agree to advance the producer a non-refundable minimum guarantee. The local distributor will then generally receive a distribution fee of between 20% and 35% of receipts, while the producer will receive a portion of gross receipts in excess of the distribution fees, distribution expenses, and monies retained by exhibitors. The local distributor and theatrical exhibitor generally will enter into an arrangement providing for the exhibitors payment to the distributor of a percentage (generally 40% to 50%) of the box-office receipts for the exhibition period, depending upon the success of the motion picture.
The Television Industry
 
The North American television industry serves the largest broadcast market in the world, with a population of more than 300 million people and more than 120 million homes. Historically, the North American market has been the source of the major portion of the revenues earned by television producers. However, the broadcasting and cable television markets outside North America have grown in recent years through the privatization of broadcasting systems, the proliferation of broadcast licenses, and the introduction of sophisticated delivery technology, such as cable and satellite transmission systems. This growth has led to a higher proportion of revenues from international markets. Generally, a production company will license the right to broadcast a program to a combination of United States, Canadian, and international broadcasters, including free television and cable networks or individual television stations in the first run syndication market. After the initial network, cable licensing, or first run syndication period, the production company will make the program available for further commercial exploitation on cable and/or in syndication.
The Music Industry
 
Recorded music is one of the primary mediums of entertainment for consumers worldwide. Over time, major recorded music companies have built significant recorded music catalogs, which are long-lived assets that are exploited year after year. The sale of catalog material is typically more profitable than that of new releases, given lower development costs and more limited marketing costs. Through the end of the third calendar quarter of 2016 (i.e., the week ending September 29, 2016), according to SoundScan, 56% of all calendar year-to-date U.S. album unit sales, excluding streaming sales, were from recordings more than 18 months old, with 48% from recordings more than three years old.
  7

 
Music Publishing
 
The Company also intends to produce and distribute musical artists and film soundtracks. Music publishing involves the acquisition of rights to, and licensing of, musical compositions (as opposed to recordings) from songwriters, composers, or other rightsholders. Music publishing revenues are derived from five main royalty sources: Mechanical, Performance, Synchronization, Digital, and Other.
 
In the U.S., mechanical royalties are collected by music publishers from recorded music companies or via The Harry Fox Agency, a non-exclusive licensing agent affiliated with performance-rights organization SESAC, while outside the U.S., collection societies generally perform this function. Once mechanical royalties reach the publisher (either directly from record companies or from collection societies), percentages of those royalties are paid or credited to the writer or other rightsholder of the copyright in accordance with the underlying rights agreement. Mechanical royalties are paid at a penny rate of 9.1 cents per song per unit in the U.S. for physical formats (e.g., CDs and vinyl albums) and permanent digital downloads (recordings in excess of five minutes attract a higher rate). There are also rates set for interactive streaming and non-permanent downloads based on a formula that takes into account revenues paid by consumers or advertisers with certain minimum royalties that may apply depending on the type of service. Controlled composition provisions contained in some recording agreements may apply to the rates mentioned above pursuant to which artist/songwriters license their rights to their record companies for as little as 75% of the statutory rates. The current U.S. statutory mechanical rates will remain in effect until the next schedule of mechanical licensing rates is determined.
 
Throughout the world, performance royalties are typically collected on behalf of publishers and songwriters by performance rights organizations and collection societies. Key performing rights organizations and collection societies include The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), SESAC and Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) in the U.S.; Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society and The Performing Right Society (MCPS/PRS) in the U.K.; The German Copyright Society in Germany (GEMA); and the Japanese Society for Rights of Authors, Composers and Publishers in Japan (JASRAC). The societies pay a percentage (which is set in each country) of the performance royalties to the copyright owner(s) or administrators (i.e., the publisher(s)), and a percentage directly to the songwriter(s), of the composition. Thus, the publisher generally retains the performance royalties it receives other than any amounts attributable to co-publishers.
 
The music publishing market has proven to be more resilient than the recorded music market in recent years as revenue streams other than mechanical royalties are largely unaffected by piracy, and are benefiting from additional sources of income from digital exploitation of music in streaming and downloads.
 
Production and Distribution Methods
 
Theatrical Production
 
Theatrical production consists of greenlighting (proceeding with production) and financing motion pictures, as well as the development of screenplays, filming activities, and the post-filming editing/post-production process. We plan to take a disciplined approach to theatrical production with the goal of producing content that can be distributed through various domestic and international platforms. We may attempt to mitigate the financial risk associated with production by negotiating co-financing development and co-production agreements (which provide for joint efforts and cost-sharing between us and one or more third-party companies) and preselling international distribution rights on a selective basis, including through international output agreements (which refers to licensing the rights to distribute a film in one or more media generally for a limited term, in one or more specific territories prior to completion of the film). We also may attempt to minimize production exposure by structuring agreements with talent that provide for them to participate in the financial success of the motion picture in exchange for reducing guaranteed amounts to be paid, regardless of the films success (referred to as up-front payments). In addition, many states and foreign countries have implemented incentive programs designed to attract film production as a means of economic development. Government incentives typically take the form of sales tax refunds, transferable tax credits, refundable tax credits, low interest loans, direct subsidies, or cash rebates, which are generally calculated based on the amount of money spent in the particular jurisdiction in connection with the production. Each jurisdiction determines the regulations that must be complied with, as well as the conditions that must be satisfied, in order for a production to qualify for the incentive. We intend to use such incentives and/or programs and other structures to further reduce our financial risk in theatrical production.
  8

 
We may also acquire the rights to films for theatrical release, instead of producing the films ourselves. Our approach to acquiring films for theatrical release will be similar to our approach to film production. We will generally seek to limit our financial exposure in acquiring films while adding films of quality and commercial viability to our release schedule and library.
 
Theatrical Distribution
 
In general, the economic life of a motion picture consists of its exploitation in theaters, on packaged media, and on various digital and television platforms in territories around the world. Theatrical distribution refers to the marketing and commercial or retail exploitation of motion pictures. Although historically our model has been to distribute motion pictures directly to U.S. movie theaters, with the COVID-19 pandemic shutting down theaters we are now focused on distribution to streaming services such as Netflix, among others. Generally, distributors and exhibitors (theater owners) will enter into agreements whereby the exhibitor retains a portion of the gross box office receipts, which are the admissions paid at the box office. The balance is remitted to the distributor. Successful motion pictures may continue to play in theaters for more than three months following their initial release. We may also sell or license rights in all media on a territory by territory basis for release in foreign markets. Concurrent with their release in the U.S., motion pictures are generally released in Canada and may also be released in one or more other foreign markets. After the initial theatrical release, distributors seek to maximize revenues by releasing movies in sequential release date windows, which may be exclusive against other non-theatrical distribution channels. In most territories, international theatrical distribution (outside of the U.S. and Canada) generally follows the same cycle as domestic theatrical distribution. Historically, the international distribution cycle would begin a few months after the start of the domestic distribution cycle. However, due, in part, to international box office growth, as well as film piracy in international markets, a much higher percentage of films are being released simultaneously in the U.S. and international markets, or even earlier in certain international markets.
 
Producing, marketing, and distributing a motion picture can involve significant risks and costs, and can cause our financial results to vary depending on the timing of a motion pictures release. For example, marketing costs are generally incurred before and throughout the theatrical release of a film and, to a lesser extent, other distribution windows, and are expensed as incurred. Therefore, we may incur losses with respect to a particular film prior to and during the films theatrical exhibition, and profitability for the film may not be realized until after its theatrical release window. Additionally, there can be no assurance that any of the motion pictures scheduled for release will be completed, that completion will occur in accordance with the anticipated schedule or budget, or that the film will ever be released.
 
The Companys business will normally be subject to seasonal variations based on the timing of theatrical motion picture and home entertainment releases. Release dates are determined by several factors, including timing of vacation and holiday periods and competition in the market, but the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the historical model and caused an indefinite delay in many release dates. Also, revenues in the Companys consumer products business will be influenced by both seasonal consumer purchasing behavior and the timing of theatrical releases and generally peak in the fiscal quarter of a films theatrical release.
 
Packaged Media
 
Packaged media distribution involves the marketing, promotion, and sale and/or lease of DVDs and Blu-ray discs to wholesalers and retailers who then sell or rent the DVDs and Blu-ray discs to consumers for private viewing. For new theatrical titles, home entertainment distribution has traditionally occurred within three to four months of initial theatrical release. However, due in part to new methods of distribution and the rise of new digital platforms and networks, select titles are now being released on video-on-demand (VOD) and other digital formats on the same day as the title is theatrically released (a so called day & date release strategy). These titles typically release on a modest number of screens for the purpose of positioning VOD and other ancillary platforms. We may also experiment with various other windowing strategies, where, for instance, a title may be released theatrically on several hundred screens, followed by an electronic-sell-through, and premium priced interactive VOD window, followed by release on packaged media, regular priced cable VOD, and later, subscription video-on-demand (SVOD). These release strategies are not applicable to every film, and may change based on release patterns, new technologies and product flow.
  9

 
We intend to distribute or sell content directly to retailers such as Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Target, Costco, and others who buy large volumes of our DVDs and Blu-ray discs to sell directly to consumers. We also intend to directly distribute content to the rental market through Netflix, Amazon, Redbox, and similar providers.
 
Digital Media
 
Digital media distribution involves delivering content (including certain titles not available on packaged media) by electronic means directly to consumers through in-home devices (such as set-top boxes from cable, satellite and telco companies, connected or smart devices, game consoles, and HDMI dongles) and mobile devices (such as smart phones, tablets, and personal computers). The key distribution methods today, of which we intend to be an active participant, include transactional distribution (such as pay-per-view, electronic-sell-through, transaction video-on-demand, non-transactional distribution (such as SVOD), advertiser-supported VOD, and free VOD) and distribution through various linear pay, basic cable and free television platforms.
Television Production
 
We intend to enter the television business through the development, production, syndication and distribution of television programming. We intend to generate revenue from the licensing and distribution of such programming to broadcast television networks, pay and basic cable networks, digital platforms and syndicators of first-run programming, which license programs on a station-by-station basis, and pay in cash or via barter (i.e., trade of programming for airtime).
 
Each of these platforms may acquire a mix of original and library programming. After initial exhibition, we intend to distribute programming to subsequent buyers, both domestically and internationally, including basic cable network, premium subscription services, or digital platforms (known as off-network syndicated programming).
 
Off-network syndicated programming can be sold in successive cycles of sales which may occur on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis. In addition, television programming is sold on home video (packaged media and via digital delivery) and across all other applicable ancillary revenue streams including music publishing, touring and integration. As with film production, we intend to use tax credits, subsidies, and other incentive programs for television production in order to maximize our returns and ensure fiscally responsible production models.
 
Music Distribution
 
In 2015, mass-market retailers accounted for 15% of total industry unit sales calculated on a total album plus digital track equivalent (ten tracks per album) unit basis in the U.S., according to SoundScan data. Online sales of physical product as well as digital downloads have grown to represent an increasing share of U.S. unit sales and combined they accounted for 71% of total industry unit sales in calendar year 2015. However, in more recent years, there has been a major shift in distribution of recorded music from physical media to online and streaming distribution, such as through Spotify, which has approximately 144 million subscribers. Streaming revenue rose to $11.4 billion last year from $9.2 billion in 2018, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, accounting for more than half of global recorded-music revenue for the first time, and recorded-music revenue topped $20 billion in 2019 for the first time since 2004.
Competitive Business Conditions and Competitive Position in the Industry
 
Television and motion picture production and distribution are highly competitive businesses. We face competition from companies within the entertainment business and from alternative forms of leisure entertainment, such as travel, sporting events, outdoor recreation and other cultural activities. We compete with the major studios, numerous independent motion picture and television production companies, television networks, and pay television systems for the acquisition of literary and film properties, the services of performing artists, directors, producers, and other creative and technical personnel and production financing. In addition, our motion pictures compete for audience acceptance and exhibition outlets with motion pictures produced and distributed by other companies. As a result, the success of any of our motion pictures is dependent not only on the quality and acceptance of a particular picture, but also on the quality and acceptance of other competing motion pictures released into the marketplace at or near the same time.
  10

 
Given such competition, we will attempt to operate with a different business model than many others. We will emphasize a lower cost structure, risk mitigation, reliance on financial partnerships and innovative financial strategies. Our cost structures will be designed to utilize our flexibility and agility as well as the entrepreneurial spirit of our employees, partners, and affiliates, in order to provide creative entertainment content to serve diverse audiences worldwide.
 
The success of our businesses depends on our ability to license and produce content for our programming networks that is adequate in quantity and quality and will generate satisfactory viewer ratings. In each of these cases, some of our competitors are large publicly held companies that have greater financial resources than we do. In addition, we compete with these entities for advertising revenue. It is difficult to predict the future effect of technology on many of the factors affecting our competitive position.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We intend to create, own, and distribute intellectual property worldwide. Our practice will entail protecting our motion pictures, programs, content, brands, characters, games, publications, and other original and acquired works, and ancillary goods and services. We are fundamentally a content company, and the protection of our brands and entertainment content, and the laws affecting our intellectual property, are of paramount importance to us. We may license our film, television, and music intellectual property for various other ancillary products, such as video games, theatrical stage productions, and clothing.
 
We do not currently have any registered intellectual property. We believe that ownership of such copyrights, domain names, and similar intellectual property is an important factor in our business and that our success does depends, in part, on such ownership.
 
In the United States, under current law, the copyright term for authored works is the life of the author plus 70 years. For works-made-for-hire, the copyright term is the shorter of 95 years from first publication or 120 years from creation.
 
We intend to achieve worldwide distribution of our film projects, including distribution in Europe, South America, and Asia, by entering into licensing and distribution arrangements with reputable movie distributors. Piracy, including in the digital environment, is extensive in many parts of the world, including South America, Asia, and certain Eastern European countries, and is made easier by technological advances and the conversion of content into digital formats. This trend facilitates the creation, transmission, and sharing of high quality unauthorized copies of content on packaged media and through digital formats. The proliferation of unauthorized copies of these products will likely have an adverse effect on our business, because these products reduce the revenue we receive from our products. To protect our intellectual property assets, we will rely on a combination of copyright, unfair competition, and other laws and contract provisions. However, there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case.
 
Third parties may challenge the validity or scope of the Companys intellectual property from time to time, and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. Irrespective of their validity, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an adverse effect on the Companys operations. Moreover, effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories. Therefore, the Company will engage in efforts to strengthen and update intellectual property protection around the world, including efforts to ensure the effective enforcement of intellectual property laws and remedies for infringement. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.
  11

 
Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations
 
Our business is subject to and affected by laws and regulations of U.S. federal, state, and local governmental authorities. These laws and regulations are constantly subject to change. The Company does not, however, engage in any activities that cause it to be subject it to any specific laws or regulations other than those that are generally applicable to all businesses.
Internet and Other Media Operator Regulations
 
The adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business. For example, recent changes to European law may cause some individual member states to attempt to impose levies and other financial obligations on media operators located outside their jurisdiction. We anticipate that several jurisdictions may, over time, attempt to impose additional financial and regulatory obligations on us. In addition, the continued growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws, which may impose additional burdens on us. If we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation, this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model.
 
Changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet, including laws impacting net neutrality, could decrease the demand for our service and increase our cost of doing business. Given uncertainty around these rules, including changing interpretations, amendments or repeal, coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators, we could experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business.
 
Number of Total and Full Time Employees
 
As of the date of this report on Form 10-K, the Company employed seven people. We will also hire additional employees on a picture-by-picture basis in connection with the production of our motion pictures and television programming. We believe that our employee and labor relations are good. None of our full-time employees are members of unions.
 
Many film and television productions employ members of a number of unions, including the International Alliance of Theatrical and Stage Employees and Teamsters. If we were to employ union members, a strike by one or more of the unions that provide personnel essential to the production of motion pictures or television programs could delay or halt our ongoing production activities. Such a halt or delay, depending on the length of time involved, could cause delay or interruption in our release of new motion pictures and television programs and thereby could adversely affect our cash flow and revenues.
