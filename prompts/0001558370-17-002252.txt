 Item 1. Business.
 Overview
 We are the leading provider of magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) products. Our MRAM products offer the persistence of non-volatile memory, a type of memory that retains information even in the absence of power, with the speed and endurance of random access memory (RAM), and enable the protection of mission critical data particularly in the event of power interruption or failure. Our MRAM products allow our customers in the industrial, automotive and transportation, and enterprise storage markets to design high performance, power efficient and reliable systems without the need for bulky batteries or capacitors. We are the only provider of commercially available MRAM solutions, and over the past eight years we have shipped over 60 million MRAM units.
 Our MRAM technology, unlike traditional semiconductor memory technologies, stores data as a magnetic state rather than an electrical charge, and is offered as either a discrete or embedded solution. Our products read and write data at speeds on par with most dynamic RAM (DRAM) and static RAM (SRAM). Our products offer the non-volatility of flash memory but with significantly superior endurance. We offer our MRAM products with different densities and interfaces to address the various needs of our customers. Our lower-density MRAM products, which we define as having bit densities from 128kb to 16Mb, offer write-speeds on par with SRAM, with virtually unlimited endurance. Our higher density products, which we define as having bit densities at or greater than 64Mb, offer write-speeds on par with DRAM and have superior endurance compared to most other non-volatile memory technologies.
 Our lower-density products are optimized for use in industrial, and automotive and transportation applications, while our higher-density products are optimized for use in enterprise storage applications. In the enterprise storage market, we collaborate with industry-leading memory controller companies to enable compatibility of their controllers with our MRAM products, facilitating the adoption of our solutions into our customers’ existing end products. We have over 600 customers worldwide, including Honeywell, ifm, Nikkiso and Siemens in the industrial market, Airbus and Hyundai Mobis in the automotive and transportation market, and Broadcom, Dell, IBM and Lenovo in the enterprise storage market. We sell our products directly and through our established distribution channel to industry-leading original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and original design manufacturers (ODMs)
 We leverage both internal and outsourced manufacturing capabilities to produce our MRAM products. We purchase industry-standard complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) wafers from semiconductor foundries and complete the processing of our products by inserting our magnetic-bit technology at our 200mm fabrication facility in Chandler, Arizona. We have entered into a manufacturing agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES for 300mm high-volume production of our higher-density products. We believe our strategic relationship with GLOBALFOUNDRIES accelerates the development of our MRAM solutions, provides us with leading-edge outsourced manufacturing capabilities, and enables us to operate a variable cost financial model. In addition, GLOBALFOUNDRIES has the ability to embed our technology in its products for sale to its customers, from which we would earn licensing or royalty revenue.
 For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 we recorded revenue of $27.1 million, $26.5 million, $24.9 million, gross margin of 54.3%, 52.7%, and 52.6%, and a net loss of $16.7 million, $18.2 million, and $10.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had 90 employees, more than half of whom are engaged in research and development. Our headquarters are located in Chandler, Arizona. Our principal design center is in Austin, Texas, and we have additional sales operations in the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific regions.

 The Opportunity for Fast, Persistent MemoryMRAM
 Traditional memory technologies have either fast write-speeds or are non-volatile, but not both. MRAM combines both features into a single solution, making it an ideal memory to protect data in the event of power interruption or failure, and to store data that is frequently written and accessed. We believe customers that employ MRAM in their systems are better able to design higher performance, lower power, more reliable and simpler systems than they would be able to design using other existing memory technologies. The following attributes make MRAM an increasingly important application specific memory solution for system architectures that require non-volatile memory with the speed and endurance of RAM:
 Non-volatile. MRAM can retain data in the event of power interruption or failure, which enables end-system designers to create products without costly power-loss protection systems, such as batteries and capacitors.
 Fast Write- Speeds. MRAM offers write-speeds that are on par with the fastest available volatile memory technologies, including most DRAM and SRAM and is significantly faster than other non-volatile memories used today. For example, MRAM writes a block over 100,000 times faster than NAND flash, a type of non-volatile flash memory.
 Superior Write- Cycle Endurance. MRAM offers superior write-cycle endurance to existing non-volatile solutions, enabling end-systems designers to offer products that are not limited by memory wear-out. For example, MRAM write-cycle endurance is nearly 10 million times greater than NAND flash.
 Scalable to Greater Densities and Smaller Process Geometries. MRAM’s write-speed and endurance are scalable with increasing bit densities and smaller geometries, which we believe will allow system designers to employ MRAM in applications that require more memory and smaller form factors.
 Proven to be Manufacturable at High Volumes. MRAM can be manufactured in high volumes and in advanced nodes, and is compatible with standard CMOS.
 Low Energy Requirement. MRAM utilizes energy efficiently over the duration of its write and read cycles. It has the ability to be completely powered down, consuming no energy while still retaining data, which data can be accessed quickly once power is restored.
 These attributes enable MRAM to be used as a true Storage Class Memory, by which we mean a form of memory that has non-volatility that is similar to storage but with performance that is similar to DRAM or SRAM. MRAM has already proven its commercial viability as a discrete and embedded solution in application-specific memory markets and we believe it will become a mainstream memory technology in the future.
 Discrete MRAM Market Opportunity
 We estimate the market opportunity for application specific MRAM products to be approximately $1.8 billion by 2018, growing approximately at a 19% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from approximately $1 billion in 2015. We expect the introduction of increasingly higher density MRAM solutions will result in greater adoption of MRAM technology into a wider range of applications and end markets.
 We expect our first generation MRAM solutions, which have lower bit densities ranging from 128kb to 16Mb, to continue to serve customers in the industrial, automotive and transportation end markets, where products tend to have long product life cycles. As MRAM bit densities increase, we believe MRAM solutions will be well-suited to address a wider range of large and growing markets, such as server and storage, increasing the overall market opportunity for MRAM. We believe our second and third generation MRAM solutions, which are designed to have bit densities at or greater than 64Mb, will drive the rapid adoption of our products into enterprise storage applications. We believe the introduction of MRAM solutions with bit densities greater than 1Gb will extend the opportunity for MRAM into additional adjacent markets such as server and mobile computing.

 Embedded MRAM Technology
 In addition to use as a discrete product, MRAM can serve as embedded memory in a variety of CMOS technologies. Memory accounts for a significant portion of the area of System-on-a-Chips (SoCs), application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), application-specific standard products, microcontrollers, baseband processors, storage controllers, application processors and field-programmable gate arrays. Memory that is integrated in these products is called embedded memory and offers similar performance to its discrete counterparts.
 Today’s embedded memory solutions include embedded SRAM (eSRAM), embedded Flash (eFlash), and embedded DRAM (eDRAM). We believe these technologies have difficulties scaling to advanced CMOS processing nodes. Embedded MRAM’s (eMRAM) compatibility with CMOS processes, combined with its lower leakage, byte addressability and high write-cycle endurance make it well-suited as a replacement for eSRAM, eFlash and eDRAM. We believe the use of eMRAM will be more cost effective for foundries by maintaining compatibility with standard CMOS, thus improving manufacturing efficiency.
 eSRAM, which uses six transistors (6‑T) to construct a memory bit, requires more silicon area and additional power due to leakage current from its multiple-transistor architecture. Embedded MRAM, which uses a single transistor architecture, results in less leakage current and requires a smaller area on an integrated circuit to achieve equivalent or better performance than eSRAM.
 eFlash requires relatively high voltage and area overhead to program the memory bits, which is contrary to the trend of scaling down the CMOS process for lower power and less chip area. eFlash also has a limited number of write cycles, which can render it ineffective as working memory on the chip. Compared to eFlash,
 eMRAM requires lower voltage to program bits, which results in greater power efficiency and it has higher write-cycle endurance. eMRAM is byte-addressable and has symmetric read and write timing, which makes it suitable as working memory. eFlash must be erased and programmed in pages, which is less efficient for intensive writing applications.
 eDRAM is a volatile memory that does not retain data when power is off. eDRAM manufacturing requires additional process steps and costs to build a capacitor to store the data. This manufacturing process could diminish the functionality of the memory or logic components in the integrated circuit. eMRAM, however, can be added towards the end of the manufacturing process, which does not impact the overall performance of the integrated circuit.

 The versatility of eMRAM can simplify the design and architecture of the overall integrated circuit by providing the ability to have one memory type serve as both working memory and code storage memory.
 Our Solutions
 We are the only commercial provider of MRAM products. We have a strong track record of innovation in MRAM technology, as demonstrated by our successive introduction of MRAM products that address an increasingly broad spectrum of applications. Our three generations of MRAM discrete solutions are set forth in the following table. First Generation
 Our first generation products, which we have been shipping since 2008, are primarily designed to address applications in the industrial, automotive and transportation markets. Our customers in these markets require memory technology that is non-volatile, writes continuously at high speeds to limit data loss, operates in harsh environments, and maintains endurance over long product lifecycles. To address these requirements, we designed our first generation of MRAM products to offer the persistence of non-volatile memory, speeds comparable to SRAM, reliability across a wide temperature range, and virtually unlimited write-cycles. We have designed our first generation products to be compatible with industry standard interfaces, including standard SRAM, SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) and QSPI (Quad SPI) interfaces, enabling our customers to replace incumbent memory solutions with our first generation MRAM solutions. We believe this has been important for the initial success and early adoption of our first generation products. Second Generation
 Our second generation products, which began shipping in 2014, are principally designed to address the requirements of the enterprise storage market, which includes high performance Solid-State Drives (SSDs), Redundant array of independent disks (RAID) systems and servers. Our customers require low latency, protection of data against power interruption and failure, high density and reliability. Our second generation products offer performance comparable to DRAM, and are up to five orders of magnitude faster than flash block writes, non-volatile to protect against power loss, four times the density of our largest first generation product, and offer endurance superior to flash. We have designed our second generation products to be compatible with industry standard DDR3 interfaces, enabling our customers to realize the benefits of higher performance and power efficiency as compared to traditional memory products requiring batteries or super capacitors. Third Generation
 Our third generation products, which are currently in development, are initially targeted for enterprise-class storage and server applications. We use our Perpendicular Magnetic Tunnel Junction (PMTJ) technology to deliver further bit density and power efficiency increases to create a true Storage Class Memory solution. Our third generation products are designed to be compatible with standard DDR3, DDR4, SPI, and QSPI interfaces, which we believe will facilitate market adoption of our products in the enterprise storage and server markets.

 Embedded MRAM
 We offer embedded MRAM (eMRAM) to our customers for integration in their SoC solutions. We also enable GLOBALFOUNDRIES to offer eMRAM in the solutions they manufacture for their customers. Our embedded memory solutions offer high performance, low cost and low power and can be manufactured using standard CMOS. eMRAM offers significant advantages over existing embedded memory solutions, particularly in endurance, bandwidth, energy and area requirements, leakage and persistence. We believe our eMRAM solutions offer the performance benefits and process compatibility to become the embedded memory of choice for our current and future foundry partners.
 Sensors
 We have developed and are currently shipping a high performance, high-reliability magnetic sensor, which is based on our Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) technology, which is at the core of our memory technology. Our magnetic sensor offers three-axis orientation in a single die, and is integrated into consumer electronics applications as an electronic compass. We believe our magnetic sensor technology can be used for additional power management applications in the industrial, and automotive and transportation, end markets. We currently license our magnetic sensor technology to third parties for their commercial use and plan to continue this strategy. Aerospace
 Aerospace and satellite electronic systems require memory that is able to withstand exposure to the levels of radiation encountered in avionics and space applications. MRAM is not susceptible to radiation induced errors because data is stored as a magnetic state rather than as an electrical charge. Aerospace and satellite equipment manufacturers license our technology for use in their electronic systems. Through license agreements, we provide manufacturing service and technology access to certain of our customers, and we sell products to value added subcontractors. Our Technology
 Memory Architecture
 Our MRAM solutions are based on our MTJ technology, which writes data by establishing a stable magnetic state, and reads data by measuring the resistance of the MTJ. MTJ devices are multilayered structures, including thin metal and dielectric layers, which are fabricated with methods commonly used in semiconductor manufacturing. The resistance is determined by the orientation of the magnetic field in the free layer relative to the fixed layer. First Generation MRAM Technology
 Our first generation MRAM technology uses a magnetic field to program, or write, bits. A significant advantage of this “field switching” is virtually unlimited write endurance, as reversing the free-layer magnetization with a magnetic field does not have any wear-out mechanism. Field Switched MRAM products are currently in production at the 180nm and 130nm nodes.

 Field Switched MRAM bit cell. Each bit cell comprises an MTJ connected in series with a select transistor.
 Second and Third Generation MRAM Technology
 Our second and third generations of MRAM technologies use the spin-torque transfer property, which is the manipulation of the spin of electrons with a polarizing current, to establish the desired magnetic state of the free layer to program, or write, the bits in the memory array. Spin-torque MRAM, or ST-MRAM, provides a significant reduction in 

 
  8

 
switching energy compared to Field-switched MRAM, and is highly scalable, enabling higher density memory products. Our second generation MRAM technology uses an In-Plane MTJ structure, while our third generation uses a Perpendicular MTJ. We have developed materials and Perpendicular MTJ stack designs with high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, which provides long data retention, small cell size, greater density, high endurance and low power.

 Embedded MRAM Technology
 MRAM technology is more easily embedded than most other memory technologies, due to the way the MRAM module is integrated in standard CMOS. Since the MRAM module is inserted between metal layers in the back-end-of-line part of the fabrication process, above the transistor layers, it does not disturb the CMOS fabrication process. Integrating MRAM in standard CMOS for SoC applications does not impact the performance of the integrated circuit. Customers
 Our MRAM products are used by industry-leading customers in the industrial, automotive and transportation, and enterprise storage markets. Representative customers using our discrete products in these end markets include:
Industrial | Automotive and Transportation | Enterprise Storage
-----------+-------------------------------+-------------------
Honeywell | Airbus | Broadcom 
ifm | Hyundai Mobis | Dell 
Nikkiso | | IBM 
Siemens | | Lenovo 

      We sell our products through our direct sales force and through a network of distributors and contract manufacturers. Direct, distributor and contract manufacturer customers purchase our solutions on an individual purchase order basis, rather than pursuant to long-term agreements.
 We consider our customer to be the end customer purchasing either directly from a distributor, a contract manufacturer or us. An end customer purchasing through a contract manufacturer typically instructs the contract manufacturer to obtain our products and to incorporate our products with other components for sale by the contract manufacturer to the end customer. Although we actually sell the products to, and are paid by, the distributors and contract manufacturers, we refer to the end customer as our customer.
 During the year ended December 31, 2016, more than 600 end customers purchased our products. No end customers accounted for more than 10% of our revenue during 2016. Sales to NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NXP) and Avago Technologies Ltd. (Broadcom) whether directly by us or through distributors or contract manufacturers, each accounted for 13% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. No other end customers accounted for more than 10% of our revenue during 2015. Sales to NXP and Dell accounted for 12% and 10%, respectively, of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. NXP is a customer for our embedded and sensor solutions. Broadcom and Dell are customers for our Gen 1 MRAM products.

 Sales and Marketing
 We sell our products through a direct sales channel and a network of representatives and distributors. The majority of our customers, and their associated contract manufacturers, buy our products through our distributors. We maintain sales, supply chain and logistics operations and have distributors in Asia to service the production needs of contract manufacturers such as us Flextronics, Foxconn, Inventec and Sanmina. We also maintain direct selling relationships with several strategic customers. Our direct sales representatives are located in North America, the United Kingdom, Germany, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.
 Our typical sales cycle consists of a sales and development process in which our field engineers and sales personnel work closely with our customers’ design engineers. This process can take from three to 12 months to complete, and a successful sales cycle culminates in a design win. Once we establish a relationship with a customer, we continue a sales process to maintain our position and to secure subsequent new design wins at the customer. Each customer lead, whether new or existing, is tracked through our CRM tool and followed in stages of prospect, design in, design win and production. This tracking results in a design win pipeline that provides a measure of the future business potential of the opportunities.
 Our technical support personnel have expertise in hardware and software, and have access to our development team to ensure proper service and support for our OEM customers. Our field application and engineering team provides technical training and design support to our customers.
 Manufacturing
 We rely on third-party suppliers for most phases of the manufacturing process, including initial fabrication and assembly.
 Wafer Manufacturing
 We manufacture our first generation and second generation MRAM discrete products, and provide foundry services for embedded MRAM, licensed MRAM products and MTJ-based sensors in our 200mm manufacturing facility. Our facility is in an ISO‑4 clean room and is qualified for the production of automotive grade products. We actively manage inventory, including automated process flows, process controls and recipe management, and we use standard equipment to manufacture our products.
 For our second generation products, GLOBALFOUNDRIES will manufacture our 256Mb in-plane MTJ discrete memory on 40nm CMOS on 300mm wafers. Our third generation of ST-MRAM, based on perpendicular MTJ, is in development in our 200mm fabrication facility and at GLOBALFOUNDRIES. Volume production of our third generation of ST-MRAM products is planned to be at more advanced process nodes at GLOBALFOUNDRIES on 300mm wafers.
 Assembly and Test
 We have designed test protocols to maximize yields at assembly and final test, reduce manufacturing costs and improve quality. Our design and product engineering teams have developed and implemented wafer-level test programs to characterize the behavior of our MRAM devices. We create predictive models and test each of our parts to assure the reliability of the products in the field. We also add unique electronic part identification numbers to provide material traceability.
 To protect the MRAM devices from stray magnetic fields, we developed packaging solutions, which we have qualified at independent, industry-leading sub-contractors, including Amkor, ASE and UTAC. We have successfully qualified our MRAM devices in various packages at temperatures ranging from commercial to automotive grade. As part of our commitment to quality, our quality management system has been certified to ISO 9001:2000 standards. Our foundry vendors and sub-contractors are also ISO 9001 certified.

 ST-MRAM Joint Development Agreement
 On October 17, 2014, we entered into a joint development agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc., a semiconductor foundry, for the joint development of our ST-MRAM technology. The term of the agreement is the later of four years from the effective date or until the completion, termination, or expiration of the last statement of work entered into pursuant to the joint development agreement.
 The joint development agreement also states that the specific terms and conditions for the production and supply of the developed MRAM technology would be pursuant to a separate manufacturing agreement entered into between the parties. See “—ST-MRAM Manufacturing Agreement” below.
 Under the joint development agreement, each party granted licenses to its relevant intellectual property to the other party. For certain jointly developed works, the parties have agreed to follow an invention allocation procedure to determine ownership. In addition, GLOBALFOUNDRIES possesses the exclusive right to manufacture our discrete and embedded spin torque MRAM devices developed pursuant to the agreement until the earlier of three years after the qualification of the MRAM device for a particular technology node or four years after the completion of the relevant statement of work under which the device was developed. For the same exclusivity period associated with the relevant device, GLOBALFOUNDRIES agreed not to license intellectual property developed in connection with the agreement to named competitors of ours.
 Generally, unless otherwise specified in the agreement or a statement of work, we and GLOBALFOUNDRIES share defined project costs equally under the joint development agreement. If GLOBALFOUNDRIES manufactures, sells or transfers wafers containing production qualified MRAM devices that utilized certain Everspin design information to its customers, GLOBALFOUNDRIES will pay royalties to us for each such wafer transferred or sold to a customer.
 Except for breaches of confidentiality provisions and each party’s indemnification obligations to one another under the agreement, liability under the agreement is capped at a range depending on project costs and royalty amounts. Either party may terminate the agreement if the other party materially breaches a term of the agreement, and fails to remedy the breach after receiving notice from the non-breaching party. If a party terminates the manufacturing agreement for material breach in accordance with its terms, that party may also terminate the joint development agreement.
 On May 27, 2016, we entered into an amendment to the joint development agreement to modify the payment schedule and to clarify our payment obligations for certain past project costs. Under the amendment, GLOBALFOUNDRIES may terminate the joint development agreement with us if we materially breach a term of the agreement, such as, but not limited to, by our failing to pay any undisputed sum which has been outstanding for 45 or more days from the date of invoice, and fail to remedy the breach within 60 days after receiving notice from GLOBALFOUNDRIES. See “Risk Factors” for further discussion of our agreements with GLOBALFOUNDRIES.
 ST-MRAM Manufacturing Agreement
 On October 23, 2014, we entered into a manufacturing agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES Singapore Pte. Ltd. that sets forth the specific terms and conditions for the production and supply of wafers manufactured using our spin torque MRAM technology developed under the joint development agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES. Pursuant to that joint development agreement, GLOBALFOUNDRIES possesses certain exclusive rights to manufacture such wafers for our discrete and embedded spin torque MRAM devices. Our manufacturing agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES includes a customary forecast and ordering mechanism for the supply of certain of our wafers, and we are obligated to order and pay for, and GLOBALFOUNDRIES is obligated to supply, wafers consistent with the binding portion of our forecast. GLOBALFOUNDRIES also has the ability to discontinue its manufacture of any of our wafers upon due notice and completion of the notice period. The initial term of the manufacturing agreement is for three years, which automatically renews for successive one year periods thereafter unless either party provides sufficient advance notice of non-renewal.
 Except for breaches of confidentiality provisions and each party’s indemnification obligations to one another under the agreement, liability under the agreement is capped at the lesser of a set amount or the total purchase price received by GLOBALFOUNDRIES from us in the twelve months immediately preceding the claim for the specific product that caused the damages. Either party may terminate the agreement if the other party materially breaches a term of the 

 
  11

 
agreement, and fails to remedy the breach after receiving notice from the non-breaching party. GLOBALFOUNDRIES may terminate the agreement if we fail to pay any undisputed sum which has been outstanding for sixty or more days from the date of invoice.
 Backlog
 As of December 31, 2016, our backlog was $7.4 million and includes all purchase orders scheduled for delivery within the subsequent 12 months. Our business and, to a large extent, that of the entire semiconductor industry, is characterized by short-term orders and shipment schedules. Orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules, or to cancellation at the customer's option without significant penalty. Thus, while backlog is useful for scheduling production, backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable measure of sales for any future period. Competition
 Our products, all of which offer the persistence of non-volatile memory with the speed and endurance of random access memory, enable the protection of mission critical data particularly in the event of power interruption or failure. Our solutions are designed for use in applications in the industrial, automotive and transportation, and enterprise storage markets where the combination of high write-cycle endurance and fast write-speeds are of critical importance.
 Our principal competitors to our first generation Field Switched MRAM products, which are tailored primarily for the industrial, automotive and transportation, and enterprise storage markets, include companies that offer nonvolatile SRAM (NVSRAM), SRAM, and ferroelectric RAM (FRAM) products, such as Cypress, Fujitsu, Integrated Silicon Solution (ISSI), Macronix, Microchip, Micron, Renesas, Samsung and Toshiba. Our second and third generation STMRAM products are designed primarily for the enterprise storage market, which includes high performance SSDs, RAID systems and servers. Our second and third generation ST-MRAM products are intended to replace DRAM-based solutions, which comprised DRAM and additional back-up power supply components, such as super capacitors and batteries that are required to make DRAM persistent. Customers typically purchase DRAM and super capacitors and batteries from separate vendors, and pair them together in order to create a DRAM-based solution capable of protecting data against power interruption or loss. Companies that offer DRAM devices include Hynix, Micron, Samsung, and several other smaller companies. In the future we may also face competition from companies developing MRAM technologies, such as Avalanche, Spin Transfer Technologies, Samsung and other larger and smaller semiconductor companies.
 Our sensor products compete with giant magnetoresistive (GMR), anisotropic magnetoresistive (AMR) and Hall effect sensors supplied by Alps, Asahi Kasei Microdevices, Crocus, Fairchild, Invensys (now Schneider), Kionix and Micronix.
 Our ability to compete successfully in the market for our products is based on a number of factors, including:

· | our product attributes and specifications;
--+-------------------------------------------


· | successful customer engagements from throughout the product life cycle;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | high quality and reliability as measured by our customers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


· | the ease of implementation of our products by customers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


· | preferred supplier status at numerous customers and ODMs
--+---------------------------------------------------------


· | manufacturing expertise and strength;
--+--------------------------------------


· | reputation and strength of customer relationships;
--+---------------------------------------------------


· | competitive pricing in the market against the competition while maintaining our gross margin profile;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  and

· | our success in meeting the needs of future customer requirements through continued development of new products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  12

 

 We believe we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors.
 Intellectual Property
 Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our products and technologies from unauthorized third-party copying and use. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as customary contractual protections. As of December 31, 2016, we held 341 issued patents that expire at various times between December 31, 2016 and September 2034, and had 157 patent applications pending. Included in our issued patents and pending applications are patents/applications in the United States, China, Europe, France, Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Italy, Singapore, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom.
 We seek to file for patents that have broad application in the semiconductor industry and that would be helpful in the magnetoresistive memory and sensor markets. However, there can be no assurance that our pending patent applications or any future applications will be approved, that any issued patents will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties, or that the patents or applications of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business. In addition, there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property, or disclose such intellectual property or trade secrets, or that we can effectively protect our intellectual property.
 We generally control access to and use of our confidential information through employing internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors and customers. We rely in part on U.S. and international copyright laws to protect our mask work. All employees and consultants are required to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment and consulting relationships with us. We also require them to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived or made in connection with the employment or consulting relationship.
 Environmental Regulation
 We must comply with many different federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing processes. Our facilities have been designed to comply with these regulations and we believe that our activities are conducted in material compliance with such regulations. Any changes in such regulations or in their enforcement could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Any failure by us to adequately control the storage, use, discharge and disposal of regulated substances could result in significant future liabilities.
 Increasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of electronic manufacturing operations. While we have not experienced any materially adverse effects on our operations from recently adopted environmental regulations, our business and results of operations could suffer if for any reason we fail to control the storage or use of, or to adequately restrict the discharge or disposal of, hazardous substances under present or future environmental regulations.
 Employees
 At December 31, 2016, we had 90 employees in the United States and 19 full time equivalent contractors and consultants in Singapore, China, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, the United States and Germany. None of our employees are either represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. Financial Information
 Revenue from customers is designated based on the geographic region or country to which the product is delivered or licensee is located are set forth in Note 10 to our financial statements, which information is incorporated by reference
