Item 1.  Business
Overview
U.S. Concrete, Inc. is a Delaware corporation founded and incorporated in 1997. In this report, we refer to U.S. Concrete, Inc. and its subsidiaries as “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” or “U.S. Concrete,” unless we specifically state otherwise, or the context or content indicates otherwise.
U.S. Concrete is a leading heavy building materials supplier of aggregates and ready-mixed concrete in select geographic markets in the United States, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Canada. The Company is focused on growing both organically and through strategic acquisitions in our target markets, particularly within our aggregate products segment. We are a leading supplier for large-scale commercial and industrial, residential and infrastructure (including streets, highways and other public works) construction projects in high-growth markets across the country. We hold leading vertically integrated (aggregates and ready-mixed concrete) market positions in New York City, New Jersey, Dallas-Fort Worth, West Texas and the San Francisco Bay Area. 
In 2017, we completed our largest acquisition to date with the purchase of Polaris Materials Corp. (“Polaris”), a construction aggregate producer in British Columbia, Canada, that sells primarily to customers in the United States. This acquisition added a significant amount of aggregates production and reserves to our portfolio, represented a key step in our vertical integration for the San Francisco Bay Area, and provides us a broader growth platform for the entire West Coast. Beyond our traditional markets, Polaris also serves aggregates-only markets in Southern California and Hawaii. Also in 2017, we acquired Corbett Aggregate Companies, LLC (“Corbett”) located in Quinton, New Jersey, another significant step in vertically integrating our operations. Corbett provided a critical component to our aggregates needs in New York City through our New York Sand & Stone business unit and their network of aggregates terminals. 
We operate principally in our East Region (which we define to include New York City, New Jersey, Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia), our Central Region (which we define as Texas and Oklahoma), and our West Region (which we define to include California and British Columbia, Canada) with those markets representing approximately 34%, 34% and 30%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue for 2019. We believe we are well positioned for strong growth in these attractive regions. 
Total revenue for 2019 was $1.5 billion, of which we derived approximately 86.5% from our ready-mixed concrete segment, 9.6% from our aggregate products segment (excluding $53.5 million sold internally) and 3.9% from our other operations. For 2019, we had net income attributable to U.S. Concrete of $14.9 million. 
We serve substantially all segments of the construction industry in our select geographic markets. Our customers include contractors for commercial and industrial, residential and infrastructure. Ready-mixed concrete product revenue by type of construction activity for the past three years was:

 | 2019 | 2018 | 2017
Commercial and industrial | 60% | 56% | 56% 
Residential | 22% | 25% | 26% 
Infrastructure | 18% | 19% | 18% 

Recent Developments
2020 Acquisition of Aggregates Company in New York
On February 24, 2020, we acquired all of the equity of Coram Materials Corp. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “Coram”) for $142.0 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments (the “Acquisition”). Coram is a premier provider of high-quality sand and gravel products located on Long Island, New York. Coram’s operations supply natural sand to the New York City area, which is used in concrete and other applications across industry sectors and within all construction categories. Coram owns approximately 41.9 million tons of proven and permitted reserves and approximately 7.5 million tons of proven, but unpermitted, reserves. The Acquisition increases the vertical integration of our New York City operations and reduces our dependency on third-party suppliers. In addition, the Acquisition strengthens our competitive position, while furthering our strategy of expanding into higher margin aggregates businesses at attractive valuations. We funded the purchase price for the Acquisition by borrowing 
1

$140.0 million under our asset-based revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”). We have additional committed financing to further support our liquidity needs, and we will seek to refinance or replace this borrowing as conditions permit. The remaining $2.0 million of the purchase price will be paid over the next two years.
Our Competitive Strengths
Large, high quality, vertically integrated asset base in attractive construction markets
Our core competitive strength lies in building strong, vertically integrated market positions in complex urban environments that require manufacturing and time-sensitive delivery of high performance concrete in challenging settings. 
We have developed strategic raw materials sourcing capabilities, particularly our aggregate and sand vertical integration in areas of the country where aggregates are expensive and depleting. These sources coupled with our water borne and strategically located docks further strengthens our self-supply model.
Our ability to internally source aggregates requirements for our most challenging projects, and in every market we serve, gives us a distinct competitive strength. Zoning and permitting regulations make it difficult to permit new quarries and ready-mixed concrete plants in many of the markets we serve. This acts as a barrier to entry that makes our strong market positions more valuable. In addition, our business is uniquely local and given the relatively low selling price of aggregates, transportation costs can quickly exceed the product cost. Further, due to the occurrence of chemical reactions during transport, concrete is a perishable product and must be unloaded within 60 to 90 minutes from being loaded into the mixer truck at the concrete batch plant. These factors serve to make our strategic locations near highly attractive, large and growing construction markets a meaningful competitive advantage.
Our sourcing network extends and supports our large, high quality asset base, which is comprised of more than 195 ready mixed concrete plant facilities, 19 aggregates facilities and seven distribution terminals, and is well positioned to supply large, complex projects in large metropolitan markets that are difficult to serve. Such projects include infrastructure projects with complex Federal Highway Administration or Federal Aviation Administration specifications and extensive delivery requirements. Our comprehensive asset base enables greater efficiencies and asset utilization, while scale leverages purchasing power advantages and delivery and asset utilization efficiencies.
Our national research laboratory, while working closely with each of our regional laboratories, is developing industry leading solutions and ensuring local capability needs are met. Concrete mix design expertise and the ability to meet stringent specifications through the work of these labs is yet another competitive strength that ties the more upstream raw material sourcing and asset base to our downstream value-added products.
Top 3 positions in favorable geographic markets with attractive fundamentals
We operate in favorable construction markets where we believe we have an advantage compared to our competitors given our ability to handle complex projects across a broad array of industry sectors. We have a large, high-quality asset base focused in the Texas/Oklahoma, Northern California, New York City/New Jersey, Washington, D.C. and U.S. Virgin Islands markets. Our management team believes we have a leading market position in all of our geographic markets.
Focus on environmental sustainability
Sustainability and environmentally friendly solutions continue to grow and be in high demand in our industry, and we expect domestic and global sustainable demand to continue to grow at attractive rates. We are a leader in the sustainable concrete market and we take pride in our commitment to deliver these critical solutions. We were the first company in the United States concrete industry to adopt the 2030 Challenge to develop Environmental Product Declarations (“EPD”) for our ready-mixed concrete products. This challenge, issued by Architecture 2030, calls on architecture, planning and building industries worldwide to specify, design and manufacture products that meet specific carbon reduction targets between now and the year 2030. Our operating unit in Northern California, Central Concrete Supply Co., was the first of our business units to adopt the challenge, and our EPD adoption spread across the Company. Currently, our operating units combined have over 15,000 EPDs.
Beyond EPDs, we have found a competitive strength in low CO2 concrete mix designs aimed at reducing a construction project's total carbon footprint. Our national and regional research laboratories have developed significant expertise in concrete mix design, enabling industry leading solutions while ensuring local capability needs are met. For example, our early development of EF® Technology lead to development and adoption of many CO2 reducing capabilities from raw material substitution to injecting CO2 into concrete mixes to sequester it and improve the performance of the concrete. 
Our EF Technology innovation and other sustainability measures also positively affect the performance of the final product, further enhancing our value proposition.
Long-term customer relationships
Our management and sales personnel focus on developing and maintaining successful long-term relationships with our key customers. Customer concentration in our key markets allows us to better serve our new and existing customers with expedited delivery, lower transportation costs and scale efficiencies. Key elements of our customer-focused approach include (i) corporate-level marketing and sales expertise; (ii) technical service expertise to develop innovative new branded products; and (iii) training programs that emphasize successful marketing and sales techniques that focus on the sale of high margin concrete mix designs.
Our customer engagement model results in contractors returning year after year to us as a supplier they can trust. In 2019, no single customer or project accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue. Our broad, yet targeted, customer base enables us to develop an efficient, stable business model and tap into the market in a variety of ways. We believe that by providing high quality, reliable services and customized products and solutions, we are able to maintain important long-term relationships. To further entrench our customer relationships, we have invested in technology, such as our proprietary dispatch and analytics system, Where’s My Concrete?TM, providing a higher level of service and real-time information to our customers.
A top supplier to large and complex commercial projects
We provide alternative solutions for designers and contractors by offering value-added concrete products, such as color-conditioned, fiber-reinforced, steel reinforced and high-performance concrete. We believe this innovation enhances our ability to compete for and win supply contracts for some of the largest and most prestigious commercial projects. 
Solid balance sheet and ample liquidity
We have successfully improved our financial performance by refocusing our financial objectives over the past several years. Our management team has focused on reducing our cost structure while expanding our existing and acquired businesses in our core operating regions to drive strong performance. As a result, we have grown revenue, improved profit margins and increased liquidity. We benefit from available liquidity through our Revolving Facility and cash flow from operations. We believe our solid balance sheet and ample liquidity will allow us to take advantage of strategic opportunities as well as provide ample cushion against general downturns in economic activity.
Demonstrable track record of successful acquisitions
Our ability to replicate our business model successfully through strategic acquisitions is another competitive strength. Our mergers and acquisitions team has deep industry relationships, which facilitate proprietary sourcing of successful acquisitions. A repeatable acquisition and integration process maximizes our synergies.
Experienced management team.
Our senior management team consists of 14 executives with an average of more than 20 years of industry experience and is comprised of individuals with a proven track record in the construction materials industry. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, William J. Sandbrook, and our President and Chief Operating Officer, Ronnie Pruitt, both have over 25 years of construction materials industry experience. Our management team’s deep market knowledge enables us to effectively assess potential new opportunities to solidify our leading market presence. We will continue to focus on recruiting and retaining motivated and knowledgeable professional managers to continue to develop our business and maintain our leading market positions.
These strengths give us distinct competitive advantages, and together have allowed us to grow and continue our positive momentum into the future. The ability to self-supply aggregates and use our technical expertise to design and track our shipments, coupled with our intense focus on operational excellence will further our model of continuous improvement. 
Our Business Strategy 
We strive to be the top one or two producer in the ready-mixed concrete markets we serve and operate in some of the fastest growing and most attractive metropolitan markets in the United States, including New York City, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Dallas-Fort Worth and the San Francisco Bay Area. These markets represent five of the top 12 metropolitan statistical areas. 
Our business is uniquely local. Given the relatively low selling price of aggregates, transportation costs can quickly exceed the product cost. Further, due to the chemical reaction while in the mixer truck, concrete is a perishable product and must be unloaded within 60 to 90 minutes from being loaded at the concrete batch plant. 
Our business strategies are (1) vertically integrate through aggregates, (2) market focus, including growing our markets through acquisitions, (3) do what we know and (4) focus on growing profits. 
Vertically integrate through aggregates
Our ready-mixed concrete operations consume a significant amount of aggregates. Aggregates are a major component in ready-mixed concrete, comprising approximately 75% by weight. We believe our ready-mixed concrete operations where we are vertically integrated through aggregates have a competitive advantage. Internally sourcing aggregates provides a consistent and reliable stream of raw materials for our ready-mixed concrete operations. In addition to consuming high margin aggregates internally, third party sales are available for other aggregate products. These high margin sales enhance our profitability. Aggregates also provide an additional growth segment for us to expand through strategic acquisitions.
Market focus - Go where the people are
Markets drive our strategic growth initiatives. There are 11 identified megaregions in the United States that drive 75% of the gross domestic product and house 70% of the nation’s population, but only represent 20% of the U.S. land mass. By focusing on these megaregions, we can be very deliberate on how and when we enter markets. Further, by being selective on which markets we want to be in and the projects we want to pursue, we can spend more time on developing relationships with the targets we prioritize. We are focused on building strong, defensible positions in strong, growing and vibrant markets, which are very difficult to replicate. 
Do what we know
We expect to be a leading supplier of heavy building materials in our current and future markets. We are dedicated to increasing our aggregates positions and related downstream products, such as ready-mixed concrete. 
Drive margin improvement
We are focused on driving continuous improvement, resulting in increasing profit margins. We believe we are best in class in ready-mixed concrete margins, but there is still more work to be done. We will continue to push new technology, sales programs, raw material sourcing, and any opportunity to drive more profit while operating safely. 
Our Industry
The aggregates industry produces engineered granular materials consisting of crushed stone, gravel, and sand of varying mineralogies, manufactured to specific grades and sizes for use in downstream construction applications. Crushed stone, sand, and gravel are used as aggregate in foundations for infrastructure and buildings or as road base. Crushed stone is also an input to cement, concrete products, and personal consumer goods. The National Stone, Sand & Gravel Association (“NSSGA”) estimates that the U.S. domestic production and use of construction aggregates amounted to 2.5 billion tons of crushed stone, sand and gravel, valued at $25.1 billion. The aggregates industry employs approximately 100,000 highly skilled men and women. Due to high transportation costs, approximately 90% of aggregates are consumed within 50 miles of the place of extraction. 
Ready-mixed concrete manufacturers produce concrete and deliver it in an unhardened state to end users, such as contractors, who then place and form the concrete at construction sites. Downstream applications include commercial, industrial, residential, infrastructure, and other construction sectors. The industry is composed of varying sized family owned businesses to multi-national corporations. As concrete is a perishable product, production facilities are typically located within 60 to 90 minutes from construction projects. The National Ready Mixed Concrete Association (“NRMCA”) estimated there were about 6,800 ready-mixed concrete plants and 70,000 ready-mixed concrete mixer trucks that delivered approximately 371 million cubic yards of product to the point of placement, accounting for $40 billion in revenue across the United States in 2019. 
The key drivers for aggregates and ready-mixed concrete include infrastructure funding, residential construction spending, private nonresidential construction spending, fluctuations in interest rates, weather conditions, and national, regional and local economic conditions. Ready-mixed concrete and aggregates are used in streets and highways, foundations and suspended floors, tilt walls, transportation terminals, sporting stadiums and petrochemical plants, among other uses. Private investment is influenced by long-term interest rates. A low inflationary outlook and interest rate stability foster investment in construction markets, which increases the demand for ready-mixed concrete and aggregates. 
We expect that U.S. infrastructure, including transportation, water and other systems, will continue to benefit from strong investment for years to come. The country's vast network of transportation infrastructure, power grids and communications facilities are aging and in need of repair and upgrade. In 2017, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave U.S. infrastructure a grade of D+, indicating significant under investment. In 2018, the Department of Transportation reported that 64% of highways were in less than good condition and 25% of bridges were in need of significant repair amounting to an estimated backlog of $836 billion of capital and investment needs. 
U.S. residential new construction peaked in 2006 before the economic downturn drove new home construction to Depression-era levels. Since 2011, the recovery of residential new construction has generated increasing demand for aggregates and concrete. We expect the housing recovery to continue, supported by strong job creation, a high level of consumer confidence, and millennials increasingly entering the housing market. Average industry forecasts from leading industry associations (e.g., National Association of Homebuilders, National Association of Realtors, Mortgage Bankers Association and Fannie Mae) suggests total housing starts (both single and multi-family) will grow from 1.29 million in 2019 to 1.39 million in 2021, representing a 3.6% compounded annual growth rate.
The non-residential construction market contracted significantly during the economic downturn as the construction of commercial buildings such as office buildings, warehouses, commercial and industrial buildings slowed. In recent years, however, the market has experienced sustained growth as the economy continues a slow but steady recovery. The steady recovery of the non-residential construction industry is observed in the Dodge Momentum Index, a leading indicator which has shown steady improvement in the market since the economic downturn. We expect continued job growth, low office vacancy rates, and overall gross domestic product ("GDP") growth to continue to support the non-residential construction market. According to the American Institute of Architects Consensus Construction Forecast, the U.S. non-residential construction sector is expected to grow 1.5% through 2020, followed by 0.9% growth in 2021.
Our Products
Aggregate products
We produce crushed stone, sand and gravel from 19 aggregates facilities located in New Jersey, Texas, Oklahoma, the U.S. Virgin Islands and British Columbia, Canada. We sell these aggregates for use in commercial, industrial and public works projects in the markets we serve, as well as consume them internally in the production of ready-mixed concrete. We produced approximately 11.5 million tons of aggregates during the year ended December 31, 2019, with British Columbia, Canada representing 43%, Texas and Oklahoma representing 32%, New Jersey representing 22% and the U.S. Virgin Islands representing 3% of the total production. While we consumed 34% of this production internally in 2019, we currently sell the majority of our aggregate products to third parties. We believe our aggregates reserves provide us with additional raw materials sourcing flexibility and supply availability.
Ready-mixed concrete 
Our standard ready-mixed concrete products consist of proportioned mixes we produce and deliver in an unhardened plastic state for placement and shaping into designed forms at the job site. Selecting the optimum mix for a job entails determining not only the ingredients that will produce the desired permeability, strength, appearance and other properties of the concrete after it has hardened and cured, but also the ingredients necessary to achieve a workable consistency considering the weather and other conditions at the job site. We believe we can achieve product differentiation for the mixes we offer because of the variety of mixes we can produce, our volume production capacity and our scheduling, delivery and placement reliability. Additionally, we believe our environmentally friendly technology initiative, which utilizes alternative materials and mix designs that result in lower CO2 emissions, helps differentiate us from our competitors. We also believe we distinguish ourselves with our value-added service approach that emphasizes reducing our customers’ overall construction costs by reducing the in-place cost of concrete and the time required for construction. 
Our volumetric concrete operations, the largest volumetric operation in the country, expand our ready-mixed concrete delivery and service offerings primarily in Texas. Volumetric ready-mixed concrete trucks mix concrete to the customer's specification on the job site, better serving smaller jobs and specialized applications, and allowing flexibility for servicing remote job locations. Because of their versatility, these trucks offer the contractor multiple options for a single job without the inconvenience or added costs typically associated with standard ready-mixed trucks delivering special or short-loads to a job site. Because of their unique on-demand production capabilities, these trucks minimize the amount of wasted concrete, which improves margins and reduces environmental impact. 
We also provide portable and mobile concrete plants for high-volume or remote projects. While currently operating predominantly in our existing regions, our fast-track mobilization business unit, U.S. Concrete On-Site, Inc., can dispatch a portable or mobile ready-mixed concrete plant anywhere in the continental U.S. These mobile solutions have reached an exceptional level of turnkey operations customized to deliver outstanding on-site solutions for all types of concrete construction. Not only are we providing industry leading concrete production operations to our customers, we are providing technical services and a substantial mitigation of risk with on-site production. 
Other
Other products include our building materials stores, hauling operations, aggregates distribution terminals, a recycled aggregates operation and concrete blocks. Two specific products included in this category are ARIDUS® Rapid Drying Concrete technology and the Where’s My Concrete? family of web and mobile applications. 
ARIDUS Rapid Drying Concrete reduces the drying time and risks associated with excess moisture vapor in concrete slabs, enabling faster, more effective floor topping installations. ARIDUS was developed and patented by U.S. Concrete’s National Research Laboratory, USC Technologies, Inc., to address changes in environmental government regulations that limit or restrict volatile organic compounds in flooring adhesives. 
Where’s My Concrete? is our real-time cloud-based data delivery program that helps concrete producers provide value-added service and transparency to their customers, while improving their own business through critical analytics and operational efficiencies. We use this program in our operations as well as market it to third parties.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 
We obtain most of the raw materials necessary to manufacture ready-mixed concrete on a daily basis. These materials include water, cement and other cementitious materials (such as fly ash and slag), aggregates (stone, gravel, and sand), and chemical admixtures. A standard cubic yard of concrete typically weighs 4,125 pounds and includes approximately 250 pounds of water, 550 pounds of cementitious material, 1,525 pounds of sand, and 1,800 pounds of stone. 
Cement is the binding agent used to bind water, crushed stone, and sand, in the production of ready-mixed concrete. Other industrial byproducts such as fly ash from coal burning power plants and slag from the manufacture of iron and silica fume have cementitious properties that allow it to be used as a substitute for cement, depending on specification. We purchase cementitious materials from a few suppliers in each of our major geographic markets. Aggregates are typically produced locally and are procured from a network of internal and external suppliers in each of our markets. In 2019, our ready-mixed concrete businesses purchased 34% of their aggregate products needs from internally operated quarries and sites. Chemical admixtures are generally purchased from suppliers under national purchasing agreements. 
With the exception of chemical admixtures, each plant typically maintains an inventory level of these materials sufficient to satisfy its operating needs for a few days. Inventory levels do not decline significantly or comparatively with declines in revenue during seasonally lower periods. We generally maintain inventory at specified levels to maximize purchasing efficiencies and to be able to respond quickly to customer demand. Generally, we negotiate with suppliers on a company-wide basis and at the local market level to obtain the most competitive pricing available. 
Competition
Because of the impact of transportation costs on the aggregates industry, our competition in the aggregates product segment tends to be limited to producers in proximity to each of our facilities. The industry is highly fragmented and includes smaller private aggregates producers in addition to large, national companies. All of our locations experience competition from local companies in addition to larger public companies. Competition is based on location, price, quality of aggregates and level of customer service. Our primary public company competitors are Cemex S.A.B. de C.V., CRH PLC, Heidelberg Cement AG, LafargeHolcim Ltd., Martin Marietta Materials, Inc., Summit Materials, Inc. and Vulcan Materials Company. Companies in the industry tend to grow by acquiring existing facilities to enter new markets or expand their existing market positions.
The ready-mixed concrete industry is highly competitive. Our leadership position in a market depends largely on the location and operating costs of our plants and prevailing prices in that market. Price is the primary competitive factor among suppliers for small or less complex jobs, such as residential construction. However, the ability to meet demanding specifications for strength or sustainability, timeliness of delivery and consistency of quality and service, in addition to price, are the principal competitive factors among suppliers for large or complex jobs. Our competitors range from small, owner-operated private companies to subsidiaries of operating units of large, vertically integrated manufacturers of cement and aggregates. Our vertically integrated 
competitors generally have greater financial and marketing resources than we have, providing them with a competitive advantage. Competitors having lower operating costs than we do or having the financial resources to enable them to accept lower margins than we do will have a competitive advantage over us for jobs that are particularly price-sensitive. Competitors having greater financial resources or less financial leverage than we do may be able to invest more in new mixer trucks, ready-mixed concrete plants and other production equipment or pay for acquisitions, which could provide them a competitive advantage over us. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we had 712 salaried employees, including executive officers and management, sales, technical, administrative and clerical personnel and 2,461 hourly personnel. The number of employees fluctuates depending on the number and size of projects ongoing at any particular time, which may be impacted by variations in weather conditions throughout the year.
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
A wide range of federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations apply to our operations, including the following matters:

• | water usage;


• | land usage;


• | street and highway usage;


• | noise levels;


• | operating hours; and


• | health, safety and environmental matters.

In many instances, we are required to have various certificates, permits, or licenses to conduct our business. Our failure to maintain these required authorizations or to comply with applicable laws or other governmental requirements could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct some of our operations. Delays in obtaining approvals for the transfer or grant of authorizations, or failures to obtain new authorizations, could impede acquisition efforts.
Environmental laws that impact our operations include those relating to air quality, solid waste management and water quality. These laws are complex and subject to frequent change. They impose strict liability in some cases without regard to negligence or fault. Sanctions for noncompliance may include revocation of permits, corrective action orders, administrative or civil penalties and criminal prosecution. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances. In addition, businesses may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances, as well as damage to natural resources. These laws also may expose us to liability for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, others or for acts that complied with all applicable laws when performed.
We have conducted Phase I environmental site assessments, which are non-intrusive investigations conducted to evaluate the potential for significant on-site environmental impacts, on substantially all the real properties we own or lease and have engaged independent environmental consulting firms to complete those assessments. We have not identified any environmental concerns associated with those properties that we believe are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, but we can provide no assurance material liabilities will not occur. In addition, our compliance with any amended, new or more stringent laws, stricter interpretations of existing laws, or the future discovery of environmental conditions could require additional, material expenditures.
We believe we have all material permits and licenses we need to conduct our operations and are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements relating to our operations. We have certain emissions credits that expand our sales capacity in California for Polaris aggregate products.
