Company Overview
American Software, Inc. (“American Software” or the “Company”) was incorporated in Georgia in 1970. The Company is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia with U.S. offices in Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Indianapolis, New York, St. Louis, Miami, Pittsburgh and San Diego; and international offices in the United Kingdom, India, New Zealand and Australia.
We provide our software and services solutions through three major operating segments; (1) Supply Chain Management (“SCM”), (2) Information Technology Consulting (“IT Consulting”) and (3) Other. The SCM software business is our core market. We also offer technology staffing and consulting services through our wholly-owned subsidiary, The Proven Method, Inc., in the IT Consulting segment, and we continue to provide limited services to our legacy enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) customers included in the Other segment.
Table of Contents

Our primary operating units under our SCM segment are Logility, Inc. and Demand Management, Inc. (“DMI”). Logility is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and DMI is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Logility, Inc. Each operating unit focuses on the segment of the marketplace where their expertise lies.
American Software delivers an innovative technical platform that enables enterprises to accelerate their digital supply chain optimization from product concept to customer availability. Our brands leverage a single platform spanning eight supply chain process areas, including demand optimization, inventory optimization, supply optimization, retail optimization, quality and compliance, product lifecycle management (“PLM”), sourcing management and integrated business planning. Our Digital Supply Chain Platform includes advanced analytics and is fueled by supply chain master data, allowing for the automation of critical business processes through the application of artificial intelligence (“AI”) and machine learning algorithms to a variety of internal and external data streams.
We believe enterprises are facing unprecedented rates of change and disruption across their operations. Increasing consumer expectations for convenience and personalization, fast and free delivery and product freshness are forcing enterprises to adapt or be left behind. Given constraints arising from a shortage of skilled supply chain talent and a desire to keep costs at a minimum, we expect enterprises to embrace digital transformation initiatives to meet these challenges. Our solution reduces the business cycle time required from product concept to customer availability. Our platform provides to our customers a digital twin of their physical supply chain networks that improves the speed and agility of their operations by implementing automated planning processes that evaluate multiple business scenarios. These processes continuously analyze business and market signals to better inform product design and development, increase forecast accuracy, optimize inventory across the supply chain and in retail locations, and ensure high customer satisfaction.
Our platform is highly regarded by customers and industry analysts alike. We are named a leader in multiple IDC MarketScape reports including; the September 2020 report IDC MarketScape: Worldwide PLM Applications for Apparel, Footwear, and Retail Brands 2020 Vendor Assessment; the January 2020 report IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Supply Chain Supply Planning 2019 Vendor Assessment; and the January 2020 report IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Supply Chain Demand Planning 2019 Vendor Assessment.
We have been positioned in the Leaders quadrant in Gartner, Inc.’s (“Gartner”) February 22, 2021 report, Magic Quadrant for Supply Chain Planning Solutions. We believe our platform is rated highly due to our flexible advanced analytics, underlying Software as a Service (“SaaS”) architecture, ease of integration with third-party systems, lower total cost of ownership relative to competitors and the broad scope of supply chain planning functions supported.
We serve approximately 910 customers located in approximately 80 countries, largely concentrated within key vertical markets including apparel and other soft goods, retail, food and beverage, consumer packaged goods, durable goods, chemical and process manufacturing, and life sciences. Our solutions are marketed and sold through a direct sales team (Logility) as well as an indirect global value-added reseller (“VAR”) distribution network (DMI). While our solutions may be deployed in the cloud or on-premise, customers are increasingly opting for our cloud-based SaaS deployments. We further support our customers with an array of consulting, implementation, operational and training services as well as technical support and hosting.
We derive revenue from four sources: subscriptions, software licenses, maintenance and services. We generally determine SaaS subscription and software license fees based on the breadth of functionality and number of users and/or divisions. Services and other revenues consist primarily of fees from software implementation, training, consulting services, hosting and managed services. We bill for services primarily under time and materials arrangements and recognize revenue as we perform services. Subscription and maintenance agreements typically are for a three- to five-year term. We generally bill these fees annually in

advance and then recognize the resulting revenue ratably over the term of the agreement. Deferred revenue represent advance payments or fees for subscriptions, software licenses, services and maintenance billed in advance of the time we recognize the related revenue.
Market Opportunity
Today’s manufacturers, distributors and retailers must respond to rising consumer expectations to buy anywhere, deliver anywhere and return anywhere, even as global economic conditions and competitive pressures force businesses to reduce costs, decrease order cycle times and improve operating efficiencies. To meet these demands, we believe businesses must dramatically improve the performance of their supply chains, which can only be achieved through automation, artificial intelligence and advanced analytics. We leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms throughout our supply chain management software platform, enabling enterprises to accelerate the cycle time from product concept to customer availability.
Supply chain management refers to the process of managing the complex global network of relationships that organizations maintain with external trading partners (customers and suppliers) to design products, forecast demand, source supply, manufacture products, distribute and allocate inventory and deliver goods and services to the end customer. Supply chain management involves the activities related to sourcing and supplying and merchandising products or services as well as the sales and marketing activities that influence the demand for goods and services, such as new product introductions, promotions, pricing and forecasting. Additional aspects of supply chain management include comprehensive sales and operations planning (“S&OP”) as well as product lifecycle management (“PLM”), product sourcing quality and vendor compliance, to ensure the right products are brought to market on time and in good condition. Companies that effectively communicate, collaborate and integrate with their trading partners across the multi-enterprise network or supply chain can realize significant competitive advantages in the form of lower costs, greater customer loyalty, reduced stock-outs, more efficient sourcing, reduced inventory levels, synchronized supply and demand and increased revenue.
Gartner’s March 2021 report, Forecast: Enterprise Application Software, Worldwide, 2019-2024, 1Q21 Update, predicts spending on Supply Chain Management software solutions will exceed $16 billion in 2021 and reach $28 billion by 2025. This represents a compounded annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 13.64% through 2025. Within the Supply Chain Management software market, Gartner includes solutions for supply chain planning, supply chain execution and procurement. We focus primarily on supply chain and retail planning processes and certain procurement and execution functions, which we estimate account for approximately one-third of the Supply Chain Management software market as defined by Gartner. Our platform includes more than thirty components spanning eight key supply chain planning processes that customers may adopt independently or as a comprehensive solution platform. We believe our opportunity to cross-sell and up-sell existing customers is significant, given the potential for customers to adopt additional components over time. 
Our supply chain optimization and retail planning functions use information and analysis to facilitate the on-time delivery of the right products to the right place, at the right time and at the optimal total cost. The planning process includes demand forecasting and sensing, inventory and supply optimization, distribution, manufacturing planning and scheduling, sales and operations planning, retail financial planning, assortment and allocation, PLM, global sourcing and vendor compliance. Planning software is designed to increase revenue, improve forecast accuracy, optimize manufacturing scheduling, better leverage inventory investments, decrease order cycle times, reduce transportation costs and improve customer service. Customers are increasingly adopting planning, sourcing and optimization software that is implemented and accessed in the cloud.

Our supply chain execution functions address sourcing, manufacturing, distributing and delivering products to customers throughout the global network. Within the supply chain execution function, organizations are increasing their focus on vendor compliance and sourcing linked with supply chain planning and other enterprise applications, in order to increase the efficient and effective fulfillment of customer orders in both the business-to-business and the business-to-consumer sectors. These multi-enterprise supply chains have heightened the need for robust supply chain master data management (“MDM”) to provide an accurate digital twin of the supply chain network, allowing enterprises to quickly plan strategically and accurately respond to dynamic market conditions to take advantage of business opportunities and mitigate risk.
In order to effectively manage and coordinate supply chain activities, companies require integrated business planning, S&OP, supply chain planning, allocation, sourcing, supply chain execution, and supply chain analytics software that enables integrated communication, optimization and collaboration among the various constituents throughout the supply chain network. Our advanced cognitive platform helps ensure that each stakeholder is aligned in order to minimize costs, increase service levels and deliver exceptional customer service.
Company Strategy
Our goal is to deliver the fastest time to value for our customers to achieve an agile, resilient and higher velocity sustainable supply chain. Our strategy includes the following key elements:
Create Sustainable Supply Chains for Our Customers. By enabling our customers to shorten their supply chains, reduce energy consumption, reduce water usage, increase the use of recyclable material, enforce proper labor practices and track products through their entire lifecycle, we enable them to achieve more sustainable operations and improve conditions in the world we live in.
Focus on Integrated Digital Supply Chain Platform. We believe we are one of the few providers of truly innovative and comprehensive SCM platform solutions addressing demand, supply and advanced retail planning as well as quality and compliance, PLM and sourcing management. We intend to continue focusing our development initiatives on enhancing our product concept to customer availability platform, expanding its embedded performance management architecture and introducing additional capabilities that complement our integrated solution suite.
Maintain Technology Leadership. We believe we are a technology leader in collaborative supply chain optimization solutions and advanced business analytics. We believe we were one of the earliest providers to introduce a collaborative supply chain planning solution to support multi-enterprise supply chain network planning. We intend to continue to provide innovative, advanced solutions and services to our current and future customers.
Leverage and Expand Installed Base of Customers. We intend to continue to leverage our installed base of approximately 910 customers by introducing additional functionality, product upgrades, and complementary components. In addition, we intend to expand sales to new customers in our existing vertical markets and to target additional vertical markets over time. We will continue our focus on offering a best-in-class cloud solution and expect the growth we have experienced in this area to continue, as many customers are pursuing cloud strategies for their business applications.
Expand Strategic Relationships. We are increasingly working with industry-leading consultants and other software and services providers. Our strategic partnerships help us to grow more quickly and to more efficiently deliver our products and services. We intend to continue to develop strategic relationships with systems integrators and other providers to combine our software solutions with their services and products and create joint marketing and co-development opportunities.
Increase Penetration of International Markets. In the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021, we generated 15% of our total revenue from international sales, primarily resulting from marketing relationships with a number of international distributors. 
Table of Contents

We have 20 VARs in the indirect channel, most of which are international. This experienced global distribution network expands our reach and provides sales, implementation and support resources, serving customers in approximately 80 countries. We intend to further expand our international presence using direct sales personnel where appropriate and by creating additional relationships with distributors in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America and South America.
Acquire or Invest in Complementary Businesses, Products and Technologies. We believe that selective acquisitions or investments may offer opportunities to broaden our product offering for our target markets. We will evaluate acquisitions or investments that will provide us with complementary products and technologies, expand our geographic presence and distribution channels, penetrate additional vertical markets with challenges and requirements similar to those we currently meet, and further solidify our leadership position within the SCM market.
Products and Services
We provide a comprehensive, cloud-architected supply chain management platform that helps customers manage eight critical planning processes, including demand optimization, inventory optimization, supply optimization, retail optimization, quality and compliance, PLM, sourcing management and integrated business planning.

Customers frequently require services beyond our standard support and maintenance. To meet those customers’ needs, our professional services team provides specialized business and software implementation consulting, development and configuration, system-to-system interfacing and extensive training and certification. We offer these services for an additional fee, usually based upon time and materials utilized. We provide the following professional services to our customers:
Cloud Hosting and Managed Services. Our customers can deploy our solutions in a hosted or on-premise environment. Companies may choose and then adjust the deployment methodology and services that best suit their individual needs as their business changes and their IT strategies evolve.

No customer accounted for more than 10% of fiscal 2021 revenue. We typically experience a slight degree of seasonality, reflected in a slowing of services revenue during the winter holiday season, which occurs in the third quarter of our fiscal year. We are not reliant on government-sector customers.
Competition
Our competitors are diverse and offer a variety of solutions targeted at various aspects of the supply chain, retail and general enterprise application markets. Our existing competitors include, but are not limited to:

•Other business application software vendors that may broaden their product offerings by internally developing, acquiring or partnering with independent developers of supply chain management software; and 
•Internal development efforts by corporate information technology departments. 
We also expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the market for advanced retail planning and supply chain management software and/or introduce new products and technologies. In addition, current and potential competitors have made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties.
The principal competitive factors in the target markets in which we compete include product functionality and quality, domain expertise, integration technologies, product suite integration, breadth of products, and related services such as customer support, training and implementation.

We manage sales and/or support outside of North America from our international offices in the United Kingdom, India, New Zealand and Australia.
Table of Contents

In addition to our direct sales force, we have developed a network of VARs who assist in selling our products globally. We will continue to utilize these and future relationships with software and service organizations to enhance our sales and marketing position. Currently located in North America, South America, Mexico, Europe, South Africa, and the Asia/Pacific region, these independent distributors and resellers distribute our product lines domestically and in foreign countries. These vendors typically sell their own consulting and systems integration services in conjunction with contracts for our products. Our global distribution channel consists of 20 organizations with sales, implementation and support resources serving customers in approximately 80 countries.
Marketing and communications contribute significantly to our growth and the demand for our products and services in the market. We made significant changes in the last year to modernize the marketing department and increase focus on digital promotion. We raise market awareness of our brands and engage with the prospective market through concentrated marketing and communications programs. The consolidation of resources supporting the entire SCM business that has occurred over the last year will provide the Company with an opportunity to amplify a unique and market leading value proposition. We do this through a variety of marketing efforts, including public and media relations, direct marketing, advertising, events, and industry influencers. We also collaborate and participate in a variety of global industry associations, such as those organized by the Association for Supply Chain Management, the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals, and the Institute of Business Forecasting.
Research and Development
Our success depends in part upon our ability to continue to recognize and meet customer needs, anticipate opportunities created by changing technology, adapt our products to the changing expectations of our customer community, and keep pace with emerging industry standards. As a part of our ongoing commitment to these goals, we continue to focus on the people, processes, and technology that help to achieve them. We are committed to partnering with our customers in co-development efforts to ensure our products map well to market needs from day one. We are continually shortening release cycles to more rapidly respond to market opportunities. We leverage design thinking approaches to ensure that we understand not only the expressed needs of our customers, but also the lived realities of the people that use them to accomplish their supply chain goals each and every day.
We continue to leverage the opportunities presented by artificial intelligence, machine learning, advance analytics platforms, in-memory computing, and alternative data management approaches as well as advancing research efforts in the application of blockchain and other technologies with promise in supply chain use cases. Our research and development efforts will continue to focus on deploying solutions within a complex global supply chain landscape. Our cloud-architected solutions designed for SaaS deployment with master data management built in will be increasingly important for our long-term growth. As of April 30, 2021, we employed 97 persons in product research, development and enhancement activities. We also engage contractors for research and development, bringing our total resources to 170 persons.
Proprietary Rights
Our success and ability to compete are dependent in part upon our proprietary technology. To protect this proprietary technology, we rely on a combination of copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality obligations and other contractual provisions. However, we also believe that factors such as the knowledge, ability, and experience of our personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements, reliable maintenance and timeliness and quality of support services are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position. The source code for our proprietary software is protected as a 
Table of Contents

trade secret and as a copyrighted work. Generally, copyrights expire 95 years after the year of first publication. In addition, we have registered a number of trademarks in the U.S. and internationally and have applications pending for others. We enter into confidentiality or similar agreements with our employees, consultants and customers, control access to and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary information, and deliver only object code (compiled source code) to our licensed customers. As is customary in the software industry, in order to protect our intellectual property rights, we do not sell or transfer title to our products to our customers.
Human Capital Resources
As of April 30, 2021, we had 424 full-time employees, including 97 in product research, development and enhancement, 44 in customer support, 164 in professional services, 75 in marketing, sales and sales support, and 44 in accounting, facilities and administration. Of these, 355 are based in the United States and 69 are based in our international locations. Our operations are further supported by over 100 independent contracts. We have never had a work stoppage and no employees or contractors are represented under collective bargaining arrangements.
Core Values. Our corporate culture is based on our core values: Passion, Accountability, Curiosity, and Teamwork. Employee performance and Company fit are assessed in part based on these core values. We reinforce them in employee communications and celebrate extraordinary examples of these values with quarterly “Living the Core Values” awards for employees nominated by colleagues and selected by the executive leadership team.
Talent and Career Development. We support and encourage continuous learning, training and career development for all employees. In addition to our general new hire orientation, employees are trained on job-specific requirements, as well as topics such as cybersecurity, data privacy, anti-harassment and anti-bullying.
Employee career development is a key focus in the attraction, retention and management of our human capital resources. Our quarterly success planning process allows each employee to discuss career development goals with his or her manager and to provide feedback on broader company processes, to help both the employee and the Company become more successful. Success plans are tracked via the employee portal, which senior management monitors to ensure full participation. 
Community Engagement. We believe in the importance of giving back to the communities where we live and work. Our Community imPACT initiative has two major components. We organize Company-sponsored volunteer opportunities with selected organizations across our geographic locations that focus on combating food insecurity. We also encourage our employees to take action in their own communities by volunteering with charitable organizations of their choice, and we support their efforts by providing up to 16 hours of paid time off each year for individual volunteering.
COVID-19 and Employee Safety. During the COVID-19 pandemic our primary focus has been the health and safety of our employees and their families. We encouraged all employees to transition to remote work, implemented additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work, and restricted travel to essential business-critical needs. We have taken a flexible approach to help our employees manage their work and personal responsibilities. In addition, we have provided our employees with health and wellness resources, such as up-to-date COVID information and counseling resources. Our CEO and President has provided COVID-19 updates in all of our monthly all-hands town hall calls, and we believe that these transparent, ongoing communications have been critical to maintaining our productivity during the pandemic. As a result, we have been able to seamlessly transition to primarily virtual work without interruption.

Data Privacy
Regulatory and legislative activity in the areas of data protection and privacy continues to increase worldwide. We have established and continue to maintain policies to comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws. We also ensure that third parties processing data on our behalf are contractually obligated to follow or are otherwise compliant with such laws.
We are subject to certain privacy and data protection laws in other countries in which we operate, many of which are stricter than those in the United States. Some countries also have instituted laws requiring in-country data processing and/or storage of data. Most notably, in the European Union (“EU”) and United Kingdom (“UK”), the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and comparable UK law create legal and compliance obligations for companies that process personal data of individuals in the those regions, regardless of the geographical location of the company, and impose significant fines for non-compliance. We process a limited amount of personal data (as defined under the GDPR) for our customers and act as a data controller with respect to the personal data of our employees and job applicants, some of whom are located outside the United States. Therefore, our privacy policies comply with the GDPR.
In the United States, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) requires us to offer certain specific data privacy rights to California residents. Other states have adopted or are considering similar requirements that may be more stringent and/or expansive than federal requirements. Our privacy policies are compliant with the CCPA and other existing state laws.
Data Security
Information Security Management. Our Software Security Program is managed by our Cybersecurity Manager, who reports to the Senior VP Technology. We conduct vendor and internal risk assessments at least annually. Our Security Incident Response Team, consisting of personnel from Legal, Human Resources, Marketing, and IT across our business units, is responsible for implementing our Incident Response Policy and Procedure, which includes processes for detection, analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery, as well as an annual tabletop exercise.
Our employees are regularly trained on appropriate security measures. We provide security awareness training for new hires, and for all employees at least quarterly. We conduct user testing through “phishing” campaigns and require remedial training based on results. Our Cybersecurity Manager produces a monthly security awareness newsletter and periodic updates on recent malicious information security trends and scams.
The Service Organization Control (SOC) 2 Type II examination demonstrates that an independent accounting and auditing firm has reviewed and examined an organization’s control objectives and activities, and tested those controls to ensure that they are operating effectively. The Company obtains a SOC 2 Type II report annually based on an independent third-party audit. The third party examines the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of the Company’s controls to provide reasonable assurance that our service commitments and system requirements were achieved based on the applicable trust services criteria for security, availability, processing integrity and confidentiality.
Customer Data Security. We have web application firewalls and data encryption (both in transit and at rest) to ensure that our customer data is adequately protected. Our software applications undergo manual code reviews, static code analysis to test for vulnerabilities, and annual third-party penetration testing, with a formal change control process in place to correct any deficiencies. Our SaaS environments are safeguarded by vulnerability management software that detects Operating Systems ("OS") and third-party application vulnerabilities; applies vulnerability patching on a monthly basis; and ensures emergency patching of critical vulnerabilities. Data security is monitored with fully-integrated Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) software, and we provide 24/7 security monitoring and alerting for all SaaS customer environments.

approved users may access our SaaS environments, and such access is further controlled through two-factor authentication and quarterly access reviews.
Data in our cloud-based solutions is hosted in a Microsoft Azure environment. Microsoft provides numerous security measures, including geo-redundant storage (GRS) with cross-regional replication for storage of backup data, and site recovery that replicates virtual machines ("VMs") in real-time to a different Azure region.
Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery. We have a documented Disaster Recovery Procedure and Business Continuity Plan. Key actions and responsibilities are handled by a designated Disaster Recovery Team and Emergency Management Team, respectively. The policies and procedures are reviewed, updated, and approved by executive management annually, and a Business Impact Analysis is performed as part of our Business Continuity Plan.
Sustainability in Data Operations
Hosting. Sustainability is a critical factor when we evaluate potential hosting partners. We continue to expand our partnership with Microsoft, including increases in our Azure footprint for hosting customer SaaS environments as well as many internal operations. Microsoft has been carbon neutral since 2012 and is committed to being carbon negative by 2030, with the commitment by 2050 to remove all the carbon it has directly emitted since its founding in 1975. Our primary hosting partner, Microsoft Azure, has committed to focus on four key areas of environmental impact on local communities—carbon, water, waste, and ecosystems:
a.100% renewable energy by 2025
b.Water positive by 2030 (replenish more water than consumed)
c.Zero-waste certification by 2030
d.Net-zero deforestation for all new data centers.
Data Destruction & Sanitation Policy. Third parties perform secure destruction of media and we receive a certificate of secure destruction from such parties. Items for destruction or recycling are processed using an environmentally friendly waste-to-energy incineration process or e-Stewards® certified recycling process so that the information cannot be reconstructed.
