Products

Before July 5, 2017, EMERALD DATA INC. executed contracts with J and K Industrial Limited, LINHAI FEELWAY LEISURE PRODUCTS CO., Magic Style International Co., Ltd., Ningbo Grand Ocean International CO., Ltd., NINGBO JIADA LEISURE PRODUCTS CO., LTD. and Patio Design. 

After a management change on July 5, 2017, new management made the decision to change the business model to food blogging. Although initially growing at a fast rate, we were not able to convert the growth momentum into a revenue stream. Within weeks we had more than 800 subscribers to several food blogs, but realized that viable sponsorship income could not be derived from covering low end Hong Kong and Macao foods places. 

We then adjusted the strategy in early 2018 to cover fine dining bars, restaurants and wine places in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, as research had shown relevant sophisticated buying power and thus higher sponsorship potential from high-end restaurants there. 

In June 2018 management entered into talks with an online boat sales platform under development by Mr. Yves Toelderer, evaluating the creation of an additional business line operating a global online boat market place. Upon Toelderer providing evidence of a minimum viable product (“MVP”) for the boat sales platform, definitive agreements were negotiated and the BOATIM platform was acquired. Integrating the BOATIM project into our product range reflects an important part of the Company´s strategic business development. We intend to combine our reach and relationships within the Asian online community and our e-commerce marketing capabilities with the rolling subscription for service model of BOATIM and intend to establish steady revenue streams this way. Our contacts to the online world in Asia as well as our presence in the new Florida head offices will be of substantial benefit when developing and eventually rolling out our additional online product.

Equally, with the BOATIM platform intended to attract many of boat owners, sellers and lovers, we intend to create a big social and commercial community around the subject of boats. This is intended to occur both globally and locally at the same time.

Since, our business model is two sided. Side one devotes our efforts mostly to advertisement and sponsored content. The second side is to offer the promotional services of a sales platform with integrated sales communication processes for the boating community and industry.

Marketing

To extend and publicize the latest network trend, Boatim Inc. intends to use direct and online marketing methods attract clients to come onto our blog and online platform to advertise their business.

If the netizen speaks in the company’s blog, it will be free to express their personal satisfaction or dissatisfaction to the blog. A person to ten people even thousands are free to discuss, to make comments. In a brief period, there can be tens of thousands of netizens in the discussion creating the attention and the publicity intended for the clients.

By joining an affiliate program is a great way to make money promoting products and services you love. Basically, once you refer a product through an affiliate program and customer make a purchase, we intend to get a revenue share from the transacting client.

Market Overview

Regardless of which industry, internet is used as a marketing tool for a variety of sales and services thus reducing cost of networking or even introducing entirely new distribution channels.

Therefore, with these connections, it will help clients grow their restaurant and boat selling businesses and connect with bloggers and other members of the community through our platforms for a vital part of their digital marketing strategy.
