ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
General 
 We are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation on November 12, 2020 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as our initial business combination. We may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any industry or sector. 
 In December 2020 and January 2021, our sponsor and our independent directors purchased an aggregate of 7,187,500 founder shares in exchange for a capital contribution of $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share. Prior to the initial investment in the company of $25,000 by the sponsor and independent directors, we had no assets, tangible or intangible. The per share price of the founder shares was determined by dividing the amount of cash contributed to the company by the number of founder shares issued. The number of founder shares outstanding was determined based on the expectation that the total size of our initial public offering would be a maximum of 28,750,000 units if the underwriters’ over-allotment option was exercised in full, and therefore that such founder shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares after our initial public offering. The over-allotment option was exercised in full on March 4, 2021; thus, these shares are no longer subject to forfeiture. 
 The registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-252624) for our initial public offering was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 1, 2021. On March 4, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 28,750,000 units, including the issuance of 3,750,000 units as a result of the underwriters’ full exercise of their over-allotment option, with each unit consisting of one share of Class A common stock and one-sixth of one redeemable warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The units in our initial public offering were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating total gross proceeds of $287,500,000. 
 Simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering and the full over-allotment option, we consummated the private placement of an aggregate of 5,600,000 private placement warrants to our sponsor at a price of $1.50 per private placement warrant, generating total gross proceeds of $8,400,000. 
 A total of $287,500,000 (or $10.00 per unit sold in our initial public offering) of the net proceeds from our initial public offering and the private placement was placed in a trust account established for the benefit of our public stockholders, with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and has been invested only in U.S. “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), having a maturity of 185 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, until the earliest to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business combination; (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by March 4, 2023; and (iii) absent an initial business combination by March 4, 2023 or with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, our return of the funds held in the trust account to our public stockholders as part of our redemption of the public shares. 
 Our units began trading on March 2, 2021 on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbol “AMPI.U.” Commencing on April 22, 2021, the shares of Class A common stock and warrants comprising the units began separate trading on the NYSE under the symbols “AMPI” and “AMPI WS,” respectively. Those units not separated continue to trade on the NYSE under the symbol “AMPI.U.”

  Our Sponsor 
 Our sponsor is affiliated with Houlihan Lokey, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, “Houlihan”), a leading global investment bank, and Saddle Point Management, L.P. (“Saddle Point”), a New York-based registered investment adviser. A majority of our sponsor is owned by affiliates of Houlihan, with the balance owned by affiliates of Saddle Point. 
 We believe that Houlihan occupies a unique market position as a leading advisor to market participants in attractive industries, with particular strength in advising private companies and financial sponsors in the middle market, a market segment which is a focus of our selection process. Houlihan is the No. 1 investment bank for all global M&A transactions, the No. 1 M&A advisor for the past seven consecutive years in the U.S., the No. 1 global restructuring advisor for the past eight consecutive years, and the No. 1 global M&A fairness opinion advisor over the past 20 years, all based on number of transactions and according to data provided by Refinitiv. Houlihan has expertise in mergers and acquisitions, capital markets, financial restructurings, and financial and valuation advisory services, with 37 offices throughout the United States, Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region. The firm covers major industry segments including business services, consumer, food & retail, data & analytics, energy, financial institutions, healthcare, industrials, real estate, lodging & leisure, and technology, media & telecom. As of December 31, 2021, Houlihan had approximately 2,200 employees professionals globally, 22 of which are senior officers in its Financial Sponsors Group, which covers over 1,200 private equity, credit and hedge funds, family offices, endowments, pension funds, and sovereign wealth funds globally. Houlihan serves more than 2,000 clients. Houlihan’s bankers and professionals have developed clients and deep relationships across industry sectors from which we seek actionable investment opportunities. 
 We believe that our relationship with Houlihan positions us well to capitalize on what we believe to be a secular shift that recognizes there are a variety of ways of “going public” and that doing so by way of a business combination with a blank check company such as ours will be advantageous for certain companies. We believe that Houlihan’s extensive network of relationships with companies and financial sponsors across various sectors provide us significant advantages in sourcing an attractive candidate for a business combination. Moreover, we believe that Houlihan’s deep domain expertise in relevant industry verticals can add value to us after the initial business combination through strategic advice and in future mergers and acquisitions and capital markets transactions. A significant focus of our business combination search efforts is on companies that can benefit from Houlihan’s services during and/or following an initial business combination transaction. 
 Saddle Point is a manager of a co-founder of our Sponsor, and Saddle Point’s founder and Chief Executive Officer, Roy J. Katzovicz, serves as our Chief Executive Officer. The principals of Houlihan and Saddle Point share a working relationship that goes back more than a decade and spans mergers and acquisitions, restructurings and shareholder engagements. In addition, since the launch of Saddle Point’s first fund, Maxima Fund I, L.P. in August 2019, Houlihan’s Financial Sponsors Group has covered the firm and has had direct access to its team, investment process and selected research. Our relationship with Saddle Point provides us access to an independent investment team of experienced principal investors willing to risk their own capital. Saddle Point is an investment adviser that invests on behalf of clients and principal accounts with capital principally in public mid- and large-cap U.S. equities. Saddle Point manages funds and advises accounts that are in the business of trading – buying and selling – securities and financial instruments. 
 As part of its investment program, Saddle Point raises capital from institutional investors and high-net worth families, foundations, and trusts to form special purpose vehicles dedicated to an investment in a single company, principally through listed U.S. equities. Beneficial owners of Saddle Point’s clients, accounts and relationships include active participants in the market for blank check company initial public offerings as well as private investments in public offerings for blank check company business combination transactions. We believe certain of those accounts will be included among our prospective investors. Members of Saddle Point’s investment team support our efforts, along with Gregory S. Lyss, a Saddle Point affiliate, who serves as our Chief Operating Officer. Prior to this, Mr. Lyss served as the Chief Investment Officer for TABLE Management, L.P., a single-family office. Mr. Lyss has extensive experience investing in public markets and in structuring, negotiating and investing in private companies.

  Saddle Point’s team and affiliates have significant experience investing in U.S. and U.K.-listed blank check companies. That experience includes investing in blank check companies, helping source potential business combination transactions, structuring and negotiating transactions and/or reviewing potential initial business combination transactions sourced by the sponsors of the relevant blank companies prior to commitment by those companies. Collectively, through their affiliated firms, they have invested in over 10 blank check companies from 2005 to 2017 that raised an aggregate of over $7 billion in their initial public offerings. 
 Saddle Point employs a multi-disciplinary approach to investing, drawing from microeconomics, finance, accounting, operations management, legal and regulatory expertise and human psychology. Saddle Point employs a fundamental, bottom-up process to understand how a business makes money. Its investment team typically builds its understanding of a company and its end markets through deep due diligence, analysis of historic performance, direct person-to-person interviews with management, industry experts, customers, suppliers, competitors and other stakeholders, third party research and its own financial modeling. Through its work, Saddle Point seeks to identify high-conviction, concentrated investments that generate superior long-term returns. With the added benefit of private information and due diligence available to us from target companies prior to any business combination transaction, we believe that this focus and approach is well-oriented toward a successful result for our stockholders. 
 Our asset selection, due diligence, and transaction execution process seeks to leverage the breadth and depth of Houlihan’s industry knowledge and relationships with companies and financial sponsors and Saddle Point’s multi-faceted investment approach. To that end, our investment process is supported by a team of investment professionals from Saddle Point and its affiliates (the “Saddle Point Investment Team”) and is overseen by an investment committee (the “Investment Committee”) that, in addition to our Chief Executive Officer, includes Houlihan senior bankers and executives as well as other independent investors experienced in sourcing, executing and funding public and private equity investments. 
 We aim to seek and attract prospective target companies that see merit in signaling their long-term prospects by partnering with us on a due diligence, valuation and capital commitment process that highlights their existing value and growth potential. We believe that the combination of Houlihan’s connectivity and industry and transactional expertise and Saddle Point’s expertise in public market investing makes us an attractive partner to prospective target companies that would make compelling candidates for an initial business combination.

Investment Criteria and Guidelines 
 We have developed the following high level, non-exclusive investment criteria that we use to screen for and evaluate target businesses. We use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating 
 acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. 
 Business Quality: Our target selection process seeks to maximize the probability of a business combination with a company whose equity will yield a strong risk-adjusted return over a long-term investment horizon. We believe that outcome is more likely if we target businesses that we believe are fundamentally sound and well operated, with an emphasis on defensible marketplace positions and prospects for growth. 
 
10 

  Growth: We believe that some of the most compelling business combination opportunities are companies that present meaningful potential for organic growth by serving growing end markets and/or increasing their market share. In addition, a significant focus of our search process is on acquisition targets that can leverage Houlihan’s expertise and network for growth M&A and capital raising. 
 Value Creation: We look for value through a combination of (1) the strength of management, (2) a clear plan to build incremental value through operational and/or strategic excellence, (3) the ability to generate, strong, sustainable and growing free cash flow, (4) a clear path to bring the target company to the public market and implement best-in-class public company governance and (5) an attractive valuation entry point. 
 Proprietary Sourcing: Generally, we do not expect to participate, in broadly marketed processes or auctions, but rather seek to leverage our extensive network and deep industry and market participant relationships as well as those of Houlihan and Saddle Point, our board of directors, Investment Committee members and affiliates to source our business combination. We seek to partner with the owners of private companies to offer them an option to create partial liquidity, transition their legacy to a public company and/or resolve any fragmented ownership or succession planning issues, while maintaining a focus on driving the target business to a higher level of performance and value. 
 Value-Added Benefits: We seek to acquire a business that would benefit from our extensive networks, insights and operating and financial capabilities. 
 These criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this Annual Report, would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, that we would file with the SEC. 
 Our Acquisition Process 
 In evaluating a prospective target business, we conduct a due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as applicable, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction. We seek to benefit from Houlihan and Saddle Point’s experience, as well as their network of relationships with chief executive officers, board members and members of executive management teams to provide specialized insights into their areas of expertise as well as leverage their operational and capital planning experience. 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors or completing the business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent financial advisor which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm, that such initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. 
 Members of our management team directly or indirectly own our common stock and/or warrants following our initial public offering, and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors is included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. 
 
11 

  Our officers and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. 
 Initial Business Combination 
 The NYSE rules and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation require that we complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the target’s assets or prospects. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately, or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. Additionally, pursuant to the NYSE rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors. 
 We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the prior owners of the target business, the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or is otherwise not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the NYSE’s 80% fair market value test described above, provided that in the event that the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions and we will treat the target businesses together as our initial business combination for purposes of a seeking stockholder approval or conducting a tender offer, as applicable. 
 To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. 
 In evaluating a prospective target business, we conduct a due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as applicable, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction. The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. Other than as described herein, we do not intend to pay any consulting fees to members of our management team for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination.

 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we have encountered, and may continue to encounter, competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other special purpose acquisition companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. 
Human Capital Resources 
 We currently have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. 
Our Website 
 Our corporate website address is https://www.advancedmerger.com. The information contained on, or accessible through our corporate website or any other website that we may maintain is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, as well as any amendments and exhibits to these reports, filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are available on our website, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. Alternatively, you may access these reports at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. 
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 
 We have registered our units, Class A common stock, and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 
 We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may conduct an initial business combination with because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential business combination candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.

  We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such business combination. 
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. 
 Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year or the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30.
