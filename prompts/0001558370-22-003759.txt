ITEM 1.       BUSINESS
Summary of Business Results and Plans
In September 2019 a holding company reorganization was completed in which Famous Dave’s of America, Inc. (“FDA”) became a wholly owned subsidiary of the new parent holding company named BBQ Holdings, Inc. (“BBQ Holdings”). As used in this Form 10-K, “Company”, “we” and “our” refer to BBQ Holdings and its wholly owned subsidiaries. BBQ Holdings was incorporated on March 29, 2019 under the laws of the State of Minnesota, while FDA was incorporated in Minnesota on March 14, 1994. We develop, own and operate restaurants under the name “Famous Dave’s”, “Village Inn”, “Granite City”, Real Urban Barbecue”, “Clark Crew BBQ”, “Tahoe Joe’s Steakhouse”, and “Bakers Square.” Additionally, we franchise restaurants under the name “Famous Dave’s” and “Village Inn”. As of January 2, 2022, there were 143 Famous Dave’s restaurants operating in three countries, including 39 Company-owned restaurants and 104 franchise-operated restaurants. The Clark Crew BBQ restaurant opened in December 2019 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. BBQ Holdings has a 20% ownership in this venture. In March 2020, we purchased 18 Granite City Food & Brewery restaurants throughout the Midwest and one Real Urban Barbecue restaurant located in Vernon Hills, Illinois. On July 30, 2021, we completed the purchase of the Village Inn family restaurant concept with 21 Company-owned restaurants and 108 franchised restaurants, and the Bakers Square pie and comfort food concept currently with 14 Company-owned restaurants and four locations where the Bakers Square pies are licensed. On October 4, 2021, we opened our second Real Urban Barbecue restaurant located in Oak Brook, Illinois and on October 8, 2021 we acquired the Tahoe Joe’s Steakhouse brand. 
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) as a pandemic and the United States declared a National Public Health Emergency. As a result, public health measures were taken to minimize exposure to the virus. These measures, some of which are government-mandated, have been implemented globally resulting in a dramatic decrease in economic activity. Reopening of restaurant dining rooms resumed, generally at reduced capacity, at various points since mid-2020. While restrictions on the type of permitted service and occupancy capacity continued to change in various jurisdiction, currently nearly all of our restaurants are operating with no capacity restrictions on indoor dining. We cannot predict the severity of another surge, what additional restrictions may be enacted, to what extent we can maintain off-premise sales volumes, whether we can maintain sufficient staffing levels, or if individuals will be comfortable returning to our dining rooms during or following social distancing protocols, and what long-lasting effects the COVID-19 pandemic may have on the restaurants industry as a whole. The potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer spending behavior, which may be a function of continued concerns over safety and/or depressed consumer sentiment due to adverse economic conditions, including job losses, will determine the significance of the impact to our operating results and financial position. Although we have experienced some recovery from the initial impact of COVID-19, the long-term impact of COVID-19 and its variants on the economy and on our business remains uncertain, the duration and scope of which cannot currently be predicted (see Item 1A — Risk Factors). Due to the continuous development and fluidity of this situation, we cannot determine the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our consolidated financial condition, liquidity, and future results of operations.

Of the 100 Company-owned restaurants, 11 are ghost kitchens operating out of the kitchen of another restaurant location or a shared kitchen space. Of the 216 franchise-operated restaurants, 23 are ghost kitchens operating out of the kitchen of another restaurant location or a shared kitchen space. 
Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we refer to certain metrics of our franchise-operated restaurants; however, franchise-operated restaurants are not owned by us and therefore are not included in our consolidated results of operations and financial position. We believe that disclosure of certain information related to franchise-operated restaurants provides useful information to investors as the performance of franchise-operated restaurants directly impacts royalty and other revenues that we receive from our franchisees and has an impact on the perceived success and value of the Famous Dave’s and Village Inn brands.
Financial Information about Segments
Since its inception, our revenue, operating income and assets have been attributable to the single industry segment of the foodservice industry. Our revenue and operating results for each of the last two fiscal years, and our assets for each of the last two fiscal years, are disclosed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Narrative Description of Business

Famous Dave’s Overview
Famous Dave’s restaurants, a majority of which offer full table service, feature wood-smoked and off-the-grill entrée favorites that fit into the barbeque category. We differentiate ourselves by providing high-quality food in distinctive and comfortable environments with signature décor and signage. Our prototypical design includes a designated bar, a signature exterior smokestack, a separate entrance for our to-go business and a patio. The Famous Dave’s concept can be adapted to fit various location sizes and desired service styles such as full-service, counter-service or line-service. 
Each restaurant features a distinctive selection of authentic hickory-smoked and off-the-grill barbecue favorites, such as flame-grilled St. Louis-style and baby back ribs, Texas beef brisket, Georgia chopped pork, country-roasted chicken and signature sandwiches and salads. Also, enticing side items, such as corn bread, potato salad, coleslaw and Wilbur Beans®, accompany the broad entrée selection. Handmade desserts, including bread pudding and banana pudding, are another specialty. To complement our entrée and appetizer items and to suit different customer tastes, we offer six regional barbeque sauces: Rich & Sassy®, Texas Pit ®, Georgia Mustard®, Devil’s Spit®, Sweet and Zesty® and Wilbur’s Revenge ®. These sauces, in addition to a variety of seasonings, rubs, marinades and other items are also distributed in retail grocery stores throughout the country under licensing agreements. 
Our Famous Dave’s restaurants are free-standing units which average approximately 6,000 square feet in size and are typically open from 11:00am to 10:00pm. 
Village Inn Over Overview
Village Inn is focused on family dining and appeals to a large segment of the population, and we believe it has a strong reputation for fast and friendly service, fresh food and reasonable prices. We are known for serving fresh breakfast items throughout the day, including our Ultimate Skillet meals, made-from-scratch buttermilk pancakes and fluffy three-egg omelets. We have also successfully leveraged our strong breakfast heritage to establish a well-developed brand platform encompassing a broad selection of traditional American fare for lunch and dinner, at price-points that position us in the mid-range of the family-dining segment. Village Inn also offers a variety of signature freshly baked pies. We frequently review and update our menus with the assistance of our team of in-house research and development chefs to enhance the attractiveness of our menu offerings to our customers. Customer loyalty is one of Village Inn’s strongest characteristics, with a significant number of customers who patronize our restaurants three or more times a month. 
Our Village Inn restaurants are predominantly free-standing units which average approximately 5,000 square feet in size and can seat between 120 and 180 people. We are typically open from 6:00am to 10:00pm, allowing us to effectively generate revenue in all three-day periods. To improve our efficiency and purchasing power, our menus are standardized throughout the United States, with some variations driven by regional preferences.
Granite City Overview
The Granite City restaurant theme is upscale casual dining with a wide variety of menu items that are prepared fresh daily, including Granite City’s award-winning signature line of hand-crafted beers finished on-site. The extensive menu features moderately priced favorites served in generous portions. Granite City’s attractive price points, high service standards, and great food and beer combine for a memorable dining experience. 
Our prototypical Granite City restaurant consists of an approximately 9,800 square foot facility conveniently located just off one or more interstate highways and centrally located within the respective area’s retail, lodging and transportation activity. Granite City restaurants have open atmospheres as well as floor-to-ceiling window systems creating, where designs permit, expansive views of outdoor patio areas used for dining during warm weather months. This window treatment allows activity to be viewed both inside and outside the restaurant and creates a bright, open environment. We use granite and other rock materials along with natural woods and glass to create a balanced, clean, natural interior feel. The interiors are accented with vintage photographs of the local area brewing industry, as well as historical photos of the community landscape. We believe our design creates a fun and energetic atmosphere that 

5



promotes a destination dining experience. Our Granite City restaurants are free-standing units and are typically open from 11:00am to 11:00pm. 
In addition to operating our restaurants, we operate a centralized beer production facility which facilitates the initial stages of our brewing process. The product produced at our beer production facility is then transported to the fermentation vessels at each of our Granite City restaurants where the brewing process is completed. We believe that this brewing process improves the economics of microbrewing as it eliminates the initial stages of brewing and storage at multiple locations. Our company holds patents by the United States Patent and Trademark Office for our brewing process and for an apparatus for distributed production of beer. 
Real Urban Barbeque Overview
Real Urban Barbecue built its reputation on authentic, wood-fired BBQ favorites. Real Urban’s award-winning menu is served in a comfortable, casual environment built around a line service model that is efficient for operators and convenient for guests. The casual BBQ theme at Real Urban is highlighted by unique custom-designed BBQ-centric décor, roadside signage, and handwritten menus proudly displayed on oversized chalkboards. The interior is designed around corrugated metal, barn wood accents, and a warm color scheme that enhances the dining experience. We believe the casual, neighborhood environment created by the custom décor and comfortable booths creates a local hangout that guests are proud to have in their neighborhood. Guests can find all the BBQ staples including ribs, brisket, pork, chicken, and sausage. The sizeable menu also includes a variety of side dishes and handmade desserts. After opening in 2012, Real Urban quickly became known for its sweet and savory BBQ sauce that is proprietary to the brand. Guests crave the smooth, tomato-based sauce that is the perfect blend of savory and sweet. 
Real Urban or as it is affectionately known to regulars, RUB, differentiates itself by generating revenue from several lines of business. Dine-in, takeout, catering and a robust consumer packaged goods business all contribute to the success of Real Urban. A strategic partnership with Lou Malnati’s Taste of Chicago catalog has allowed the concept to ship large quantities of products nationwide. 
Our Real Urban BBQ restaurants are in-line or end-cap units which average approximately 4,500 square feet in size and are typically open from 11:00am to 9:00pm. 
Clark Crew BBQ Overview
Clark Crew BBQ launched in December 2019 with great anticipation from the community in Oklahoma City. Featuring premium, slow-smoked proteins, and hand-crafted sides, Clark Crew quickly became one of the top-grossing restaurants in all of Oklahoma. The concept was built around one of the most decorated pitmasters to ever compete on the KCBS BBQ circuit, Travis Clark. Travis and his crew have competed on the biggest BBQ stages in the world and racked up over 700 Top-10 awards, along with World Championships, National Team of the Year, and Oklahoma Team of the Year before shifting their focus to opening a BBQ restaurant that would allow Travis to share his talents with the masses. In partnership with BBQ Holdings the dream to open Clark Crew BBQ was quickly realized when all parties involved had the same goal; to create an upscale BBQ concept that offers competition quality BBQ to the communities it serves. BBQ Holdings has a 20% ownership interest in this venture. 
The Clark Crew restaurant theme was built around a dedicated smokehouse that would be the pride of any pitmaster. Featuring Old-Hickory and Camelback high-end smokers and ample room to produce some of the world’s best BBQ, the smokehouse provides great viewing opportunities for guests entering the restaurant while the sweet smoky smell of BBQ fills the neighboring community. Boasting over 8,000 square feet, Clark Crew’s footprint is the perfect size for the flagship location of an emerging BBQ concept.
Tahoe Joe’s Overview
Tahoe Joe’s Famous Steakhouse is a lodge-styled, quality-driven, value-oriented blend of casual and fine dining elements known for its scratch-made, theme-based creations and use of Choice grade beef which has resulted in proven, cross-demographic appeal. Many ingredients are locally sourced and feature, cultured sour dough, almond wood-fired 

6



grill, and top graded beef relative to competitors. Each restaurant design is inspired by a first-rate ski lodge in the Sierra Nevada Mountains that provides a destination property, and aspirational branding draw. Lake Tahoe remains California’s premier ski destination, providing a relevant foundation for the brand’s continued success. Tahoe Joe’s price-point uniquely positions itself in the “goldilocks” zone of the steakhouse segment. Additionally, when compared to the high-end steakhouses in the segment, it is one of the most affordable concepts that features Choice grade beef. 
Our Tahoe Joe’s restaurants are free-standing units which average approximately 7,000 square feet in size and can generally seat between 160 and 200 people. We are typically open from 11:00am to 11:00pm.
Bakers Square Overview
The Bakers Square concept began in 1983 when Poppin Fresh Pies restaurants were acquired from the Pillsbury Restaurant Group. The foundation of the Bakers Square concept is our signature freshly baked pies, which traditionally have accounted for 25% of Bakers Square’s sales. Building upon our reputation for quality pies, we have extended our offerings to include popular traditional American fare for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Bakers Square offers a variety of multi-layer specialty pies made from premium ingredients, which differentiates the concept from our family-dining competitors. Many of our customers complement their lunch or dinner with a serving of pie, while others purchase whole pies for at-home consumption throughout the year, and particularly around the holidays. As with Village Inn, we use our team of in-house research and development chefs to regularly update the Bakers Square menu offerings to attract a wider demographic range of diners and increase repeat business from existing customers. 
Our Bakers Square restaurants are free-standing units which average approximately 4,500 square feet in size and are typically open from 11:00am to 10:00pm. As with Village Inn, our menus are standardized across the United States, with some variations driven by regional preferences.
Growth
In fiscal year 2021, our franchise system opened 22 Famous Dave’s locations. Of these, 18 were ghost kitchens* and four were brick and mortar Famous Dave’s locations. We also acquired four franchise Famous Dave’s that now operate as Company-owned restaurants**. In addition, we opened one Company-owned Real Urban BBQ location and one of our Village Inn franchisees opened one Village Inn for a total of 28 locations.

A summary of the 28 openings in fiscal year 2021 follows: 
​
Ghost kitchen locations either operate out of the kitchen of another restaurant location or a shared kitchen space. 
In fiscal year 2021, in partnership with one of our franchise groups, we opened our new line-service prototype design in Coon Rapids, Minnesota. This design was built from the learnings we had opening our smaller footprint locations, as well as the current model being executed at our Real Urban BBQ locations. Through our new prototypes for Famous Dave’s and Village Inn, along with our ghost kitchen locations, we expect 12-16 units to open in fiscal year 2022. We offer conversion packages that provide our franchisees with the flexibility to convert existing restaurants. Given the flexibility and scalability of our concepts, we believe that there are a variety of development opportunities available now and in the future. 
In fiscal year 2022, we expect to open our new Village Inn prototype in Omaha, Nebraska. Also, in 2022, we expect to open two Company-owned locations including a Village Inn dual concept with Granite City and a Famous Dave’s ghost kitchen in a Granite City. Finally, in the fourth quarter of 2022 or the first quarter of 2023, we expect to open two line-service prototype restaurants in Arizona.
Operating Strategy
Our ability to achieve sustainable, profitable growth is dependent upon delivering consistent, high-quality food and hospitality. Key elements of our strategy include the following: 
During fiscal year 2021, we continued to focus on operational excellence and integrity, and on creating a consistently enjoyable guest experience, both in terms of food, food delivery and hospitality, across our system. While this changed throughout the year as we dealt with the pandemic, we believe our commitment to our guests remained intact as we evolved our service models. 
We define operational excellence as an unyielding commitment to superior service for our guests during every visit. We continue to look for ways to provide convenience and value to our guests through reducing ticket times and streamlining off-premise operations. Operational excellence involves daily monitoring to ensure we execute our recipes at a high level, inclusive of preparation, cooking, and handling procedures, rotation, sanitation, cleanliness and safety. 
Our menus focus is on several popular smoked, barbequed, grilled meats, entrée items, baked pies, breakfast favorites, delicious side dishes and appetizers all of which are prepared using proprietary seasoning ingredients, sauces and mixes. In order to enhance our appeal, expand our audience, increase frequency, and feature our crave-able products, our culinary team has worked tirelessly to continue to innovate in the ever-changing landscape.

Human Resources and Training/Development - A key ingredient to our success lies with our ability to hire, train, engage and retain employees at all levels of our organization. We place a great deal of importance on creating an exceptional working environment for all of our employees. Through our training and development resources, tools and programs, we continually enhance and support superior performance within our restaurants and support center.
We are a performance-based organization, committed to recognizing and rewarding performance at all levels of the organization. Our performance management process includes performance-calibration as a means of providing measurable, comparative employee evaluations relative to peer contribution, taking into account specific core competencies and goals. It is designed to provide a complete picture of performance that is consistent across the organization. We offer a total rewards program that is benchmarked closely against the industry and includes health and welfare coverage, 401(k) and non-qualified deferred compensation with a company match, base pay and incentive pay programs developed to sustain our competitive position in the market. Our human resource and training teams focus on the selection and retention of talent through programs in overall workforce planning, performance management, development, safety and risk reduction, and continued enhancements in our organizational structures for all positions in the business.
In the training and development arena, we offer a variety of ongoing on-the-job and classroom and eLearning training programs for the operations teams (hourly employees, restaurant managers) in an effort to create defined career paths. Our management training program provides new restaurant managers a foundational-based training for restaurant operations and several learning sessions focused on the basic behaviors and skills of a manager.
Restaurant Operations
Our ability to manage multiple concepts in geographically diverse locations is central to our overall success. In each market, we place specific emphasis on the position of the general manager and seek talented individuals that bring a diverse set of skills, knowledge, and experience to our company. We strive to maintain quality and consistency in each of our restaurants through the careful training and supervision of employees and the establishment of, and adherence to, high standards relating to performance, food and beverage preparation, and maintenance of facilities. 
All managers must complete an eight-week training program, during which they are instructed in areas such as food quality and preparation, customer service, hospitality, and employee relations. We have prepared operation manuals relating to food and beverage quality and service standards. New employees participate in training under the supervision of our management. We have a comprehensive operations scorecard and training tool that helps us measure the operational effectiveness of our restaurants. We have a senior vice president of operations who is responsible for overseeing all Company-owned restaurants. This individual, as well as our directors of operations for each brand and area directors, works closely with the store-level management to support day-to-day restaurant operations. In addition, the senior vice president and directors of operations assist in the professional development of our area directors and store-level management. They are instrumental in driving our vision of operational integrity and contributing to the improvement of results achieved at our restaurants, including building sales, developing personnel, and growing profits. 
Off-Premise
In addition to our lively and entertaining dine-in experience, we provide our guests with maximum convenience by offering an expedient take-out service along with catering and third-party delivery. The level of take-out varies from concept to concept. As an example, to-go business at Famous Dave’s accounts for approximately 55% of total revenue, in comparison to Granite City where to-go business is approximately 21% of total revenue. High quality, fair prices and avoidance of preparation time, make take-out of our product particularly attractive. The BBQ brands have a unique competitive advantage in the to-go line of business; the food stays fresh longer and travels well. Our off-premise sales provide us with revenue opportunities beyond our in-house seating capacity and we continue to seek ways to leverage these segments of our business. We see catering and delivery as a tremendous opportunity for new consumers to access our business. 
At Famous Dave’s, our restaurants have been designed specifically to accommodate a significant level of to-go sales, including a separate to-go entrance with prominent and distinct signage, and, for added convenience, we separately 

9



staff the to-go counter. To further enhance sales for all our brands, we offer our guests the ability to order online to improve convenience. We believe our focus on to-go enables us to capture a greater portion of the “take-out” market by allowing consumers to “trade within our brands,” when dining in is not always an option. We pursue efforts to increase awareness of to-go in all Company-owned and franchise-operated restaurants by featuring signage and merchandising both inside and outside the restaurants. Additionally, we contract with several Delivery Service Providers (“DSP”) to offer our guests additional methods for receiving our food. 
Off-Premise Technology – We believe that we earn a significant amount of repeat business by providing high-quality food, efficient friendly service, and adequate technology that streamlines the guests ordering experience and our operating procedures. In 2021, we eliminated all third-party tablets from our operations. Digital orders are now directly injected into our Point-of-Sale system using technology developed by our online ordering provider, OLO. This allows several operational efficiencies to ensure order accuracy, but most importantly, helps create labor efficiencies. We are also piloting a new curbside enhancement program that enables guests to simply text or click a link in their order confirmation email to notify the restaurant electronically when they arrive. This provides a streamlined curbside solution with the goal of increasing order frequency.
Marketing, Promotion and Sales
BBQ Holdings’ brands primarily rely on digital marketing, direct marketing, social media, word of mouth and strategic partnerships to acquire new guests. At our core, BBQ Holdings is focused on building a best-in-class digital footprint and online guest experience for all brands. The internal marketing team is responsible for the advertising, promotion, creative development and branding for all the BBQ Holdings concepts. Franchise-operated Famous Dave’s and Village Inn restaurants place the advertising and marketing programs in their local market based on contractual requirements. 
Our focus on collecting first-party data began paying off for several BBQ Holdings’ brands in 2021, including Famous Dave’s and Granite City. Loyalty sales were up 59% through the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 for Famous Dave’s, and Granite City exceeded 25,000 loyalty members within six months of launching the program. Marketing automation, recall campaigns and highly targeted marketing messages are being delivered to loyalty members, SMS subscribers and guests purchasing through our e-commerce channels. These tools will be implemented at Village Inn, Bakers Square, Real Urban BBQ, Clark Crew and Tahoe Joes in 2022. 
In fiscal year 2021, all of our brands experienced an increase demand for dine-in sales versus 2020. New and improved happy hour specials, Daily Deals and dine-in-only specials were offered at multiple brands to help improve guest counts and maximize dine-in sales opportunities. We expect our off-premise business to continue to be strong as in-restaurant dining trends improve. Promotions with delivery service partners were leveraged during strategic times throughout the year for each brand. Inclement weather and the ongoing pandemic have presented an opportunity to increase delivery sales through third-party apps and the BBQ Holdings’ brands are well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities. 
We successfully leveraged our internal marketing channels, as well as paid-social media campaigns during all the major holidays in 2021. Bundled theme meals and special occasion offers were utilized across the brands to build sales on key holidays such as Mother’s Day, Easter, Father’s Day, Labor Day and Thanksgiving. Famous Dave’s surpassed 2019 and 2020 sales figures on every major holiday in 2021. Other calendar events such as National Pork Month, National Beer Month, National Pancake Day, National Pie Day and many others will be leveraged for creative marketing promotions designed to spark interest and incite trial. A comprehensive marketing calendar has been developed for each brand to leverage holidays and seasonal events.

10



Value Proposition and Guest Frequency – We remain competitive with our value offerings across our brands and are committed to offering consistent, quality products at a compelling everyday value. We offered Famous Deals throughout fiscal year 2021 at Famous Dave’s and Granite City. The value offerings are intended to drive weekday dine-in traffic. Not only did the offers increase traffic, but we were also able to successfully maintain check averages and profit by requiring the purchase of a beverage with the purchase of a Daily Deal. Daily Deals were also instrumental in driving traffic back to Granite City locations in 2021. The Daily Deals promotion featured $5 burgers and many other food and drink specials. Granite City’s guests quickly responded to the offers and guest counts steadily increased. Daily Deals averaged well over 9,000 units per week sold and we have continued to maintain that volume into fiscal year 2022. All our brands benefited from the rollout of family-style meal options. Each of these promotional offers was built around value and convenience, allowing guests to feed a group of four for as little as $29.99. Bundled meal deals, 2-for-$20 offers, free delivery, and free dessert promotions were also used across the brands in fiscal year 2021 to further reinforce our value message. Daily Deals will be evaluated and updated quarterly to provide new product news to our guests and protect margins. 
BBQ Holdings successfully launched a virtual concept, $5 Burgers, in all Company-owned Famous Dave’s locations in 2021. Village Inn and Bakers Square offer Village Bowls, a delivery-only virtual concept. This added incremental revenue at over 100 locations systemwide. Granite City and Johnny Carinos locations served as ghost kitchens for Famous Dave’s, resulting in over $8,000 in average weekly sales at top performing locations. Virtual concepts and ghost kitchens will be instrumental in 2022 to maximize revenue and improve operating margins for each brand. 
In fiscal year 2021, Famous Dave’s and Granite City aggressively pursued additional gift card sales through retail expansion. Major retailers, such as Target, Amazon and Costco are now offering branded gift cards for both brands. Gift card sales increased 282% and 276% respectively, over 2020. Village Inn gift cards will be rolled out to retail locations in 2022 through strategic partnerships with Blackhawk Networks, Incomm, Costco and Sam’s Club. 
The BBQ Holdings team manages a marketing fund for Famous Dave’s and Village Inn locations. A percentage of sales is contributed from participating Company-owned and franchise locations. These funds are used to develop advertising campaigns, promotional materials, and fund key digital initiatives such as the loyalty program, SMS platform, website maintenance, and operational costs of the gift card expansion project. 
Location Strategy
We prepare an overall market development strategy for each market. The creation of this market strategy starts with identifying trade areas that align demographically with the target guest profile. The identified trade areas are then assessed for viability and vitality and prioritized by sales and unit-level margin opportunities for future development. Since markets are dynamic, the market strategy includes a continual and ongoing assessment of all existing restaurant locations. If financially feasible, a restaurant may be relocated as the retail or residential focus in a trade area changes. 
In addition to assessing markets and trade areas for full-service development, we are also looking at opportunities to build smaller footprint restaurants. These lower-cost, line service buildouts based on a Fast-Casual/QSR restaurant model offer a convenience alternative to our larger, destination-oriented restaurants. We can develop new markets using this convenience model or use them as fill-ins in areas where our restaurants are already present but have under-serviced populations. 
The ghost kitchen service model will allow us to access new markets or strategically locate restaurants in existing markets where a full-service or small footprint line service restaurant is unlikely to be financially viable. The trade area will determine which restaurant type is appropriate. 
We expect to continue to grow our Famous Dave’s and Village Inn franchise programs. Our goal is to continue to improve the economics of our current restaurant prototypes, while providing more cost-effective development options for our franchisees. We believe the new prototypes launching last year for Famous Dave’s and this year for Village Inn will allow for this expansion.

Purchasing
In order to maximize the quality and operational efficiencies of our food products, we strive to obtain consistent quality items at competitive prices from reliable sources, including identifying secondary suppliers for many of our key products. Additionally, our secondary suppliers help us assure supply chain integrity and better logistics. Finally, to reduce freight costs, we continually aim to optimize our distribution networks, where the products are shipped directly to the restaurants through our foodservice distributors. Each restaurant’s management team determines the daily quantities of food items needed and orders such quantities to be delivered to their restaurant. 
Approximately 90% of our food and non-alcoholic beverage purchases collectively across brands are on contract, with the majority being proteins. In the three barbecue-centric brands, pork represents approximately 32% of our total purchases, while beef, which includes hamburger and brisket, is approximately 14%, chicken is approximately 14%, and seafood is approximately 2%. In our Granite City brand, beef represents 21% of total purchases, while poultry is approximately 16%, seafood is 3%, various other proteins make up approximately 12%, and produce makes up approximately 8% of our spend. In the Village Inn and Bakers Square brands, approximately 29% of our total purchases are proteins, desserts & confections make up 18%, processed and fresh produce make up 12%, and 10% of our purchases are dairy products. In the Tahoe Joe’s brand 48% of purchases are beef and pork, 8% is poultry, and 7% is seafood. 
We leverage our spend across our various brands and, where applicable, align contract pricing on like items to drive down landed costs. Our purchasing team is also responsible for managing the procurement of non-food items for our restaurants, including restaurant equipment, smallwares and restaurant supplies. 
Information Technology
We recognize the importance of leveraging information and technology to support and extend our competitive position in the restaurant industry. We quickly adapted to remote work and removed barriers for our staff to be able to support and innovate for our restaurants from any workplace. We continue to invest in initiatives that provide secure and efficient operations, enhance the guest experience and provide benchmarks that allow us to evaluate our operational metrics and demise disparate systems. 
 We utilize industry-leading service providers and cloud services to streamline processes at both the restaurant and support center. Interfaces between point-of-sale, labor management, inventory management, menu management, digital platforms and financial systems are the foundation of our enterprise analytics platform. This approach has laid the groundwork to allow our infrastructure to become much more scalable, as we also continue to implement and support solutions to capitalize on current digital market trends to drive sales and realize operational efficiency.
Trademarks
Our company has registered various trademarks, makes use of various unregistered marks, and intends to vigorously defend these marks. We highly value our trademarks, trade names and service marks and will defend against any improper use of its marks to the fullest extent allowable by law.
Franchise Program
Our goals continue to be a valued franchisor, to enhance communication and recognition of best practices throughout the system and to continue to expand our franchisee network domestically and internationally. Our growth and success depend in part upon our ability to attract, contract with and retain qualified franchisees. It also depends upon the ability of those franchisees to successfully operate their restaurants with our standards of quality and promote and develop both the Village Inn and Famous Dave’s brand awareness. 
 Although we have established criteria to evaluate prospective franchisees, and our franchise agreements include certain operating standards, each franchisee operates his or her restaurants independently. Various laws limit our ability to influence the day-to-day operation of our franchise restaurants. We cannot assure you that the franchisees will 

12



be able to successfully operate Village Inn and Famous Dave’s restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards for operational excellence, service and food quality.
As of January 2, 2022, we had 49 ownership groups with franchise-operated restaurants in the following locations:

Our franchise operations department is led by our director of franchise operations for each respective brand. They guide the efforts of our franchise business consultants. The director of franchise operations and the franchise business consultants have the responsibility of supporting our franchisees throughout the system. The director of franchise operations and the franchise business consultants manage the relationship between us and our franchisees and provide an understanding of the roles, responsibilities, differences, and accountabilities of that relationship. They are active participants towards enhancing performance, as they partner in strategic and operations planning sessions with our 

13



franchise partners and review the individual strategies and tactics for obtaining superior performance for the franchisee. They ensure compliance with obligations under our area development and franchise agreements. Franchisees are encouraged to utilize all available assistance from the franchise business consultants and the support center but are not required to do so. 
We have a comprehensive operations scorecard and training tool that helps us measure the operational effectiveness of our franchise-operated restaurants. This scorecard is used to evaluate, monitor and improve operations in areas such as guest satisfaction, health and safety standards, community involvement, and local store marketing effectiveness, among other operating metrics. Also, we generally provide support as it relates to all aspects of franchise operations including store openings and operating performance. Finally, we solicit feedback from our franchise system by having an active dialogue with all franchisees throughout the year. 
The franchisee’s investment for both Village Inn and Famous Dave’s depends primarily upon restaurant size. This investment includes the area development fee, initial franchise fee, real estate and leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment, point-of-sale systems, business licenses, deposits, initial food inventory, small-wares, décor and training fees as well as working capital. In fiscal year 2021, certain franchisees were required to contribute 1.0% of net sales to a marketing fund dedicated to providing digital and creative services. Currently, franchisees are required to spend approximately 1.5% of their net sales annually on local marketing activities.
Seasonality
Our Famous Dave’s restaurants typically generate higher revenue in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year as a result of seasonal traffic increases and high catering sales experienced during the summer months. Our Granite City restaurants typically generate higher revenue in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year as a result of warmer weather and increased patio seating in the second quarter and holiday activity in the fourth quarter. Our Village Inn and Bakers Square restaurants typically generate higher sales and revenue during the holiday season between Thanksgiving and New Year's due to the high volumes of holiday pie sales during that time. 
Government Regulation
Our company is subject to extensive state and local government regulation by various governmental agencies, including state and local licensing, zoning, land use, construction and environmental regulations and various regulations relating to the sale of food and alcoholic beverages, sanitation, disposal of refuse and waste products, public health, safety and fire standards. Our restaurants are subject to periodic inspections by governmental agencies to ensure conformity with such regulations. Any difficulty or failure to obtain required licensing or other regulatory approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant, and the suspension of, or inability to renew a license, could interrupt operations at an existing restaurant, any of which would adversely affect our operations. Restaurant operating costs are also affected by other government actions that are beyond our control, including increases in minimum hourly wage requirements, worker’s compensation insurance rates, health care insurance costs, property and casualty insurance, and unemployment and other taxes. We are also subject to “dram-shop” statutes, which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. We are also subject to extensive state and federal government regulation by various governmental agencies due to our digital and social media footprint in the collection of customer’s or potential customer’s data. This includes data storage and privacy laws on a state and federal basis. 
As a franchisor, we are subject to federal regulation and certain state laws that govern the offer and sale of franchises. Many state franchise laws impose substantive requirements on franchise agreements, including limitations on non-competition provisions and the termination or non-renewal of a franchise. Bills have been introduced in Congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. As proposed, such legislation would limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-competition provisions, the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise, and the ability of a franchisor to designate sources of supply. 
The 1990 Federal Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment. We have in the past and could in the future be required to incur costs to modify our restaurants in order to provide service to, or make reasonable accommodations for, disabled persons. Our restaurants are 

14



currently designed to be accessible to the disabled, and we believe we are in substantial compliance with all current applicable regulations relating to this Act.
Team Members
As of January 2, 2022, we employed approximately 4,350 team members of which approximately 397 were salaried full-time employees. None of our team members are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
