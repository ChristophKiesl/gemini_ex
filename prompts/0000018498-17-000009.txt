Manufacturing and Sourcing
The Company relies on independent third-party manufacturers for production of its footwear products sold at wholesale. The Company sources footwear and accessory products from foreign manufacturers located in Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, China, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Italy, Mexico, Pakistan, Portugal, Peru, Romania, Taiwan, Tunisia and Vietnam. The Company’s retail operations sell primarily branded products from third parties who source primarily overseas.
Competition
Competition is intense in the footwear, headwear, sports apparel and accessory industries. The Company’s retail footwear, headwear, sports apparel and accessory competitors range from small, locally owned stores to regional and national department stores, discount stores, specialty chains and online retailers. The Company also competes with hundreds of footwear wholesale operations in the United States and throughout the world, most of which are relatively small, specialized operations, but some of which are large, more diversified companies. Some of the Company’s competitors have resources that are not available to the Company. The Company’s success depends upon its ability to remain competitive with respect to the key factors of style, price, quality, comfort, brand loyalty, customer service, store location and atmosphere, technology, infrastructure and speed of delivery to support e-commerce and the ability to offer distinctive products.
Licenses
The Company owns its Johnston & Murphy® and H.S. Trask® brands and owns or licenses the trade names of its retail concepts either directly or through wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Dockers® footwear line, introduced in Fiscal 1993, is sold under a license agreement granting the Company the exclusive right to sell men’s footwear under the trademark in the United States, Canada and Mexico and in certain other Latin American countries. The Dockers license agreement's current term expires on November 30, 2018. Net sales of Dockers products were approximately $67 million in Fiscal 2017 and approximately $78 million in Fiscal 2016. The Company licenses certain of its footwear brands, mostly in foreign markets. License royalty income was not material in Fiscal 2017.
Wholesale Backlog
Most of the orders in the Company’s wholesale divisions are for delivery within 150 days. Because most of the Company’s business is at-once, the backlog at any one time is not necessarily indicative of future sales. As of February 25, 2017, the Company’s wholesale operations had a backlog of orders, including unconfirmed customer purchase orders, amounting to approximately $34.9 million, compared to approximately $32.8 million on February 27, 2016. The backlog is somewhat seasonal, reaching a peak in the spring. The Company maintains in-stock programs for selected product lines with anticipated high volume sales.
Employees
Genesco had approximately 27,200 employees at January 28, 2017, approximately 150 of whom were employed in corporate staff departments and the balance in operations. Retail stores employ a substantial number of part-time employees, and approximately 19,775 of the Company’s employees were part-time at January 28, 2017.
Seasonality
The Company's business is seasonal with the Company's investment in inventory and accounts receivable normally reaching peaks in the spring and fall of each year and a significant portion of the Company's net sales and operating earnings generated during the fourth quarter.
Properties
At January 28, 2017, the Company operated 2,794 retail footwear, headwear and sports apparel and accessory stores and leased departments throughout the United States and in Puerto Rico, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and Germany. New shopping center store leases in the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada typically are for a term of approximately 10 years. New store leases in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and Germany typically have terms of between 10 and 20 years. Both typically provide for rent based on a percentage of sales against a fixed minimum rent based on the square footage leased.

Environmental Matters
The Company’s former manufacturing operations and the sites of those operations as well as the sites of its current operations are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to human health and safety and the environment. These laws and regulations address and regulate, among other matters, wastewater discharge, air quality and the generation, handling, storage, treatment, disposal, and transportation of solid and hazardous wastes and releases of hazardous substances into the environment. In addition, third parties and governmental agencies in some cases have the power under such laws and regulations to require remediation of environmental conditions and, in the case of governmental agencies, to impose fines and penalties. Several of the facilities owned by the Company (currently or in the past) are located in industrial areas and have historically been used for extensive periods for industrial operations such as tanning, dyeing, and manufacturing. Some of these operations used materials and generated wastes that would be considered regulated substances under current environmental laws and regulations. The Company currently is involved in certain administrative and judicial environmental proceedings relating to the Company’s former facilities. See Item 3, "Legal Proceedings" and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data".
