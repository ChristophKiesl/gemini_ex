Company Background and Strategy
Rogers Corporation designs, develops, manufactures and sells high-performance and high-reliability engineered materials and components to meet our customers’ demanding challenges. We operate three strategic operating segments: Advanced Connectivity Solutions (ACS), Elastomeric Material Solutions (EMS) and Power Electronics Solutions (PES). The remaining operations, which represent our non-core businesses, are reported in the Other operating segment. We have a history of innovation and have established Innovation Centers for our research and development (R&D) activities in Chandler, Arizona; Burlington, Massachusetts; Eschenbach, Germany; and Suzhou, China. We are headquartered in Chandler, Arizona.
Our growth strategy is based upon the following principles: (1) market-driven organization, (2) innovation leadership, (3) synergistic mergers and acquisitions, and (4) operational excellence. As a market-driven organization, we are focused on growth drivers, including advanced mobility and advanced connectivity. More specifically, in addition to the impact COVID-19 discussed below, the key medium- to long-term trends currently affecting our business include the increasing use of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and increasing electrification of vehicles, including electric and hybrid electric vehicles (EV/HEV), in the automotive industry and the growth of 5G smartphones in the portable electronics industry. In addition to our focus on advanced mobility and advanced connectivity in the automotive, portable electronics and telecommunications industries, we sell into a variety of other markets including general industrial, aerospace and defense, mass transit, renewable energy and connected devices.
Our sales and marketing approach is based on addressing these trends, while our strategy focuses on factors for success as a manufacturer of engineered materials and components: performance, quality, service, cost, efficiency, innovation and technology. We have expanded our capabilities through organic investment and acquisitions and strive to ensure high quality solutions for our customers. We continue to review and re-align our manufacturing and engineering footprint in an effort to maintain a leading competitive position globally. We have established or expanded our capabilities in various locations in support of our customers’ growth initiatives.
We seek to enhance our operational and financial performance by investing in research and development, manufacturing and materials efficiencies, and new product initiatives that respond to the needs of our customers. We strive to evaluate operational and strategic alternatives to improve our business structure and align our business with the changing needs of our customers and major industry trends affecting our business.
COVID-19 Update
The global COVID-19 pandemic has affected and continues to affect Rogers’ business and operations, although to a lesser extent than the first half of 2020. In response to the outbreak, Rogers prioritized the safety and well-being of its employees—including implementing social distancing initiatives in its facilities, providing remote working arrangements for certain employees, expanding personal protective equipment usage, enhancing plant hygiene processes, and extending employee benefits, which increased our expenses in 2020—while at the same time taking actions to preserve business continuity. Our non-manufacturing employees transitioned seamlessly to remote working arrangements and are maintaining effective collaboration, both internally and with our customers. In some cases, based on local conditions, non-manufacturing employees have returned to their worksites.
Our China business and operations were the first to be impacted by the virus, with the government temporarily suspending our operations, as well as the operations of most Chinese business, including our Chinese customers and suppliers, at the beginning of February. We resumed production in mid-February and reached full production capacity by early-March.
Our U.S. and European businesses were first impacted later in the first quarter, and the impact continued through the rest of the fiscal year and through the date of this filing. In both the U.S. and Europe, we generally maintained operations at close to normal levels, with the additional employee safety precautions implemented at our facilities. We do not believe these additional precautions, in the aggregate, had a material impact on our financial performance in 2020. In the U.S., exemptions from state-level “shelter in place” directives with respect to numerous sectors, including the Communications, Healthcare and Public Health, Defense Industrial Base, Critical Manufacturing and Information Technology sectors, have largely enabled us to continue our operations while those directives were in place through the date of this filing.
Our operations were not affected by any material shortages, as our inventory and supply chain met our manufacturing requirements. Global demand continued to be impacted in the fourth quarter by the COVID-19 pandemic, although to a lesser extent than prior quarters. General industrial and mass transit market demand continued to be the most impacted. Demand improved in some markets in the second half of 2020, such as portable electronics, EV/HEV, aerospace and defense and automotive relative to the first half of 2020. We expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will have a continuing but uncertain impact on our business and operations in the short- and medium-term.
Operating Segments
Advanced Connectivity Solutions
Our ACS operating segment designs, develops, manufactures and sells circuit materials and solutions enabling high-performance and high-reliability connectivity for applications in wireless infrastructure (e.g., power amplifiers, antennas and small cells), automotive (e.g., ADAS, telematics and thermal solutions), aerospace and defense (e.g. antenna systems, communication systems and phased array radar systems), connected devices (e.g., mobile internet devices and thermal solutions) and wired infrastructure (e.g., computing and IP infrastructure) markets. We believe these products have characteristics that offer performance and other functional advantages in many market applications that serve to differentiate our products from other commonly available materials. ACS products are sold principally to independent and captive printed circuit board fabricators that convert our laminates to custom printed circuits. Trade names for our ACS products include: RO4000® Series, RO3000® Series, RT/duroid®, CLTE Series®, TMM®, AD Series®, DiClad® Series, CuClad® Series, Kappa®, COOLSPAN®, TC Series®, 92ML™, IsoClad® Series, MAGTREX™, XTremeSpeed RO1200™ Laminates, IM Series™, 2929 Bondply, 3001 Bondply Film and SpeedWave™ Prepreg. As of December 31, 2020, our ACS operating segment had manufacturing and administrative facilities in Chandler, Arizona; Rogers, Connecticut; Bear, Delaware; Evergem, Belgium; and Suzhou, China.
Elastomeric Material Solutions
Our EMS operating segment designs, develops, manufactures and sells engineered material solutions for a wide variety of applications and markets. These include polyurethane and silicone materials used in cushioning, gasketing and sealing, and vibration management applications for general industrial, portable electronics, automotive, mass transit, aerospace and defense, footwear and impact mitigation and printing markets; customized silicones used in flex heater and semiconductor thermal applications for general industrial, portable electronics, automotive, mass transit, aerospace and defense and medical markets; polytetrafluoroethylene and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene materials used in wire and cable protection, electrical insulation, conduction and shielding, hose and belt protection, vibration management, cushioning, gasketing and sealing, and venting applications for general industrial, automotive and aerospace and defense markets. We believe these materials have characteristics that offer functional advantages in many market applications which serve to differentiate Rogers’ products from other commonly available materials. EMS products are sold globally to converters, fabricators, distributors and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Trade names for our EMS products include: PORON®, BISCO®, DeWAL®, ARLON®, eSorba®, Griswold®, XRD®, R/bak® and HeatSORB™.
As of December 31, 2020, our EMS operating segment had administrative and manufacturing facilities in Moosup, Connecticut; Rogers, Connecticut; Woodstock, Connecticut; Bear, Delaware; Carol Stream, Illinois; Narragansett, Rhode Island; Ansan, South Korea; and Suzhou, China. We also own 50% of two unconsolidated joint ventures: (1) Rogers Inoac Corporation (RIC), a joint venture established in Japan to design, develop, manufacture and sell PORON® products predominantly for the Japanese market and (2) Rogers INOAC Suzhou Corporation (RIS), a joint venture established in China to design, develop, manufacture and sell PORON® products primarily for RIC customers in various Asian countries. INOAC Corporation owns the remaining 50% of both RIC and RIS. RIC has manufacturing facilities at the INOAC facilities in Nagoya and Mie, Japan, and RIS has manufacturing facilities at Rogers’ facilities in Suzhou, China.
Power Electronics Solutions
Our PES operating segment designs, develops, manufactures and sells ceramic substrate materials, busbars and cooling solutions for a variety of applications in EV/HEV, general industrial, mass transit, renewable energy, aerospace and defense and wired infrastructure markets. We sell our ceramic substrate materials and cooling solutions under the curamik® trade name and our busbars under the ROLINX® trade name. As of December 31, 2020, our PES operating segment had manufacturing and administrative facilities in Evergem, Belgium; Eschenbach, Germany; Budapest, Hungary; and Suzhou, China.
Other
Our Other operating segment consists of elastomer components for applications in general industrial market, as well as elastomer floats for level sensing in fuel tanks, motors, and storage tanks applications in the general industrial and automotive markets. We sell our elastomer components under our ENDUR® trade name and our floats under our NITROPHYL® trade name.
Sales and Competition
We sell our materials and components primarily through direct sales channels positioned near major concentrations of our customers in North America, Europe and Asia. We sold to approximately 3,600 customers worldwide in 2020, primarily OEMs and component suppliers. No individual customer represented more than 10% of our total net sales for 2020; however, there are concentrations of OEM customers in our ACS (Chinese telecommunications equipment manufacturers) and PES (semiconductor and automotive manufacturers) operating segments. Although the loss of any one of our larger customers would 
require a period of adjustment, during which the results of operations could be materially adversely impacted, we believe that such events could be successfully mitigated over a period of time due to the diversity of our customer base.
We employ a technical sales and marketing approach pursuant to which we work collaboratively to provide design engineering, testing, product development and other technical support services to OEMs that incorporate our engineered materials and components in their products. Component suppliers convert, modify or otherwise incorporate our engineered materials and components into their components for these OEMs in accordance with their specifications. Accordingly, we provide similar technical support services to component suppliers.
We compete primarily with manufacturers of high-end materials, some of which are large, multi-national companies, principally on the basis of innovation, historical customer relationships, product quality, reliability, performance and price, technical and engineering service and support, breadth of product line, and manufacturing capabilities. We also compete with manufacturers of commodity materials, including smaller regional producers with lower overhead costs and profit requirements located in Asia that attempt to upsell their products based principally upon price, particularly for products that have matured in their life cycle. We believe that we have a competitive advantage because of our reputation for innovation, the performance, quality and reliability of our materials and components, and our commitment to technical support and customer service.
Research and Development
We have a history of innovation, and innovation leadership is a key component of our overall business strategy. The markets we serve are typically characterized by rapid technological changes and advances. Accordingly, the success of our strategy is in part dependent on our ability to develop market-leading products, which is primarily driven by efforts in R&D. We are focused on identifying technologies and innovations related to both our current product portfolio as well as initiatives targeted at further diversifying and growing our business. As part of this technology commitment, we have a Rogers Innovation Center co-located at Northeastern University in Burlington, Massachusetts, as well as Rogers Innovation Centers at our facilities in Chandler, Arizona, Eschenbach, Germany and Suzhou, China. Our Innovation Centers focus on early stages of technical and commercial development of new high-tech materials solutions in an effort to align with market direction and needs.
Patents and Other Intellectual Property
We have many domestic and foreign patents, licenses and additional patent applications pending related to technology in each of our operating segments. These patents and licenses vary in duration and provide some protection from competition. We also own a number of registered and unregistered trademarks and have acquired and developed certain confidential and proprietary technologies, including trade secrets that we believe to be of some importance to our business.
While we believe our patents and other intellectual property provide a competitive advantage to our operating segments, we believe that a significant part of our competitive position and future success will be determined by factors such as the innovative skills, systems and process knowledge, and technological expertise of our personnel; the range of new products we develop; and our customer service and support.
Manufacturing and Raw Materials
The key raw materials used in our business are as follows: for our ACS operating segment, copper, polymer, polytetraflouroethylene and fiberglass materials; for our EMS operating segment, polyol, isocyanates, polytetraflouroethylene, ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene materials, silicone and natural rubber materials; and for our PES operating segment, copper, ceramic and brazing paste materials, including silver.
Some of the raw materials used in our business are available through sole or limited-source suppliers. While we have undertaken strategies to mitigate the risks associated with sole or limited source suppliers, these strategies may not be effective in all cases, and price increases or disruptions in our supply of raw materials could have a material adverse impact on our business. For additional information, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Seasonality
Except for some minor seasonality for consumer products, which often aligns with year-end holidays and product launch cycles, the operations of our segments have not been seasonal.
Human Capital Management
The Company’s continuing success derives from our talented and dedicated employees globally, who are responsible for the innovation, operations and ethics foundational to our business and its future. In 2020, our employees navigated the challenges from COVID-19, and, with an overarching commitment to health and safety, maintained a steady flow of materials for our customers, including for critical infrastructure and health applications.
As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 3,350 people, of whom approximately 1,250 were employed in the U.S., 1,150 in Europe and 950 in China. Approximately 375 of our domestic employees are covered by collective bargaining 
agreements or by specific labor agreements and approximately 750 of our European employees are covered by work council arrangements.
Our approach to human capital management is based on our culture of respect, which is built on the ethical foundation of our Code of Business Ethics and our commitment to making choices that are based on what is ethically sound and not just what is easy or expedient. Additionally, we connect our day-to-day work with our organizational objectives through our Cultural Behaviors: Live Safely, Trust, Just Decide, Speak Openly, Simply Improve, Innovate and Deliver Results. Management’s principal objectives, with oversight from our Board of Directors, are Health and Safety, Employee Experience and Diversity and Inclusion.
Health and Safety
The health and safety of our employees is a paramount objective. We strive to minimize lost workdays and recordable incidents. To promote awareness and accountability, safety performance data is shared throughout the company and executive compensation includes safety performance factors.
Employment Experience
We take a comprehensive approach to the employment experience, striving to use a fair and inclusive recruiting process to select talented individuals. Once we hire, we endeavor to provide our employees a safe and ethical work environment that includes fair compensation, opportunities for career development and employee engagement. We are proud to invest in our employees’ futures through a variety of technical and other training opportunities internally, as well as education reimbursement programs globally.
Diversity and Inclusion
We continue to advance efforts to improve diversity and inclusion within the Company, focusing on attracting and maintaining diverse talent within the organization and promoting awareness and acceptance globally. We believe that our diversity and inclusion will make the Company a more desirable workplace and will lead to improved business performance.
Backlog
Our sales are generally pursuant to short-term purchase orders. These purchase orders are made without deposits and may be rescheduled, canceled or modified on relatively short notice, without substantial penalty. Therefore, even though we may have a large backlog from time to time, we believe the purchase orders or backlog are not necessarily a reliable indicator of future sales.
