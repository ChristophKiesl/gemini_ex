Item 1. Business 
Introduction 
 We are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on May 4, 2020 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the Initial Business Combination). 
 Our Sponsor is advised by Pershing Square Capital Management, L.P. (Pershing Square or PSCM), a registered investment adviser under the Investment Act of 1940, as amended, and the members of our Sponsor are the Pershing Square Funds. 
 Our management team is led by William A. Ackman, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who works closely with the PSCM investment team and the other employees of, and resources available to, PSCM to fulfill our corporate mission. Mr. Ackman has spent 29 years in the investment management industry, the last 18 years as CEO of PSCM. PSCMs investment strategy involves the purchase of large minority stakes in high-quality, large capitalization, growth companies during periods when they have underperformed their potential. By working with management teams and boards of directors, PSCM has assisted its portfolio companies in creating substantial long-term value. 
 The Pershing Square investment team is comprised of seven investment professionals with tenures at Pershing Square of 4 to 17 years, who prior to Pershing Square, served in analyst and associate roles at Apollo, Blackstone, KKR, Goldman Sachs, and Hellman & Friedman. PSCM has 32 other accounting, legal, finance, technology, and administrative professionals who support our company on an as-needed basis. 
 We believe that we have substantial competitive advantages when compared with other blank check companies and other sources of equity capital, such as private equity, growth equity and hedge funds, among others. We have these competitive advantages because of the amount of committed capital we have, our willingness to acquire a minority stake, our ability to give a private company access to the public equity markets and the lower cost of capital of our structure compared to other blank check companies. 
 We have the largest amount of committed capital of any blank check company. As a result of our initial public offering and the Committed Forward Purchase Units, we have a minimum of $5,000,000,000 in equity capital for use in our Initial Business Combination (assuming that the Additional Forward Purchase is not consummated and assuming no redemptions of the Class A Common Stock), and as much as $7,000,000,000 (assuming the Additional Forward Purchase is consummated in full and assuming no redemptions of the Class A Common Stock), in each case, before expenses and not including the $6,000,000 of Forward Purchase Units certain of our directors have agreed to purchase. 
 We intend to merge with one company through a transaction in which our stockholders (just prior to the Initial Business Combination) will own a minority interest in the company that is created as a result of the Initial Business Combination. We believe that a substantial majority of other investors in private companies are not prepared to (or are not able to) deploy $5,000,000,000 or more of cash in the acquisition of a minority interest in a company. While comparably sized or larger investment funds generally seek to acquire controlling or 100% interests in one company, we are willing to execute a transaction in which our stockholders will own a minority stake in a large-capitalization private company. As a result, we believe we will be one of the largest sources of cash equity capital for a private, single-company, minority investment in the world. 
 As the largest blank check company currently pursuing a business combination, we can offer a larger-capitalization private company (with market capitalization of $10,000,000,000 or more) the opportunity to gain access to the public equity markets, without the company having to conduct its own initial public offering (IPO). Through a merger, we will be, in effect, facilitating the IPO of a large private company, enabling a private business to avoid the inherent costs and risks associated with the traditional IPO process. 
 We intend to pursue merger opportunities with private, large capitalization, high-quality, growth companies. We will use PSCMs substantial experience in identifying, analyzing, and determining business quality and the sustainable competitive advantages of a target company, as well as PSCMs due diligence and negotiation expertise in executing a transaction. 
 Nearly eight months since our launch, based on our experience and progress to date, we continue to believe an investment in our Company will generate highly attractive long-term returns. 
 
5 


 The past experiences and performances of the members of our management team is not a guarantee (i) that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our Initial Business Combination or (ii) that we will provide an attractive return to our stockholders from any business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of PSCM, the Pershing Square Funds and our managements performance as indicative of our future performance. 
 Our Business Strategy 
 Our business strategy is to identify and complete a business combination that creates substantial long-term value for our stockholders. We are seeking target companies that demonstrate the characteristics set out under Our Acquisition Criteria below. We believe our investment teams operational, financial and transaction experience across economic cycles and our broad network of relationships, along with our deep understanding of the equity and debt capital markets, allow us to effectively and efficiently identify and evaluate potential opportunities for our Initial Business Combination. 
 We are considering companies in a wide range of industries, but generally seek to acquire a simple, high-quality, high-return on capital business that generates predictable growing cash flows that can be estimated within a reasonable range over the long term. We prefer targets that have low sensitivity to macroeconomic factors, with minimal commodity exposure and/or cyclical risk. We are willing to accept a high degree of situational, legal, and/or capital structure complexity in a business combination if we believe that the potential for reward justifies this additional complexity, particularly if these issues can be resolved in connection with and as a result of a combination with us. 
 To achieve a successful Initial Business Combination, our investment team will leverage its experience to identify a company with a strong competitive position that can benefit from being a public company in the execution of its growth and value-creation strategy. We believe our scale and structure, coupled with our investment teams background and experience, make us an attractive partner for high-quality management teams and owners. 
 Our Acquisition Criteria 
 Consistent with our core investment principles and business strategy, we are seeking to enter into an Initial Business Company with a company which has characteristics that we have outlined below. We use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to complete our Initial Business Combination with a target business that does not meet all of these criteria. We are seeking to acquire a company that has the following characteristics: 

 | Simple, predictable, and free-cash-flow-generative. We are generally seeking a company with a proven track record of growth and free cash flow generation, and predictable future financial performance that we expect will generate strong, sustainable growth in cash flows over the long termhowever, we are open to considering a company that may, at the time of the Initial Business Combination, be cash-flow negative, if we believe that the businesss cash flow will become positive within a reasonable amount of time;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Formidable barriers to entry. We are seeking a company that has long-term sustainable competitive advantages, significant barriers to entry, or wide moats around their business, with low risks of disruption due to competition, innovation or new entrants;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Limited exposure to extrinsic factors that we cannot control. We are seeking a company that is not materially affected by macroeconomic factors, commodity prices, regulatory risks, interest rate volatility and/or cyclical risk;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Strong balance sheet. We are seeking a company that is conservatively financed relative to its free cash-flow generation, after taking into consideration the de-leveraging effects of the Initial Business Combination;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Minimal capital markets dependency. We are seeking a company that can benefit from being a public company with broader access to the capital markets and greater governance, but prefer a company that is not highly reliant on the capital markets to operate and grow its businesses;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Large capitalization. We are seeking a company with a large enterprise value and significant long-term growth potential that is a likely candidate for inclusion in the S&P 500 index;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Attractive valuation. We are seeking a company at an attractive valuation relative to its long-term intrinsic value; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Exceptional management and governance. We are seeking a company that has a trustworthy, talented, experienced, and highly competent management team. The company may be led by an entrepreneur who is looking for a partner with our expertise to execute on the next stage of the companys growth. For target companies that require new management, we will leverage PSCMs experience in identifying and recruiting new management.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular Initial Business Combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines, as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management and our investment team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our Initial Business Combination with a target 
 
6 


  business that does not substantially meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not substantially meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our Initial Business Combination, in the form of tender offer documents or proxy materials that we would file with the SEC. 
 Our Acquisition Process 
 In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a detailed due diligence review of the issues that we deem important in order to determine a companys business quality and estimate its intrinsic value. That due diligence review will include, among other things, financial statement analysis, detailed document reviews, meetings with incumbent management and employees, consultations with relevant industry experts, competitors, customers and suppliers, as well as a review of additional financial, legal and other information that we will seek to obtain as part of our analysis of a target company. 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an Initial Business Combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our Initial Business Combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA) or an independent accounting firm that our Initial Business Combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. 
 Each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors is included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our Initial Business Combination. 
 Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our Initial Business Combination. In addition, we have an investment team comprised of seven members, who are employed by PSCM. We believe our investment team members are able to allocate their duties to us and to PSCM amongst themselves in a manner that allows them to provide us with the resources and support we require while fulfilling their responsibilities to PSCM. The amount of time that any such person devotes in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our Initial Business Combination and the current stage of the business combination process. 
 Although PSCM is the investment adviser to the Pershing Square Funds, we do not believe that PSCMs activities present significant conflicts of interest with respect to our pursuit of an acquisition target, because we intend that our acquisition target will be a privately owned company, and the Pershing Square Funds are not permitted by their constituent documents to make investments in the equities of companies whose securities are not publicly traded (except that they may make investments in public companies that issue private securities). 
 PSCM and its affiliates may form and manage other investment vehicles investing in public companies at any time prior to the announcement of our Initial Business Combination, including, but not limited to, investment vehicles that may invest side-by-side with our company. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue. Neither the affiliates of our Sponsor nor members of our management team who are employed by our Sponsor or its affiliates have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware. However, absent a significant conflict of interest with respect to our pursuit of an acquisition target, we would expect such opportunity to be provided to us, as such potential target company would be a private company. 
 Each of our directors and officers currently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities (including current or future investment vehicles of our Sponsor) pursuant to which such director or officer is or will be required to present business combination opportunities to such entity. Therefore, our directors and officers may be required to present potential business combinations to the related entities described above before they present such opportunities to us. Accordingly, in the future, if any of our directors or officers becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor these obligations to present such opportunity to such entity first, and only present it to us if such entities reject the opportunity and he or she determines to present the opportunity to us. Any presentation of such opportunities to entities other than us, or affiliates of our Sponsor, may present additional conflicts. 
 
7 


 Although the current and future fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our directors or officers could materially undermine our ability to complete our business combination, we believe this risk is partly mitigated for the following reasons. As stated above, our Sponsor and its affiliates currently do not make, or are not permitted to make, investments in private companies. Further, each of our directors and officers has agreed not to become a director or officer of any other special purpose acquisition company with a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act, until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our Initial Business Combination or we have failed to complete our Initial Business Combination within 24 months (or 30 months from the closing of the initial public offering if we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for our Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the initial public offering, but have not completed our Initial Business Combination within such 24-month period) of the closing of the initial public offering (the Combination Period). With respect to a potential business combination as to which a director may be interested or have a potential conflict of interest, we may take steps including, but not limited to, requiring the review of our audit committee pursuant to our related party policy, the recusal of such director with respect to such transaction, the appointment of a committee of independent and disinterested directors, or, as described above, the use of an independent accounting firm to ensure that a potential business combination is fair to our stockholders. 
 Initial Business Combination 
 So long as we maintain a listing for our securities on the NYSE, our Initial Business Combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount held in trust) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our Initial Business Combination. If our securities are no longer listed on the NYSE, we will not be obligated to satisfy such 80% test. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or the value of comparable businesses. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of a target business or businesses, it may be unable to do so if the board is less familiar or experienced with the target companys business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the companys assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value of the target business meets the 80% of assets threshold, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a target business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our stockholders. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to stockholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed transaction will include such opinion. 
 We anticipate structuring our Initial Business Combination so that our stockholders (including our Sponsor, the Forward Purchasers, directors, officers and our Public Stockholders) will own a minority stake in the post-combination business, which post-combination business we anticipate will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our Initial Business Combination such that the post-combination business owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business for the post-combination business to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-combination business owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires an interest in the target or assets sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-combination business, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the Initial Business Combination for the purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable. 
 Effect of Sponsor Warrants and Director Warrants on Ownership 
 The unique structure of our Sponsor Warrants and Director Warrants, which provide our Sponsor and directors with a fixed percentage of the pro forma post-combination business immediately after the Initial Business Combination, will have different effects on the ownership interest of our Public Stockholders in the post-combination business as compared to the typical structure of blank check companies, in which the Sponsor maintains a fixed 20% interest in the pre-combination business. Specifically, the dilutive effect of the Sponsor Warrants and Director Warrants depends on the price of the post-combination businesss common shares at the time of exercise (the Market Price), and only exists to the extent the Market Price exceeds the exercise price. 
 Though the number of shares issuable to the holders of the Sponsor Warrants and Director Warrants (for the purposes of this discussion, the Private Holders) is calculated as approximately 6.21% of the fully-diluted common shares outstanding immediately following the Initial Business Combination, the actual ownership stake of the Private Holders in the post-combination business upon 
 
8 


  the exercise of all warrants will differ significantly. At or below the $24.00 exercise price of the Sponsor Warrants and Director Warrants, the Private Holders will not have any ownership stake. Accordingly, there will be no dilutive effect on the Public Stockholders and the holders of the Redeemable Warrants (for the purposes of this discussion, the Public Holders). At higher Market Prices, the ownership stake (and overall dilutive effect) of the Private Holders increases towards its limit of approximately 6.21%. 
 The following table presents the dilutive effect of the Sponsor Warrants and Director Warrants as (i) the change in the Public Holders ownership stake with and without taking into account the Sponsor Warrants and Directors Warrants, as a percentage of (ii) the Public Holders ownership stake if the Sponsor Warrants and Director Warrants did not exist. The dilutive effect is shown across a range of transaction sizes and Market Prices at the time of the Initial Business Combination. The scenarios below assume no redemptions of Class A Common Stock and that the Forward Purchasers purchase the $1,000,000,000 of Committed Forward Purchase Units (50,000,000 Forward Purchase Units). 
 If the post-combination business equity is valued at $10 billion and the Market Price is $20.00, the $4 billion of value represented by the shares of Class A Common Stock gives the Public Owners an ownership stake of 40.0% in the post-combination business, whether or not the Sponsor Warrants exist (as none of the warrants are exercisable at this Market Price). At a Market Price of $36.00, the Public Owners have an ownership stake of 42.3% (reflecting exercise of their Redeemable Warrants), without taking into account the Sponsor Warrants and Director Warrants. By including the Sponsor Warrants and Director Warrants, their ownership stake decreases to 41.3%. The dilutive effect, calculated as the 1.0% decline in ownership stake, divided by 42.3%, is 2.4%. 
 If the post-combination business equity is valued at $25 billion and the Market Price is $20.00, the $4 billion of value represented by the shares of Class A Common Stock gives the Public Owners an ownership stake of 16.0% in the post-combination business, whether or not the Sponsor Warrants exist (as none of the warrants are exercisable at this Market Price). At a Market Price of $36.00, the Public Owners have an ownership stake of 17.5% (reflecting exercise of their Redeemable Warrants), absent the Private Holders. Including the Private Holders, their ownership stake decreases to 17.1%. The dilutive effect, calculated as the 0.4% decline in ownership stake, divided by 17.5%, is 2.2%. 
 As shown below, the size of the ownership stake of all of our pre-combination stockholders and warrant holders decreases proportionately with a larger deal size. However, the dilutive effect does not vary significantly with deal size. 
 

Dilution from Sponsor and Director Warrants to Public Holders
Share Price of our Class A Common Stock | | Post-Combination Business Equity Value at IBC (in millions)
 | $10,000 | | $15,000 | | $20,000 | $25,000 | $30,000
 | | % Public Holders Equity Ownership Stake at IBC 
 | | | | 40.0% | | | 26.7% | 20.0% | 16.0% | 13.3%
$20.00 | | | |  | | |  |  |  |  
$24.00 | | | |  | | |  |  |  |  
$28.00 | | | | 1.1% | | | 1.0% | 1.0% | 1.0% | 1.0% 
$32.00 | | | | 1.8% | | | 1.8% | 1.7% | 1.7% | 1.7% 
$36.00 | | | | 2.4% | | | 2.3% | 2.3% | 2.2% | 2.2% 

 All warrants are assumed to be exercised by surrendering such warrants for that number of common shares of the post-combination business equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of common shares underlying such warrants, multiplied by the excess of the Market Price over the exercise price of warrants, by (y) the Market Price. 
 Status as a Public Company 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 
9 


 Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following July 24, 2025, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to emerging growth company shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act. 
 Financial Position 
 With proceeds from the initial public offering and the Committed Forward Purchase Units, we will have a minimum of approximately $5,000,000,000 in equity capital (subject to redemptions in the case of the Class A Common Stock offered hereby) for use in our Initial Business Combination (assuming that the additional forward purchase is not consummated and assuming no redemptions of the Class A Common Stock), and as much as $7,000,000,000 (assuming the additional forward purchase is consummated in full and assuming no redemptions of the Class A Common Stock), in each case before the payment of fees and expenses associated with our Initial Business Combination. We believe that we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations and strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt. Because we are able to complete our business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit owners and managements needs and requirements. We have not, however, taken any steps to secure third-party financing, and there can be no assurance it will be available to us. 
Effecting our Initial Business Combination 
 We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations other than pursuing and reviewing potential opportunities for the Initial Business Combination. We intend to effectuate our Initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of the initial public offering and the private placement of the Sponsor Warrants, Director Warrants and the Forward Purchase Units, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our Initial Business Combination. We may seek to complete our Initial Business Combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 
 If our Initial Business Combination is paid for using equity or debt instruments, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of our shares of Class A Common Stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-combination business, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our Initial Business Combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or make other investments, or for working capital. 
 In addition to the Forward Purchase Units, we may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our Initial Business Combination, and we may effectuate our Initial Business Combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. In the case of our Initial Business Combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately, or through loans in connection with our Initial Business Combination. At this time, other than the Forward Purchase Agreement, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise. 
 Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination 
 We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our Initial Business Combination. Our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, subject to the 80% NYSE asset test. However, we will not be permitted to effectuate our Initial Business Combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. 
 In any case, we will only complete an Initial Business Combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire an interest in the target sufficient for the post-combination business not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-combination business is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. There is no basis for our investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our business combination. 
 
10 


 To the extent we effect our business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. 
 The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our Initial Business Combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. See Risk Factors  Any current work on a potential Initial Business Combination does not guarantee an immediate or timely deal announcement. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete a business combination. 
 Lack of Business Diversification 
 For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our Initial Business Combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. By completing our Initial Business Combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 

 | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our Initial Business Combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Targets Management Team 
 Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our Initial Business Combination with that business, our assessment of the target business management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our Initial Business Combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. 
 We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our Initial Business Combination. 
 Following our Initial Business Combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. 
 Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination 
 We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of Initial Business Combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction. 

Type of Transaction | Whether Stockholder Approval is Required
Purchase of assets | No 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company | No

Permitted Purchases of Our Securities 
 In the event we seek stockholder approval of our business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our Initial Business Combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions, and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. In addition, the Forward Purchasers may exercise their right under the Forward Purchase Agreement to acquire the Forward Purchase Securities prior to or simultaneously with our Initial Business Combination. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase our securities in such transactions. Our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates will not make any such purchases in privately negotiated transaction or in the open market when they are in possession of any material non-public information unless and until such information is disclosed to the seller in a private transaction or to the market in the case of an open market purchase, or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. 
 In the event that our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from Public Stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. 
 The purpose of such purchases would be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the completion of our business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. 
 In addition, if such purchases are made, the public float of our Class A Common Stock or Redeemable Warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 
 Our Sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our Sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our Initial Business Combination. To the extent that our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors and/or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro-rata share of the trust account or vote against the business combination. Our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors and/or their affiliates will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws. 
 Any purchases by our Sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our Sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.

 Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination 
 We will provide our Public Stockholders with the opportunity to have all or a portion of their share of Class A Common Stock redeemed upon the completion of our Initial Business Combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of five business days prior to the consummation of our Initial Business Combination, including any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then-outstanding Public Shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account as of the closing of the initial public offering was $20.00 per Public Share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our Sponsor, directors, officers and Forward Purchasers have entered into a letter agreement (the Letter Agreement) with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Public Shares held by them in connection with the completion of our business combination. 
Distribution of Distributable Tontine Redeemable Warrants to Holders of Class A Common Stock Not Electing Redemption 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that an aggregate of 44,444,444 Distributable Tontine Redeemable Warrants will be distributed, at the Tontine Distribution Time, on a pro-rata basis only to holders of record of the Public Shares that are outstanding after we redeem any Public Shares that the holders thereof have elected to redeem in connection with our Initial Business Combination (the Initial Business Combination Redemption Time). The Tontine Distribution Time will be immediately after the Initial Business Combination Redemption Time and immediately prior to the closing of our Initial Business Combination. 
 Each such remaining Public Share will receive as a dividend that number of Distributable Tontine Redeemable Warrants calculated as the aggregate number of Distributable Tontine Redeemable Warrants (44,444,444 such warrants) divided by the aggregate number of then-outstanding Public Shares (after we have redeemed Public Shares pursuant to the elections of the holders thereof). Accordingly, Public Stockholders who elect to redeem their Public Shares will not receive any Distributable Tontine Redeemable Warrants in respect of such redeemed Public Shares. The contingent right to receive the Distributable Tontine Redeemable Warrants will remain attached to our Public Share, will not be separately transferable, assignable or salable, and will not be evidenced by any form of certificate or instrument. 
 Our Distributable Tontine Redeemable Warrants are otherwise identical to our Distributable Redeemable Warrants, including with respect to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. No fractional Distributable Tontine Redeemable Warrants will be issued, no cash will be paid in lieu of fractional Distributable Tontine Redeemable Warrants and only whole Distributable Tontine Redeemable Warrants will trade. The Distributable Tontine Redeemable Warrants will be fungible with our Distributable Redeemable Warrants and we expect that they will become tradable on the first trading day following their distribution, under the same stock symbol as the Distributable Redeemable Warrants. 
 No Distributable Tontine Redeemable Warrants will be distributed in respect of the Forward Purchase Shares. 
 Manner of Conducting Redemptions 
 We will provide our Public Stockholders with the opportunity to have all or a portion of their Public Shares redeemed upon the completion of our Initial Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. Under NYSE rules, asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval, while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. If we structure a business combination transaction with a target company in a manner that requires stockholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a stockholder vote to approve the proposed business combination. We intend to conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirements or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. So long as we maintain a listing for our securities on the NYSE, we will be required to comply with such rules. 
 If a stockholder vote is not required and we decide not to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: 
 

 | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our Initial Business Combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about our Initial Business Combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our Initial Business Combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on Public Stockholders not 
 
13 


  tendering more than a specified number of our Public Shares which are not purchased by our Sponsor, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem such shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our Initial Business Combination (so that we are not subject to the SECs penny stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our Initial Business Combination. If Public Stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete our Initial Business Combination. 
 If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: 
 

 | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

 In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our Initial Business Combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our Public Stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of our Initial Business Combination. 
 If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our Initial Business Combination only if a majority of voting power of shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our Sponsor, directors and officers have agreed to vote their shares of common stock in favor of our Initial Business Combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of common stock voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our Initial Business Combination once a quorum is obtained. In addition to the Class B Common Stock held by our Sponsor, we would need 75,000,001, or 37.5%, of the Public Shares to be voted in favor of a transaction in order to have our Initial Business Combination approved, assuming (i) no Forward Purchase Shares have been issued, (ii) the parties to the Letter Agreement have not acquired any Public Shares and (iii) all outstanding shares are voted. We intend to give approximately 30 days (but not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days) prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our Initial Business Combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, our ability to consummate the sale of the Forward Purchase Units prior to a stockholder vote, and the ability of the Forward Purchase Shares to participate in such vote, and the voting provisions of the Letter Agreement, may make it more likely that we will consummate our Initial Business Combination. Each Public Stockholder may elect to redeem its Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem the Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our Initial Business Combination (so that we are not subject to the SECs penny stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our Initial Business Combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners; (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes; or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Public Shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Public Shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. 
 Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination if We Seek Stockholder Approval 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our Initial Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a Public Stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the Public Shares, which we refer to as the Excess Shares, unless our board of directors determines, in its sole discretion, to waive or amend such limit with respect to a particular stockholder or group. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a Public Stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the Public Shares could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holders shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders ability to redeem no more than 15% of the Public Shares (except as otherwise permitted by our board of directors), we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our 
 
14 


  ability to complete our Initial Business Combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not restrict our stockholders ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our business combination. 
 Tendering Stock Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights 
 We may require our Public Stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name, to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Companys DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holders option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to our Public Stockholders in connection with our Initial Business Combination will indicate whether we are requiring Public Stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a Public Stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for Public Stockholders to use electronic delivery of their Public Shares. 
 There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. 
 After our Initial Business Combination is approved, we would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then has an option window after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of our stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to us for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become option rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holders election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved. 
 Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the stockholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a Public Share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of the Public Shares who elect to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our Initial Business Combination. 
 If our Initial Business Combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our Public Stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro-rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. 
 If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until the end of the Combination Period. 
 Redemption of Class A Common Stock and Liquidation if No Initial Business Combination 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we have only 24 months (or 30 months from the closing of the initial public offering if we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for our Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the initial public offering but have not completed our Initial Business Combination within such 24-month period) from the closing of the initial public offering to complete our Initial Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our business combination within the Combination Period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem all the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less $100,000 of accrued interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then-outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law; and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements 
 
15 


  of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our Redeemable Warrants, and our Distributable Redeemable Warrants will expire worthless and no Distributable Tontine Redeemable Warrants will have been issued if we fail to complete our business combination within the Combination Period. 
 If we fail to complete our Initial Business Combination within the Combination Period, our Class B Common Stock will not be able to convert into Class A Common Stock, and therefore will have no rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account in respect of their Class B shares, although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any Public Shares that they hold (however acquired). 
 Our Sponsor, directors and officers have agreed, pursuant to the Letter Agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemptions in connection with our Initial Business Combination, (ii) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of the Public Shares if we do not complete our Initial Business Combination within the Combination Period, or (iii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders rights or pre-Initial Business Combination activity, unless we provide our Public Stockholders with the opportunity to have their Public Shares redeemed upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then-outstanding Public Shares. However, we may not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our Initial Business Combination (so that we are not subject to the SECs penny stock rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of such shares, such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement (described above), we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of such shares at such time. 
 We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining held outside the trust account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any accrued interest in the trust account not required to pay our taxes as described herein, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses. 
 Without taking into account interest earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $20.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our Public Stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $20.00. Under Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL), our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors claims. 
 Although we seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business, execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest and claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our Public Stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including but not limited, to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third partys engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. 
 In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent auditors) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $20.00 per Public Share or (ii) such lesser amount per share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We have not independently verified whether our Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our 
 
16 


  Sponsors only assets are securities of our company. We have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our Initial Business Combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $20.00 per Public Share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our Initial Business Combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your Public Shares. None of our officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. 
 In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (i) $20.00 per Public Share or (ii) such lesser amount per share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. We have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations and we cannot assure you that our Sponsor would be able to satisfy these obligations. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $20.00 per Public Share. 
 We seek to reduce the possibility that our Sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our Sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. As of December 31, 2020, we have access to up to approximately $24 million from funds held outside the trust account to pay any such potential claims. In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors. 
 Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro-rata portion of our trust account distributed to our Public Stockholders upon the redemption of our Public Shares in the event we do not complete our business combination within the Combination Period may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholders pro-rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred with respect to claims commenced after the third anniversary of the dissolution. 
 Furthermore, if the pro-rata portion of our trust account distributed to our Public Stockholders upon the redemption of their Public Shares in the event we do not complete our business combination within the Combination Period, is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings that a party may bring due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. Unlike in the case of claims against stockholders relating to an unlawful liquidating distribution, however, stockholders are only liable for an unlawful redemption distribution if they knew that the redemption distribution was unlawful. If we are unable to complete our business combination within the Combination Period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then-outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law; and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our Public Shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 24th (or 30th) month and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date. 
 
17 


 Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time, that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our Sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) $20.00 per Public Share or (ii) such lesser amount per share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. 
 If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $20.00 per share to our Public Stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying Public Stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. 
 Our Public Stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) the completion of our Initial Business Combination; (ii) the redemption of any Public Shares that are properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemptions in connection with our Initial Business Combination, (B) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of the Public Shares if we do not complete our Initial Business Combination within the Combination Period or (C) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders rights or pre-Initial Business Combination activity; and (iii) the redemption of all of our Public Shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within the Combination Period, subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our Initial Business Combination, a stockholders voting in connection with our Initial Business Combination alone will not result in a stockholders redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro-rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights as described above. These provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, like all provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, may be amended with a stockholder vote. 
 Competition 
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity fund sponsors and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our Public Stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our Initial Business Combination and our then-outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our Initial Business Combination. 
Pershing Square Tontine Holdings II, Ltd. 
 We intend to launch a second SPAC (PSTH2) after we complete a business combination transaction. If we do so, we believe it is appropriate for our shareholders, including the Pershing Square Funds, to be able to invest in PSTH2 without paying a premium to its cash-in-trust value. There is no guarantee that we will complete an Initial Business Combination, and even if we are successful in doing so, that we will launch PSTH2.1 We have always believed in giving our existing investors the right to participate in new Pershing Square opportunities, and we intend to continue this tradition.

 Facilities 
 Our offices are at 787 Eleventh Avenue, 9th Floor, New York, NY 10019 and our telephone number is (212) 813-3700. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations. We do not expect to lease alternative office space from an unaffiliated third party. 
 Employees 
 We currently have four executive officers. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our Initial Business Combination. In addition, we have an investment team comprised of seven members, who are employed by PSCM. We believe our investment team is able to allocate their duties to us and to PSCM amongst themselves in a manner that allows them to provide us with the resources and support we require while fulfilling their responsibilities to PSCM. The amount of time that any such person devotes in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our Initial Business Combination and the current stage of the business combination process. 
Legal Proceedings 
 To our knowledge, there is no litigation currently pending against us or any of our officers or directors in their corporate capacity in the 12 months preceding the date hereof.
