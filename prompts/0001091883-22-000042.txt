Overview
As used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and “CIRCOR” mean CIRCOR International, Inc. and its subsidiaries (unless the context indicates another meaning). The term “common stock” means our common stock, par value $0.01 per share.
CIRCOR designs, manufactures and markets differentiated technology products and sub-systems for the industrial and aerospace and defense markets. We have a diversified flow and motion control product portfolio with recognized, market-leading brands that fulfill our customers’ mission critical and severe service needs. The Company’s strategy is to grow organically through innovative product development (including digital products), aftermarket growth, penetrating new regions, margin expansion and through complementary acquisitions; achieve world class operational excellence; and build an inclusive, growth-oriented culture that attracts and retains a diverse group of talent. We have a global presence and operate 21 major manufacturing facilities located in North America, Western Europe, Morocco, China and India. The Company has the following reportable business segments: Industrial segment (“Industrial”) and Aerospace & Defense segment (“Aerospace & Defense”). We sell our products directly to end-user customers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), as well as through Engineering, Procurement and Construction (“EPC”) companies and our channel partner network.
In 2020, we completed the divestiture of our loss-making Distributed Valves (“DV”) business. This action stemmed from our strategic decision to exit the upstream oil and gas valves market. This business and the associated loss on disposal were reported within discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements. The following discussion in this Item 1 relates only to our continuing operations unless otherwise noted. Refer to Note 1, Description of Business along with Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale, to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information. 
Strategies
Our objective is to enhance stockholder value by focusing on organic growth, margin expansion, improving free cash flow and focused capital deployment. Our strategy to achieve these objectives is to:
1) Build the best team. We are committed to creating a strong employee value proposition that attracts talented and diverse people to CIRCOR. We are also committed to investing in, engaging, challenging and developing our employees through a variety of development programs. Our goal is to build an inclusive, growth-oriented culture that, when combined with robust process, appropriate metrics and individual accountability, will deliver extraordinary results.
2) Drive organic growth. We serve mission critical applications across our A&D and Industrial portfolio, and typically enjoy competitive position in the market segments we serve. One of the pillars of our growth is customer intimacy. Strong insights into the needs of our current and prospective customers enable us to drive growth through new products, aftermarket support, value-based pricing and enhanced customer experience from order through delivery. We view aftermarket as key to both organic growth and margin expansion and we will continue exploring support opportunities for our customers, especially those in our Industrial segment. In A&D, our businesses are well positioned for growth from critical programs such as Navy submarines, missiles including hypersonic, fighter aircraft and narrowbody and widebody commercial aircraft platforms. In addition, we are finding use of our technologies in new markets including medical, hydrogen and space applications. We will continue to invest in new technologies and new programs where we can leverage our unique technical advantages.
3) Realize margin expansion. We have a successful track record of expanding margins in our A&D segment and continue to build on this success through value-based pricing, volume growth and the leverage of our best-cost manufacturing operations in Morocco. In Industrial we are implementing similar strategies to those that have been successful in A&D, including value-based pricing, focus on the aftermarket, leverage of best-cost manufacturing in India and China, as well as factory modernization and 80/20 simplification.
5) Optimize overhead cost. We continue to evaluate our cost structure across the organization. We are continuously looking for opportunities to simplify our structure, eliminate redundancies and align our teams closer to the customers. These initiatives have already resulted in structural cost-out in the first half of 2022 and we have identified specific areas of opportunities for further improvements which we are currently evaluating for future implementation. 
6) Achieve world class operational excellence. Our businesses are committed to achieving operational excellence in support of our customers’ expectations of high quality, on-time delivery and market competitiveness. We follow the CIRCOR Operating System (“COS”), which creates a disciplined culture of continuous improvement for driving operational excellence . COS is comprised of ten business process attributes designed to engage and empower our employees to recognize and eliminate waste, work real-time problem solving as part of their everyday job experience, and enhance our performance both in operations and front end processes. Quantitative performance metrics define site certification levels to help attain and sustain a high level of quality, productivity, inventory management and market competitiveness that delights our customers, stockholders, and employees.
7) Focused capital deployment. We have a portfolio of leading brands, differentiated technologies and strong customer relationships. We continually evaluate whether we are the best owners of our businesses, or whether we could undertake value enhancing divestitures. Although, our markets remain fragmented, and we see opportunity for complementary and value enhancing acquisitions, in the near term our focus is on organic investments, evaluating divestitures and reducing leverage

CIRCOR Consolidated
Competition
The domestic and international markets for our products are highly competitive. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than us. We consider product brand, quality, performance, on-time delivery, customer service, price, distribution capabilities and breadth of product offerings to be the primary competitive factors in these markets. We believe that new product development and product engineering also are important to our success and that our position in the industry is attributable, in significant part, to our ability to develop innovative products and to adapt existing products to specific customer applications. Our ability to leverage our large installed base of equipment to drive repairs and spares growth is a competitive advantage. 
The primary competitors of our Industrial segment include: Leistritz AG, Curtiss-Wright Corporation, Netzsch GmbH, ITT Corporation, IMI plc, SPX Flow, Inc., Seepex GmbH, and Naniwa Ltd. 
The primary competitors of our Aerospace & Defense segment include: Transdigm, Crane Co., Curtiss-Wright Corporation, Moog, Inc., Parker Hannifin Corp., and Woodward Inc.

The Industrial segment provides unique flow control products for viscous and critical fluids with specific design and engineering capabilities. 
We maintain a Global Engineering Center of Excellence in India with a capable technology and engineering team that complements the engineering resources in a business unit.
Customers
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, no customers accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated revenues. Our businesses sell into both long-term capital projects as well as short-cycle demand. As a result, we tend to experience fluctuations in orders, revenues and operating results at various points across economic and business cycles. 
Selling and Distribution
Across our businesses we utilize a variety of channels to market our products and solutions. Those channels include direct sales, distributors and commissioned representatives. Our channel partner network typically offers technically trained sales forces with strong relationships in key markets. We believe that our established, global direct and indirect sales channels constitute a competitive strength. We believe that we have good relationships with our channel partners. 
Intellectual Property
The Company relies upon a combination of trade secrets and patent and trademark registrations to protect its intellectual property. Our patents are scheduled to expire between 2022 and 2038, and our trademarks can be renewed as long as we continue to use them. We do not believe the vitality and competitiveness of any of our business segments as a whole depends on any one or more patents or trademarks. We own certain licenses such as software licenses, but we do not believe that our business as a whole depends on any one or more licenses.
Raw Materials
The raw materials used most often in our production processes are castings, forgings and bar stock of various materials, including stainless steel, carbon steel, bronze, copper, brass, titanium and aluminum. These materials are subject to price fluctuations that may adversely affect our results of operations. We purchase these materials from numerous suppliers and at times experience constraints on the supply of certain raw material as well as the inability of certain suppliers to respond to our needs. Historically, increases in the prices of raw materials have been partially offset by higher sales prices, active materials management, project engineering programs and the diversity of materials used in our production processes.
Regulatory and Environmental Matters
Our business and operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, both within and outside the United States, in areas such as: competition, government contracts, international trade, labor and employment, tax, environmental protection, workplace health and safety, and others. These and other laws and regulations impact the manner in which we conduct our business, and changes in legislation or government policies can affect our operations, both favorably and unfavorably. Below is a summary of the some of the significant regulations that impact our business (see also Part I, Item IA, Risk Factors).
Government Procurement. The services we provide to the U.S. federal government are subject to Federal Acquisition Regulation, the Truth in Negotiations Act, export controls rules and Department of Defense (DOD) security regulations, as well as many other laws and regulations. These laws and regulations affect how we transact business with our customers and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. A violation of specific laws and regulations could lead to fines, contract termination or suspension of future contracts. Our government clients can also terminate, renegotiate, or modify any of their contracts with us at their convenience.
Trade Controls. The export of our products is subject to applicable trade controls laws, including those in the U.S., the European Union, the United Kingdom and China, and include, but are not limited to, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the Export Administration Regulations, and trade sanctions against embargoed countries. A violation of specific laws and regulations could lead to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability.
Anti-Bribery. We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both private and public sectors. In addition, an organization that “fails to prevent bribery” committed by anyone 
associated with the organization can be charged under the U.K. Bribery Act unless the organization can establish the defense of having implemented “adequate procedures” to prevent bribery. 
Human Capital 
CIRCOR’s success depends on our ability to attract, develop, engage and retain key talent. Management oversees and drives a number of vital employee programs in support of these goals.
Employee Profile
As of December 31, 2021, CIRCOR had 3,120, employees, of whom approximately 98% are full-time. 43% of this workforce was in Europe, 40% in the United States, 11% in India and the rest spread across the rest of Asia, the Middle East and Latin America.
Approximately 37% of our workforce is composed of skilled direct labor working in our factories across the globe. 29% is indirect labor in support of this direct labor. 34% are selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) staff (including engineering, sales, finance, human resources and legal personnel). 6% of the Company’s U.S. employees are unionized. Outside the United States, we have employees in Europe that are represented by an employee representative organization, such as a union, works council or employee association.
Approximately 19% of the Company's global workforce is female, and 16% of the Company's employees in leadership roles are female. Approximately 34% of the Company's U.S. workforce and 23% of our U.S. employees in leadership roles are racially or ethnically diverse. At the Board of Directors level, 29% of our directors are female and 14% of our Board is racially or ethnically diverse. 
Talent Attraction
We employ a rigorous recruitment process to attract and hire the talent needed for our continued success and growth. This includes candidates from diverse backgrounds and with differing experiences. Candidates are carefully vetted and assessed in multiple stages and interviews. Our recruitment processes are designed to comply with local labor laws and regulations.
Attracting a more diverse candidate pool was a particular focus in 2021. We published a revamped careers page on our website, which included a specific section on diversity & inclusion and focused on improving our job descriptions, to make them more appealing to broader slate of potential candidates. We also provided a standardized interview guide and unconscious bias training to hiring managers in 2021.
In addition, we actively partner with universities across the globe to recruit promising graduate talent into various functions in the Company. We work with Kellogg School (Northwestern University) to hire graduating Master of Business Administration (“MBA”) students each year into the Company’s general management rotation program and have plans to expand the program to include engineering graduates, who will be hired to participate in an engineering rotation program.
Talent Development
CIRCOR is committed to developing our talent. Many of our employees participate in an annual Talent Review Process and Performance Management Process, which helps assess the performance as well as the potential of employees. We focus on investment in three main methods of developing talent: (1) on-the-job, technical or skills-based training, (2) mentorship and (3) leadership and executive development training.
We have offered a Senior Leadership Development Program for top leaders and a Management Development Program for mid-level managers. In addition, we actively train our employees on diversity and inclusion, interpersonal skills, process improvement skills, compliance topics as well as technical skills at the site level. We work with high potential employees to create Individual Development Plans for them and provide opportunities for assessments and coaching as needed. In 2021, 50% of leadership positions were filled internally as CIRCOR lays heavy emphasis on promoting from within and creating growth opportunities for our employees. We use annual succession planning and periodic sessions with business leaders and the People team throughout the year to understand the open roles for which internal candidates might be available to fill.
Talent Retention 
We are committed to creating a strong employee value proposition, and our retention strategy centers on building an inclusive, growth-oriented culture that is attractive to our employees. We have regular communications from our senior leaders to employees throughout the organization and provide channels for feedback.
We periodically conduct employee engagement surveys and other similar surveys to measure employee engagement and satisfaction. Our 2021 employee engagement survey had a greater than 70% participation rate, and measured employee engagement and satisfaction, and sought employee feedback, across a range of topics. In addition, our sites host town halls throughout the year to engage employees at a local level; some sites also have employee engagement committees that meet regularly with leadership to provide feedback. In 2021, while many of our employees continued to work from home, sites hosted online events to continue to facilitate employee engagement.
In addition, we offer competitive compensation and benefits packages that are designed to retain, motivate and reward our employees. CIRCOR has a Pay for Performance philosophy, and we align our compensation practices with reference to external benchmarks, internal comparisons and the relationship between management and non-management remuneration. We seek to ensure that our pay practices do not discriminate on the basis of gender or race, taking into account job-related responsibilities, geographic location, and individual employee work experience, education and performance. Some of our employees participate in our short-term and/or long-term incentive program connecting payouts to achievement of key financial and other metrics and the employee’s contribution to those results.
We also provide competitive benefits programs in line with local market practice. We regularly review our benefits packages globally, especially in light of changing employees’ expectations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the entrance of Generation Z to our workforce. During 2021 we supported more work from home opportunities, and we rolled out a Flex Work Policy to accommodate employees after pandemic measures are lifted. Additionally, we offer a global Employee Assistance Program to assist with our employee’s well-being.
We carefully monitor the voluntary attrition of our employees. In 2021, the annualized voluntary attrition rate was 9%. This is higher than last year but remains within our expectations. We believe 2020 was lower than our historical rates, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which we believe initially led to fewer employees leaving their jobs.
Employee Health & Safety
We are committed to protecting the health and safety of our employees, and safety is one of our Absolutes. Our Absolutes, which are Safety, Controls and Ethics, are the three imperatives underlying everything we do at CIRCOR. Our culture of safety includes an ongoing training program, stand downs when injury events occur and encouraging our employees to speak up if they see a safety hazard. In 2021, we instituted a Safety Action Plan to reinforce the fundamentals of safety and focus on leading indicators.
In addition to common lagging indicators used to track employee safety, such as injuries, we look to leading indicators, such as safety observations and near-misses, integrated with established problem-solving methodologies to resolve issues that endanger worker safety. In 2021, our Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) was 0.83 and our Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR) was 0.48. While these numbers are higher than our 2020 TRIR of 0.76 and LTIR of 0.32, nominal recordable incidents were flat and lost time incidents were up slightly year over year, with the ratios driven higher by a lower number of total hours worked across the organization. Additionally, 53% of our manufacturing sites had zero recordable incidents in 2021. We also had no work-related fatalities or incidents of occupational diseases. We aim to improve our safety numbers with continued training, regularly communicating our safety initiatives, and empowering our employees with measures including our Proactive Observation Program and Stop Work Authority.
We continue to strive to ensure the health, safety and general well-being of our teams. Actions we have taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, include the following:
•Encouraging those who are sick to stay home and continuing to use work-from-home where necessary to minimize potential outbreaks;
•Encouraging vaccination, and fully covering the cost of COVID-19 vaccinations
•Increasing cleaning protocols across all locations;
•Providing additional personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies;
•Implementing protocols to address actual and suspected COVID-19 cases and potential exposure;
•Utilization of masks to be worn as recommended by local law; and 
•Expanding our Employee Assistance Program to all of our employees worldwide. 
Diversity & Inclusion (“D&I”)
CIRCOR is committed to cultivating a workplace that makes diversity, equity, inclusion and transparency priorities in everything we do. In furtherance of that commitment, we have established active D&I initiatives in the areas of talent acquisition, talent development, total rewards, employee engagement and communications, which impact employees at all levels of the organization. In addition, we have a D&I Program Manager and Senior Executive Sponsor, who are driving our D&I initiatives and goals. Our primary goal is to increase gender and racial and ethnic representation throughout the organization, including senior management, and our initiatives are focused on that goal.
D&I achievements in 2021 included the following:
•Utilized metrics to understand penetration of activities and impact on creating diversity in the workplace;
•Included D&I review in periodic Talent Reviews with sites, including focus on Emerging Female Talent;
•Launched our second Employee Resource Group in late 2020, Pride & Allies @ CIRCOR;
•Continued employee communications on D&I topics and initiatives;
•Provided formal training on D&I to over 2,600 employees; and 
•Provided formal training on Unconscious Bias to approximately 1,500 employees.
