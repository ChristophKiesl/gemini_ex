Description of Business until April 28, 2014

Until April 28, 2014 the Company sold (directly and through distributors and sublicensees), in non-US countries, plastic intraoral devices known as Anterior Midpoint Stop Appliances (AMPSA Products). Our customers were dentists and doctors. The AMPSA Products, which are used for the treatment and prevention of common neurological and temporomandibular disorders including migraine headaches, migraine pain and bruxism. 

On April 28, 2014, we received a letter from Mr. J. Christopher Jaczko, a lawyer with the Procopio law firm in San Diego who represents Boyd Research, Inc. and related parties. In his letter, Mr. Jaczko notified us that our license to use the international patents for our AMPSA device, pursuant to our license agreement with his clients effective January 1, 2013, was terminated. The ostensible reason Mr. Jaczko gave was our failure to make certain unspecified payments due under the license agreement to his clients. We disputed the termination, but believed that the costs involved with litigating the termination of the New License was not in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. Therefore, the Company decided to move in new direction.






CURRENT BUSINESS DESCRIPTION

Therapeutic Solutions International, Inc. (TSI), is a public company (OTC:TSOI) focused on immune modulation for the treatment of several specific diseases. Immune modulation refers to the ability to upregulate (make more active) or downregulate (make less active) ones immune system.

Activating ones immune system is now a well-accepted method to cure certain cancers, reduce recovery time from viral or bacterial infections and to prevent illness. On the other hand, inhibiting ones immune system is vital for reducing inflammation, autoimmune disorders and allergic reactions.

TSI is developing a range of immune-modulatory agents to target certain cancers, improve maternal and fetal health, fight periodontal disease, and for daily health. The following discusses the focus of TSI on each of these programs:

Principle Products and Services

Clinical Stage Dexosome

TSOI recently licensed in 2016 a Dexosome Clinical Stage Cancer Immunotherapy Product from Gustave Roussy European Cancer Centre. Planning is still underway as to next steps.

Dexosomes are exosome nanoparticles generated by dendritic cells, which have previously been used by investigators at Anosys, Inc., in collaboration with researchers at Duke University, for treatment of cancer patients as part of an FDA-cleared Phase I clinical trial1. The licensed patent was invented by internationally-renowned immunologists Sebastian Amigorena, Doctor at the Curie Institute, and Laurence Zitvogel, Professor at Gustave Roussy. The patent covers means of generating therapeutically-effective dexosomes, which can act as a platform for loading any tumor antigen desired. 

In the area of drug development, much of the risk is taking the technology from the lab to the patient. We are fortunate that the current technology has already been utilized in patients under FDA jurisdiction, and has demonstrated safety with signs of efficacy.

The in-licensing of the current patent augments previously filed patent applications by TSOI, including one filed in November 2015, covering uses of exosomes to stimulate both innate and adaptive arms of the immune response2. The Company plans to leverage the experience of its newest Board Member, Dr. Thomas Ichim, to lead the Dexosome program back into clinical trials. Dr. Ichim has previously patented the manipulation of exosomes in the area of cancer therapy for alleviation of immune suppression3, as well as being published in the peer-reviewed literature in this area4,5.

Pterostilbene (pronounced "tero-STILL-bean") has created a buzz in the world of nutrition research. Scientists discovered this powerful antioxidant several decades ago and have since found that it rivals its cousin resveratrol's multi-functional abilities, and may actually exceed its anti-aging and health promoting potential. Found naturally in blueberries, pterostilbene has been shown in emerging experimental studies to exhibit up to 7 times greater bioavailability than resveratrol as well as better metabolic stability. This translates to potentially higher levels of pterostilbene in the blood upon ingestion, and longer lasting effects in the body compared to resveratrol. More simply put, it remains active in your body for a much greater period of time and during this enhanced bio-available period your body has the opportunity to allow it to utilize this powerful antioxidant molecule.

A large body of experimental research has now documented a wide range of potential health effects associated with pterostilbene. In fact, the more researchers study pterostilbene, the greater its human health potential becomes. In addition to being a powerful antioxidant, emerging experimental research suggests this plant compound may also help regulate cell growth, promote fat metabolism, support glucose utilization, influence brain function, and improve the body's natural detoxification enzymes that are required to help protect cells against potentially damaging compounds from the environment.

Patents:

TSOI filed a patent covering the use of its ProJuvenol® product, as well as various pterostilbene compositions, for use in augmenting efficacy of existing immuno-oncology drugs that are currently on the market. The patent is based on the ability of pterostilbene, one of the major ingredients of ProJuvenol®, to reduce oxidative stress produced by cancer cells, which in turn protects the immune system from cancer mediated immune suppression.

Immuno-Oncology, described by Science Magazine as 'Breakthrough of the Year1' offers the possibility of not only killing tumor cells in a non-toxic manner, but also establishing immunological memory, which patrols the body and destroys recurrent tumor cells. While great progress has been made in developing drugs that stimulate the immune system to recognize and kill tumors, a major pitfall of current approaches is that tumors produce chemicals and oxidative stress that suppresses the immune system, thus limiting efficacy of immune therapies.

Pterostilbene, which is chemically related to resveratrol, has been published to possess anticancer2,3, antioxidant4, and anti-inflammatory activities5. Through the filing of the recent patent, the company is exploring whether its lead product, ProJuvenol®, may be useful as a nutraceutical adjuvant to conventional cancer immunotherapies. 

The importance of proper nutrition in the context of immunotherapy cannot be overstated. Studies on one of the original cancer immunotherapies, interleukin-2, demonstrated that efficacy was related to anti-oxidant content in the patients at time of therapy6. Accordingly, we are seeking through the current work to identify whether our currently marketed product, ProJuvenol®, may be utilized as part of an integrative approach to building up the immune response of cancer patients.

In addition on April 28, 2016 the Company filed a patent application covering the use of ProJuvenol© and its active ingredient pterostilbene for augmentation of stem cell activity. Diseases such as diabetes1, cardiovascular disease2, and neurodegenerative diseases3 are characterized by deficient stem cell activity. The patent covers the stimulation of stem cells that already exist in the patients body, as well as stem cells that are administered therapeutically.

Studies have shown that patients who have higher levels of endogenous stem cell activity have reduced cardiovascular disease risk4 and undergo accelerated neurological recovery after stroke5 as compared to patients with lower numbers of such stem cells.

TSOI markets currently two other nutraceuticals, T-Rx®, a testosterone booster, and Vital® Female, an estrogen booster and has just introduced a line of oncologist friendly nutraceuticals in liposome formula. These include CoQ10, Curcumin, Glutathione, and Vitamin-C in 16oz bottles. Website: www.youcanordernow.com

ProJuvenol® - Is a powerful synergistic blend of complex anti-aging ingredients inspired by nature to help promote cellular rejuvenation and healthy functionality for everyday living. Based upon one of nature's unique and intelligent anti- oxidants/anti-inflammatories. 
T-Rx® - Is specifically designed just for men and is formulated to assist in increasing testosterone levels and keeping them high. The result is a significant increase in testosterone levels, which assist in adding lean muscle mass, bone density, increased energy and the reduction of fat. 
VITAL® - Is specifically formulated for women and is designed to increase energy, increase bone density, reduce fat and improve muscle tone. Additionally this supplement will also optimize hormone levels, increase libido, and decrease symptoms of stress and anxiety. 
Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a substance similar to a vitamin. It is found in every cell of the body. Your body makes CoQ10, and your cells use it to produce energy your body needs for cell growth and maintenance. It also functions as an antioxidant, which protects the body from damage caused by harmful molecules. 
Curcumin is an anti-inflammatory molecule in the turmeric root, a relative of ginger. The properties of curcumin can best be summarized as protective of the integrity of bio molecules in the body by being both a fabulous antioxidant and anti-inflammatory all rolled up in one. 
Glutathione is one of the most powerful antioxidants that the body produces and is used to bind and remove toxins, including heavy metals such as mercury and lead from the body. Levels may drop as result of oxidative stress due to disease, drugs, aging, toxic chemicals, inflammation and stress. Adequate levels of glutathione are necessary to provide important antioxidant protection.
Vitamin-C is absorbed at approximately 19%, the balance remains in the gastrointestinal tract to attract water and loosen the bowels. Liposomalized vitamin C is absorbed much more efficiently than traditional delivery methods. A huge advance in both efficiency and effectiveness of supplemental nutrients. 


Fetal-Maternal Health

OmniBiome, Inc.

OmniBiome, Inc. a partially-owned subsidiary is focused on therapeutic / Rx approaches to either utilize or intervene with the systemic effects of the vaginal, lactal-duct and oral microbiomes for improving maternal healthcare and resulting birth outcomes. Mr. Dixon and Mr. Berg, of the Company, are also officers and Directors of Omni. As of October 25, 2016, TSI owns approximately 73.75% of the outstanding shares of OmniBiome. Website:  www.omnibiomeinc.com

The Company will focus initially on developing CLIA Dx services for both pre-pregnancy-associated and pregnancy-associated conditions or diseases where there is a substantive link with microbiome dysbiosis (disruption or imbalance), as well as on restoring eubiosis (proper balance).

In parallel OmniBiome will build a database of aggregated patient data that will later inform development of Rx / therapeutic and medical device & drug-device combination approaches for treating the same conditions or diseases.

MicroBiome Targets

Certain microbiome target markets offer immediate revenue-generating business opportunities such as vaginal and lactal-duct microbiome banking & transplants from mother to child in the case of C-section-born babies, babies of non-nursing mothers, and children under 5 years of age receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics

OmniBiomes main focus will be on developing Dx / Rx products & services for pregnancy-associated conditions or diseases where there is a documented or substantive putative link with microbiome dysbiosis and resulting inflammatory cascades

In parallel the Company will look to create alliances and/or out-license its Medical Device / Drug Device Combinations patent portfolio.

The Company also plans to in-license microbiome - and pregnancy-related Rx & Dx innovations from universities and research institutes  with several having been identified.

The Human Microbiome Link

The following microbiomes combined recapitulate approximately 75 - 80 % of the gut microbiome, hence OmniBiome sees no need to focus on the gut microbiome

The Vaginal Microbiome comprises approximately 300 - 600 species of bacteria. 100s of species are transferred to the newborn child orally as the baby passes thru the birth canal. C-section-born children miss this important microbiome transfer
The Breast Milk Microbiome contains between 200 - 700 species of bacteria and is transferred to the child via nursing. Babies of non-nursing mothers miss this equally important transfer.

The Oral Microbiome diversity spectrum also covers 600 species shared with the baby via kissing and sharing eating utensils  with both the mother & the father.
