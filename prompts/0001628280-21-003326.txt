Item 1.        Business
Our Company
Extended Stay America-branded hotels are designed to provide an affordable and attractive alternative to traditional lodging or apartment accommodations and are targeted toward self-sufficient, value-conscious guests who need lodging for a week or longer. Guests include business travelers, leisure travelers, professionals on temporary work or training assignments, persons relocating, the temporarily displaced, those purchasing a home and anyone else in need of temporary housing.
We are the largest integrated owner/operator of company-branded hotels in North America. Our business operates in the extended-stay segment of the lodging industry, and we have the following reportable operating segments: 
•Owned hotels—Earnings are derived from the operation of Company-owned hotel properties and include room and other hotel revenues, which accounted for 98.1% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020.
•Franchise and management—Earnings are derived from fees under various franchise and management agreements with third parties, which accounted for 1.9% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. These contracts provide us the ability to earn compensation for licensing the Extended Stay America brand name, providing access to shared system-wide platforms and/or management services.
We are also the only major hotel company focused solely on the extended stay segment. We target our product and service offering to an underserved customer base within the lodging industry and the extended stay segment. In addition to owning and operating hotels, we have increased and seek to continue to increase our fee-based income stream, which is driven by franchising our brand to third parties. Our core operations include intense focus on the delivery of a consistent, quality guest experience; the efficiency of our scalable marketing and distribution platforms; maximizing the value of our brand, in-part through rebranding our hotels to the Extended Stay America Suites brand or the Extended Stay America Premier Suites brand, each of which we expect will operate under the Extended Stay America umbrella brand; and maximizing the value of our owned real estate through investment in our hotels. We intend to continue to (i) maximize and grow our core operations, (ii) create and curate value within our real estate portfolio, (iii) increase the number of franchised hotels under the Extended Stay America umbrella brand and (iv) optimize capital deployment on behalf of key stakeholders.
As of December 31, 2020, we owned and operated 563 hotel properties in 40 U.S. states, consisting of approximately 62,700 rooms, and franchised 83 hotel properties for third parties, consisting of approximately 8,500 rooms. All 646 system-wide hotels currently operate under the Extended Stay America brand, which serves the mid-price extended stay segment and accounts for approximately 43% of the segment by number of rooms in the United States. 
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had total revenues of $1.0 billion, net income of $96.3 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $374.1 million. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA. 
Our History
We were founded in 1995 as a developer, owner and operator of extended stay hotels. Following a period focused on new development, we became a consolidator of hotel properties by selectively acquiring extended stay companies and hotels, ultimately creating the largest mid-price extended stay company in North America. We were acquired in October 2010 and in November 2013, we reorganized and completed an initial public offering. We currently operate our extended stay hospitality platform with approximately 7,400 employees and are led by a management team with public company experience in hospitality, consumer retail and other service businesses.
Under our structure, ownership of a Paired Share represents an ownership interest in our hotel properties through ESH REIT and an ownership interest in our franchising and hotel management business, including the operation of our owned hotels, through the Corporation. This structure permits us to enjoy some, though not all, of the benefits of a REIT (i.e., while ESH REIT is taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, all distributions paid by ESH REIT to the Corporation are subject to corporate level tax, effectively eliminating approximately 59% of the tax benefit of REIT status). See “—Our Corporate Structure.” 
The Corporation
Extended Stay America, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on July 8, 2013. As of December 31, 2020, the Corporation leased and operated 563 hotels, consisting of approximately 62,700 rooms, and franchised 83 hotels for third parties, consisting of approximately 8,500 rooms. The 563 hotels are owned by ESH REIT and are leased to, operated and managed by wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Corporation. All hotels currently operate under the Extended Stay America brand. In the near future, we expect to rebrand our hotels to the Extended Stay America Suites brand or the Extended Stay America Premier Suites brand, each of which will operate under the Extended Stay America umbrella brand. Wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Corporation own the brand and intellectual property related to our business and license them to third-party franchisees.
ESH REIT
ESH Hospitality, Inc. was formed as a limited liability company in Delaware on September 16, 2010, and was converted to a corporation on November 5, 2013. ESH REIT owns 563 hotel properties, five of which are subject to ground leases, that are leased to and operated by subsidiaries of the Corporation as described above. ESH REIT has elected and expects to continue to be taxed as a REIT.
Our Brand
We currently operate all our hotels under the Extended Stay America brand. All Extended Stay America-branded hotels feature in-room kitchens, free WiFi, flat screen TVs with premium cable channels and on-site guest laundry.
We recently conducted robust, guest-centric research to more deeply understand extended stay guest segments and establish a brand architecture that best resonates with our guests. Through these efforts, we identified a large, immediately adjacent, higher-rated extended stay target segment. This finding, in combination with industry data available to us, informed our decision to launch a step-up brand.
Later this year, we expect to launch our new step-up brand, Extended Stay America Premier Suites. The launch will include 32 existing newly constructed or recently renovated hotels. The brand will be defined by upgraded amenities, such as signature bedding, a free healthy breakfast bar, larger TVs, upgraded kitchens and spacious apartment-style room layouts. The hotels chosen for inclusion in the launch will require no additional capital investment beyond signage. This new brand is designed to increase our penetration of higher-rated extended stay guests, and we expect that Extended Stay America Premier Suites will grow by investing in select existing assets and through franchise development. All owned, newly constructed Extended Stay America hotels will be part of the Extended Stay America Premier Suites brand.
Our core offering will be re-branded to Extended Stay America Suites. We believe the addition of this modifier is a better fit for our product and expect it will result in a higher intent to stay and willingness to pay. We will refresh all marketing and distribution channels with our new branding, but in the interest of minimizing capital investment, the logo will remain largely intact and physical on-property changes will be contained to only the most visible signage.
This marks an important transition for us from a single-branded company to a multi-brand portfolio of Extended Stay America Suites and Extended Stay America Premier Suites under the Extended Stay America umbrella. A key finding from our research is that although we intend to expand our brand architecture, it is important to preserve the foundational Extended Stay America brand name, as it enjoys significant brand awareness as the category leader and high familiarity.

Our Industry
U.S. Lodging Industry
The lodging industry is a significant part of the U.S. economy and consists of over five million hotel rooms, according to AHLA. Lodging industry performance is generally tied to both macro and micro-economic trends in the United States and, similar to other industries, experiences both positive and negative operating cycles. Following a growth cycle of more than ten years, the lodging industry entered into a recession in early 2020 resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly due to certain government-imposed regulations and changes in customer behavior. For the first time since 2010, RevPAR declined for the U.S. lodging industry. According to PwC, RevPAR for the overall U.S. lodging industry declined 47.3% in 2020, and is expected to grow 19.1% in 2021. According to PWC, room supply declined 8.6% in 2020 and is expected to grow 5.2% in 2021.
U.S. Extended Stay Segment
Extended stay hotels represent a growing segment within the U.S. lodging industry, with approximately 545,000 rooms for the year ended December 31, 2020, according to Highland. The extended stay segment tends to follow the cyclicality of the overall lodging industry. Extended stay hotels are differentiated by price point into economy, mid-price and upscale segments. Our business is focused on the mid-price extended stay segment, which accounted for approximately 31% of the supply of extended stay rooms in 2020, approximately 43% of which are branded Extended Stay America.
Seasonality
The lodging industry is seasonal in nature. The Company’s revenues are generally lower during the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year as is typical in the U.S. lodging industry. Because many of the Company’s hotel operating and general and administrative expenses are fixed and do not fluctuate with changes in revenues, declines in revenues can cause disproportionate fluctuations or decreases in the Company’s quarterly earnings and operating cash flows during these periods.
ESH REIT’s revenues and earnings are generally highest during the fourth quarter of each calendar year as rental revenues contingent upon lessee hotel revenues are not deemed as earned for accounting purposes until certain lessee hotel revenue thresholds are achieved, which typically occurs in the fourth quarter. ESH REIT’s cash flows generally remain consistent each quarter.
Cyclicality
The lodging industry is cyclical and its fundamental performance tends to follow the general economy, albeit on a lagged basis. There is a history of increases and decreases in demand for hotel rooms, occupancy levels and rates realized by owners and operators of hotel properties through economic cycles. Variability of results through some economic cycles in the past has been more severe due to changes in the supply of hotel rooms in given markets or in given categories of hotels. The combination of changes in economic conditions and in the supply of hotel rooms can result in significant volatility in results of operations for owners, operators and/or franchisors of hotel properties. The costs of running a hotel, and in particular an extended stay hotel, tend to be more fixed than variable. Because of this, in an environment of either increasing or decreasing revenues, the rate of change in earnings will likely be greater than the rate of change in revenues. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Lodging Industry—The lodging industry, including the extended stay segment, is cyclical and a worsening of general economic conditions or low levels of economic growth could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders.”
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive industry, with sources of competition including other extended stay hotel brands, transient-oriented hotel brands that compete for both transient and extended stay guests and alternative lodging (including serviced apartments and private homes and rooms and apartments rented on the internet, also referred to as “peer-to-peer inventory sources”). In addition, we face competition for both quality acquisition opportunities and locations to build new hotels and for hotel owners and developers as potential franchisees. We also face competition from third-party intermediaries and, increasingly, from new channels of distribution, such as large companies that offer online travel services as part of their business model and search engines. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Lodging Industry—We operate in a highly competitive industry and our inability to effectively compete for hotel guests or franchise contracts could have a material 
adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.”
Cultivation of the Best People and Evolution of Our Culture
Extended Stay America focuses on caring for people who are building a better future for themselves and their families. We work to achieve this mission by collectively and individually acting in ways that exemplify our key values: (i) put people first, (ii) do what’s right, (iii) create opportunity for growth and (iv) care for our community. While we understand that our values make the Company special, we believe that our behaviors make these values real.
We employ approximately 7,400 employees. Approximately 7,000 of these employees are hotel property-level employees, comprised of approximately 4,200 full-time employees and approximately 2,800 part-time employees. We believe our relationship with employees is good. None of our employees are currently represented by unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements.
Integral to the Company being able to fulfill its mission, including being able to deliver on operational and financial objectives, is ensuring we have the human capital necessary to execute our strategies to deliver results. Our human capital strategy includes the following elements:
•Effective recruitment and retention – it is critical that our hotels are staffed with skilled associates who are well supported; we utilize expansive recruitment strategies to select and train capable, experienced talent.
•Engaged performance review and management – we perform training and talent reviews regularly in order to ensure we have the appropriate capability and capacity to deliver expected levels of performance; we identify planned and contingency successors for positions at multiple levels in the organization.
•Engaged and inspired workforce – in order to meet and exceed the expectations of our guests, our workforce needs to clearly understand the Company’s mission and what is expected daily; our compensation programs aim to incentivize the achievement of individual and enterprise-wide objectives.
•Leveraging diversity, equity and inclusion – we are focused on ensuring the Company’s culture and practices reflect our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion; we seek to create process and discipline which drive behaviors that are committed to building a more inclusive culture, valuing differences, fostering personal belonging, accountability for performance and supporting the improvement of the lives or our associates, guests and their families.
Sales, Marketing and Reservations
Approximately 43.2% of our total revenues in 2020 were derived from accounts managed by our sales team. This team is focused on growing the value of existing accounts, developing new business and partnering with our operations team to drive local and regional sales. We focus on customers with extended stay lodging needs, including major Fortune 500 companies, small and medium sized businesses, construction and project-based work, relocation and staffing consultants, as well as medical, technology, military and government organizations. In 2020, our sales organization focused on industry segments and accounts where workers must be physically present, such as construction, supply chain logistics and temporary medical workers. We expect the emphasis on these industries and accounts to continue.
We seek to maximize revenue in each hotel through our revenue management function, which determines prices and manages the availability of room inventory to different channels and customer segments. Our automated revenue management system allows us to automatically price against demand. Our objective with increases in occupancy is to achieve ADR growth by increasing our mix of 7-29 night customers and capturing a greater portion of retail and corporate rates with guests who stay 30 nights or longer. 
Our marketing strategy is focused on growing awareness of our brand, including the recent announcement and forthcoming implementation of our new brand architecture, as well as driving demand for our hotels through a combination of media channels. We place a significant emphasis on digital marketing, buying search engine placement, internet display advertising and other media to drive traffic to our proprietary website and call center. We made enhancements to our website in 2020 and in 2021, expect to launch a redesigned website in order to increase traffic, conversion and ultimately revenue through simplifying the booking process, improving speed and reliability and employing a mobile-first strategy. We maintain a customer database and use it for targeted marketing activity. Our customer loyalty program, called Extended Perks, had more than 3.7 million members as of December 31, 2020. We believe this program has helped, and will continue to help, us generate repeat business and market directly to more of our customers.
We use a central reservation system to provide access to our hotel inventory through a wide variety of channels, including property-direct, our central call center, our website, travel agency global distribution systems and third-party intermediaries. We outsource our central reservation system and call center. In 2020, we facilitated a significant channel shift toward our most valuable and profitable proprietary channels. The proportion of owned hotel revenues from each of our distribution channels during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, was as follows:

 | Year Ended December 31, | | | 
 | 2020 | | 2019 | | % Change
Property direct | 25.9 | % | | 24.5 | % | 1.4 | %
Central call center | 31.5 | % | | 26.7 | % | 4.8 | %
Proprietary website | 21.3 | % | | 19.2 | % | 2.1 | %
Third-party intermediaries | 18.8 | % | | 26.2 | % | (7.4) | %
Travel agency global distribution systems | 2.5 | % | | 3.4 | % | (0.9) | %
 | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | | 

We aim to improve channel profitability in 2021 by accelerating direct revenue through the redesign of our website, continued improvement of call center performance and better definition of the loyalty program. We also intend to continue to leverage our core strategic competitive advantage, a uniquely singular focus on extended stay guests, by targeting and driving business with guests who stay seven nights or longer.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
Our hotel properties are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws relating to environmental protection. Under these laws, governmental entities have the authority to require us, as the current or former owner of a property, to perform or pay for the clean-up of contamination (including hazardous substances, waste or petroleum products) at or emanating from the property and to pay for natural resource damage arising from contamination. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the contamination. Such liability can be joint and several, so that each covered person can be responsible for all of the costs involved, even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination. We can also be liable to private parties for costs of remediation, personal injury and death and/or property damage resulting from contamination at or emanating from our owned hotel properties. Moreover, environmental contamination can affect the value of a property and, therefore, an owner’s ability to borrow funds using the property as collateral or to sell the property on favorable terms or at all. Furthermore, persons who sent waste to a waste disposal facility, such as a landfill or an incinerator, may be liable for costs associated with cleanup of that facility. 
Phase I environmental assessments were obtained for substantially all of our owned hotel properties in 2012 and for all hotel properties that we have purchased since that time. The Phase I environmental assessments were intended to identify potential contamination, but did not include any invasive sampling procedures, such as soil or ground water sampling. The Phase I environmental assessments identified a number of known or potential environmental conditions associated with historic uses of the hotel properties or adjacent properties. However, the Phase I environmental assessments did not identify any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, results of operations or liquidity. It is possible that these environmental assessments did not reveal all potential environmental liabilities, such as the presence of former underground tanks for the storage of petroleum-based or waste products, that could create a potential for release of hazardous substances. In addition, it is possible that environmental liabilities have arisen since the assessments were completed. No assurances can be given that (i) future regulatory requirements will not impose any material environmental liability, or (ii) the current environmental condition of our hotel properties will not be affected by the condition of properties in the vicinity of our hotel properties (such as the presence of leaking underground storage tanks) or by third parties unrelated to us.
In addition, our hotels (including our real property, operations and equipment) are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety regulatory requirements that address a wide variety of issues, including, but not limited to, the use, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, air emissions, discharges of waste materials (such as refuge or sewage), the registration, maintenance and operation of our boilers and storage tanks, asbestos and lead-based paint. Some of our hotels also routinely handle and use hazardous or regulated substances and wastes as part of their operations, which are subject to regulation (i.e., swimming pool chemicals or biological waste). Our hotels incur costs to comply with these environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and if these regulatory requirements are not met or become more stringent in the future, or unforeseen events result in the discharge of dangerous or toxic substances at our hotel properties, we could be subject to materially increased costs of compliance, fines and penalties for non-compliance, and material liability from 
third parties for harm to the environment, damage to real property or personal injury and death. We are aware of no past or present environmental liability for non-compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations. However, additional operating cash and capital expenditures could be incurred if new or more stringent requirements are enacted in the future.
Certain hotels we own or those we may acquire in the future contain, may contain, or may have contained asbestos-contaminating material (“ACM”). Environmental, health and safety laws require that ACM be properly managed and maintained, and include requirements to undertake special precautions, such as removal or abatement if ACM would be disturbed during maintenance, renovation or demolition of a building. These laws regarding ACM may impose fines and penalties on building owners, employers and operators for failure to comply with these requirements or expose us to third-party liability. We are not presently aware of ACM at our hotel properties that would result in a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations.
When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Exposure to mold may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant mold at any of our owned hotel properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected property. In addition, the presence of significant mold could expose us to liability from our guests, employees and others if or when property damage or health concerns arise. We are not presently aware of any indoor air quality issues at our owned hotel properties that would result in a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations.
We have obtained environmental insurance subject to limits, deductibles and exclusions customarily carried for similar businesses. We believe that our environmental insurance policy is appropriate and adequate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice; however, our environmental insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover our losses. Although our franchise and management agreements include broad indemnity provisions that encompass environmental claims resulting from franchised or managed properties, there can be no assurance that the indemnifying counterparties would be solvent or otherwise able to indemnify us if we were found liable for those claims.
Intellectual Property
In the highly competitive hospitality industry in which we operate, trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos and other proprietary rights are very important to the success of our business. The Corporation has a significant number of trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, other proprietary rights and pending registrations and expends significant resources on their surveillance, registration and protection.
Regulation
A number of states and local governments regulate the licensing of hotels by requiring registration, disclosure statements and compliance with specific standards of conduct. We believe that each of our owned hotels has the necessary permits and approvals to operate its respective business and we intend to continue to obtain these permits and approvals for any new hotels. We are also subject to laws governing our relationship with our employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, meal and rest periods, working conditions and work permit requirements. An increase in the minimum wage rate, employee benefit costs or other costs associated with employees could materially adversely affect our business, including our results of operations. There are frequently proposals under consideration at the federal, state and local levels to increase the minimum wage and to expand overtime pay and benefits requirements. Compliance with new laws and regulations can affect the profitability of hotels franchised or owned and could adversely affect our operations.
Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”), all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. We attempt to satisfy ADA requirements in the designs for and operation of our hotels, websites and other facilities subject to the ADA, but we cannot assure you that we will not be subjected to a material ADA claim. If that were to happen, we could be ordered to spend substantial sums to achieve compliance, fines could be imposed against us and we could be required to pay damage awards to private litigants. The ADA and other regulatory initiatives could materially adversely affect our business as well as the lodging industry in general.
The Federal Trade Commission and numerous states regulate the sale and termination of franchises and business opportunities. These regulations generally impose registration and filing requirements and in some cases control specific terms of franchise agreements. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in franchisees having the right to rescind their franchise agreements as well as fines, penalties and injunctive relief imposed by regulating authorities.
Insurance
Properties that we manage, franchise and own outright are insured under different insurance programs depending on whether the property participates in our insurance programs or in the insurance programs of the property owner. We maintain insurance coverage for our owned hotels under our insurance programs for liability, property, workers compensation and other risks with respect to our business. Our liability insurance provides coverage for most claims, including terrorism, our operations and automobiles. Our property insurance provides coverage for risks to our properties including fire, windstorm, flood, earthquake and terrorism. Property insurance also includes business interruption coverage. Our workers compensation insurance provides coverage for employee injuries in the course and scope of employment. We also maintain cyber-risk insurance for systems and data controlled by us. Cyber-risk insurance generally covers all Company-controlled systems and Company-controlled data in properties that we manage, franchise and own. We believe our insurance policies, as well as those maintained by third-party owners are adequate for foreseeable losses and on terms and conditions that are reasonable and customary with solvent insurance carriers. Our franchise agreements require our franchisees to maintain liability, property, business interruption, workers compensation and other insurance at our franchised properties. While we believe that our insurance coverage is adequate, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if we were held liable for amounts exceeding the limits of our insurance coverage or for claims outside the scope of our insurance coverage.
