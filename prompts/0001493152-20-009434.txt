ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Corporate Background and Our Business
 
Our Vision
 
EVIO, Inc. supports and optimizes our clients’ businesses, and protects the health and safety of consumers by providing analytical testing, compliance consulting, and research & development services to the legal cannabis and hemp industries.
 
Our founders believe that products derived from the cannabis sativa plant could have the potential to provide an alternative to pharmaceutical products and may improve wellness. Our founders also believe that it is imperative that there be third party verification of the safety and quality of these products by qualified scientists in adherence with the highest accreditation standards, including ISO 17025, TNI NELAP, and GMP.
 
We believe that as we leverage best practices from labs across North America, we are building standardized and optimized methods and procedures that will provide EVIO a considerable advantage in a future global market for cannabis and hemp ingredients and products.
 
We work to ensure the EVIO brand is synonymous with safe, high quality products.
 
Our Services
 
EVIO, Inc’s core business is analytical testing services for cannabis and hemp growers, product formulators, processors, distributors, and retailers. We perform testing as required by state and provincial mandates, as well as for research and development or informational purposes.
 
Tests include identification and quantification of compounds including cannabinoids such as THC and CBD, and terpenes. This testing includes mandated hemp field verifications, quantitation for product labeling, and testing to support product formulations. We also perform homogeneity and process control testing, and other tests to determine the quality and conformance of cannabis products.
 
We also identify contaminants such as solvents, pesticides, e. coli, salmonella, aflatoxins, excess moisture, and heavy metals in cannabis and related products including soils, water, hemp and CBD products.
 
Our labs rely on instrumentation including High Performance Liquid Chromatography (PLC) for cannabinoid testing; triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry for pesticide testing; gas chromatography for solvent and terpene testing; Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICPMS) to identify heavy metal; Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology for identification of DNA or RNA from harmful microbial contaminants; and other support instruments including moisture analyzers and water activity meters, plating, and microscopy.
 
EVIO Biosciences and our advisory services work include providing technical guidance to our clients and governments in the areas of industry best practices, regulatory compliance, support for product formulation, assisting businesses with setting up their own internal research laboratories, providing expert advice and data to governments and financial auditors, and assisting with state and local cannabis licensing. We also leverage our expertise and access to data to perform R&D and identify new and novel testing methods and gain insights about cannabis and its potential uses.
 
Our Team
 
Our company is led by a team of technology-focused professionals who came from Fortune-500 companies. Each of our labs are led by experienced laboratory directors who hold PhD’s or other advanced degrees in chemistry, biology, chemical engineering or other sciences. Our laboratory teams include analytical chemists and biologists and laboratory technicians who are trained to EVIO’s standardized methods and procedures to be both specialists in one area of testing and attain cross-training in other tests.
 
Our teams collaborate across labs to share best practices, and we continuously improve our methods and processes across all labs based on lessons learned in each. The ability to learn from labs across the country provides a significant advantage compared to our competitors that operate one or two labs.

During 2014 and 2015, Signal Bay’s primary business focus was providing consulting services, market research, and data analysis for businesses, governments, and individuals, involved with the emerging legal cannabis industry. In 2015, the founders identified the testing market as an underserved segment of the emerging cannabis industry that provided a service that was in alignment with our vision to contribute to the development of a safe and compliant industry.
 
In September 2015, the Company acquired a majority stake of an analytical testing laboratory in Bend, OR. The Company continued to acquire laboratories with the goal of attaining best practices and capturing market share in advance of the adult-use legalization of cannabis in Oregon. By 2018, the Company had acquired 4 testing labs in Oregon and gained licensing and accreditation for all four labs to perform testing to the newly adopted rigorous testing standards required by the State of Oregon. The labs began operating under one name, EVIO Labs. The company continued its growth in other states, through both acquisitions and licensing agreements.
 
In August 2018, Signal Bay, Inc. changed its name to EVIO, Inc.
 
In January 2019, the Company acquired C3 Labs, LLC, a cannabis research and development laboratory in Berkeley California. During 2019, we expanded the scope of lab services to include compliance testing, in anticipation of newly adopted rules to serve California’s mandated testing requirements.
 
In May 2019, the Company formed EVIO Canada, Inc. and acquired a 50% state in Keystone Labs, Inc. located in Edmonton, Alberta. Keystone provides a full array of analytical and microbiological testing services for pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device, nutraceutical, and medical cannabis industries.
 
In September 2019, the company operated or licensed labs in 6 states and Alberta, Canada.

EVIO Business Segments
 
The Company currently has three principal business segments: (1) Management and Corporate; (2) Consulting Services to the cannabis industry; and (3) Analytical Testing Services to the cannabis industry.
 
None of the Company’s business segments constitutes the transport, production, distribution, storage, sale or possession of cannabis for non-medical purposes.
 
1. Management and Corporate
 
The Company provides overall management and corporate reporting functions for the entire organization. This includes marketing, human resources, financial management and reporting, investor relations, mergers & acquisitions, and corporate compliance.
 
The Company competes with other cannabis testing labs on a state by state basis. Digipath Labs is a known publicly traded cannabis testing lab. It has one location in Nevada. The Company does not currently operate in Nevada. Each of our labs compete with other laboratories in their respective states as described below.
 
The Company maintains intangible property including its brand, which it uses internally and licenses to certain laboratories. It also has consolidated customer lists and has developed proprietary laboratory methods, procedures, and software.
 
As of September 30, 2019, the Management and Corporate division has seven employees. These corporate employees include the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Science Officer, Controller, Vice President of Operations, Director of Human Resources, and Accountant.
 
2. Consulting Services
 
The Company provides advisory, product formulation, licensing and compliance services to the cannabis industry. Consulting clients are located in states that have state managed medical and/or recreational cannabis programs. The Company assists such clients with business planning, state compliance, product and process development advice, and ongoing operational support, evaluation of processes, identification of alternative solutions, formulations, or processes, recommendations of resources needed, and deliverable reports or prototype products.
 
Business advisory and compliance consulting require specialized skills in the areas of policy and compliance, cannabis industry regulations, and cannabis operations. Cannabis product formulation, custom R&D, and process optimization consulting require additional skills in chemistry and/or chemical engineering, product formulation and product development. Consulting services depends on the shared resources of corporate and laboratory personnel on an as-needed basis. The Chief Operations Officer, and/or Chief Science Officer lead advisory projects, and recruit qualified personnel from our labs, as well as outside consultants, to perform services on an as-needed basis.
 
There are many small private cannabis consulting firms and sole proprietor consultants working in the cannabis industry today. Most of our consulting clients come to us as referral business from our testing operations, or as referrals from or repeat business from our consulting clients. Therefore, we rarely encounter direct competition for our consulting services, which we currently provide as a companion or value-added service to our analytical testing services.

Specialized Skill and Knowledge
 
Our testing labs require the specialized expertise of qualified chemists and micro-biologists at each lab location. All of the Company’s laboratory technicians have undergraduate degrees in science; laboratory analysts have masters’ degrees or equivalent experience; and laboratory directors have post-graduate degrees or prior laboratory experience plus management expertise. Laboratory staff have both scientific knowledge and specialized expertise in performing analytical testing, and specifically testing cannabis and cannabis products. The labs also require specialized personnel in the areas of compliance and quality assurance.
Competitive Conditions
 
Due to prohibitions on interstate transport of cannabis in the US, cannabis labs compete on a state by state level.
 
In Oregon, according to the Oregon Liquor Licensing Commission there are approximately 20 accredited cannabis test labs, of which we owned four, and consolidated to two. Competitors in Oregon include GreenLeaf Labs, ChemHistory, Juniper Labs, and Pixis Labs. None of the Company’s competitors in Oregon have labs at multiple locations.
 
In Massachusetts, according to the Cannabis Control Commission, there are four labs, of which the Company owns one. Competing labs in Massachusetts include MCR Labs and Pro Verde.
 
In Canada, according to Health Canada, the Company competes with 33 “licensed testing companies” nationwide.
 
In California, according to the Bureau of Cannabis Control, there are currently 32 licensed cannabis laboratories. Current incumbent competitors include: Steep Hill Labs, SC Labs, PharmLabs and CW Analytical.
 
DigiPath in Nevada is the only other publicly traded lab and operates in Las Vegas, Nevada, where we do not compete.
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
Focus on the newly legalized markets in California and Massachusetts. California is projected to be the largest cannabis market in the world. In 2019, California implemented new testing requirements that require all cannabis sold in the recently regulated adult-use dispensaries be tested. This opens a substantial opportunity for EVIO to capture substantial market share of the California market. Massachusetts is also a recent addition to the roster of adult-use states and has created an immediate opportunity to perform testing, especially because of the small number of labs in the state.
 
Increase participation in the recently regulated hemp and CBD markets. With the emergence of CBD products, and a market that is expected to soon eclipse the cannabis market, we anticipate that the states, and the FDA will require that hemp-derived CBD products undergo testing. EVIO is well positioned to perform this testing.
 
Evaluate new domestic and international markets for growth. The cannabis market continues to grow as more US states and many countries implement medical and adult use cannabis programs. EVIO will continue to evaluate new markets.
 
Establish partnerships with the industry’s leading national brands and organizations. We believe that consolidation within the industry is likely. Therefore, we will focus our efforts on establishing partnerships with the companies and brands that are most likely to emerge as leaders. EVIO’s national footprint should attract the multi-state and multi-national operators that seek consistent testing and a consistent customer experience at any lab they work with.
