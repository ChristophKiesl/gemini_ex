Item 1 - Business
Company Overview
Level One Bancorp, Inc. (the "Company," "Level One," "we," "our," or "us") is the bank holding company, registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended ("BHCA"), for Level One Bank (the "Bank"), headquartered in Farmington Hills located in Oakland County, Michigan. The Company is a Michigan corporation incorporated in 2006 and a financial holding company. The Bank has grown rapidly since its founding in 2007 and is one of the largest locally-headquartered commercial banks in southeastern Michigan. This growth has been driven primarily by our entrepreneurial culture, our experienced management team and by the economic strength of our core market area in Oakland County, which, as of December 31, 2020, had the fourteenth highest median income in the United States of counties with over one million residents. As of December 31, 2020, we had $2.44 billion in assets, $1.72 billion in loans, $1.96 billion in deposits and total shareholders’ equity of $215.3 million. We generated net income of $20.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or $2.57 per diluted common share, and $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, or $2.05 per diluted common share.
In our thirteen years of operation, we have grown to 17 offices, including 9 banking centers (our full‑service branches) in Oakland County, one banking center in each of Detroit and Grand Rapids, Michigan’s two largest cities, one banking center in Sterling Heights, one banking center in Jackson, and three banking centers and a mortgage loan production office in Ann Arbor. In addition to our organic growth, we acquired Michigan Heritage Bank in 2009, Paramount Bank in 2010, Lotus Bank in 2015, and Bank of Michigan in 2016, which added to our commercial banking, retail banking and mortgage lending while expanding our product suite and staffing levels. We also acquired Ann Arbor State Bank as of January 2, 2020, which expanded our client base in Ann Arbor by adding two banking centers to our already established banking center and a mortgage production office, and another banking center in Jackson. Our aim is to continue our growth, primarily through organic growth but supplemented by opportunistic acquisitions that are additive to our franchise value.
Lending Activities
We offer a broad and growing set of lending products and related services, made up of commercial real estate loans, including construction and land development loans; commercial and industrial loans, including lines of credit, term loans, and loans under the Small Business Administration (SBA) lending program (including paycheck protection program ("PPP") loans); residential real estate loans; and consumer loans, including home equity loans, automobile loans and credit card services. We target our services to owner-managed businesses, professional firms, real estate professionals, not-for-profit businesses and 
consumers within our geographic markets who meet our underwriting standards.
We focus primarily on originating commercial and industrial loans, owner occupied commercial real estate loans and, to a lesser extent, non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans in our primary market areas, which include Oakland County, the Detroit metropolitan area, the Grand Rapids metropolitan area, and the Ann Arbor metropolitan area. We have lenders dedicated to targeting mid-sized businesses with between $5.0 million and $50.0 million of annual revenue, but we also target small businesses with annual revenue of less than $5.0 million. 
Commercial Loans. The commercial loans offered by the Bank include (i) commercial mortgages, (ii) commercial and industrial loans consisting of operating lines of credit, term loans, SBA-guaranteed loans (including PPP loans) and loans guaranteed by other loan programs such as the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) collateral support program and, in the past, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Business and Industry program; and (iii) commercial real estate construction and land development loans. Targeted customer groups include small and mid-sized business owners and operators. Another target group is professionals who are likely to build and occupy facilities at their principal employment locations.
The Bank’s commercial mortgages are used to provide construction and permanent financing for owner-occupied, retail and office buildings, and multi-family buildings. Commercial real estate secured loans are generally written on a five-year term, with amortizing periods ranging up to twenty years. Interest rates may be fixed for three to seven years, or adjustable. The Bank generally charges an origination fee for its services. We generally require personal guarantees from the principal owners of the property supported by a review of the principal owners’ personal financial statements. We attempt to limit our risk by analyzing the borrowers’ cash flow and collateral value on an ongoing basis and by an annual review of rent rolls and financial statements. The conventional loan-to-value ratio as established by an independent appraisal typically will not exceed 80% for these loans. Owner-occupied commercial real estate loans were $275.0 million, or 16.0% of the Company’s loan portfolio, and non-owner occupied commercial real estate/multi-family loans were $445.8 million, or 25.9% of the Company’s loan portfolio, as of December 31, 2020. 
Commercial and industrial loans are generally made to small to mid-sized businesses for business purposes and are supported by the cash flow of the underlying business as well as collateral of accounts receivable, inventory and/or equipment and personal guaranties from the business owners. SBA, MEDC, and USDA lending programs are utilized to enhance the credit quality of loans that already meet the requirements of the Company’s rigorous credit underwriting policies and procedures. These programs have a further benefit to the Company in terms of liquidity and potential fee income, since there is an active secondary market that will purchase the guaranteed portion of these loans at a premium. Our operating lines of credit typically are limited to a percentage of the value of the assets securing the line. Lines of credit and term loans typically are reviewed annually. Commercial and industrial loans are primarily underwritten on the basis of the borrower’s ability to service the loan from operating income. The terms of these loans vary by purpose and by type of underlying collateral. We typically make equipment loans for a term of five years or less at fixed or adjustable rates, with the loan fully amortized over the term. Loans to support working capital typically have terms not exceeding one year and are usually secured by accounts receivable, inventory and personal guarantees of the principals of the business. The interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk and loan amount and are further subject to competitive pressures, money market rates, the availability of funds and government regulations. For loans secured by accounts receivable and inventory, principal is typically repaid as the assets securing the loan are converted into cash (monitored on a monthly, quarterly or more frequent basis as determined necessary in the underwriting process), and for loans secured with other types of collateral, principal is typically due at maturity. As of December 31, 2020, commercial and industrial loans (including PPP loans) totaled approximately $685.5 million, or 39.8% of the Company’s loan portfolio.
Construction loans include commercial projects (such as multi-family housing, industrial, office and retail centers). Permanent financing is typically offered for commercial properties under construction. These loans typically have a term of less than 18 months, floating interest rates and commitment fees. Construction loans for investment real estate are made to developers who have an established record of successful project completion and loan repayment. Loan repayment for owner occupied transactions is generally from permanent financing with either the Bank or a qualified mortgage lender. The conventional loan-to-value ratio as established by independent appraisal typically is limited to 80% or less for owner occupied and 75% or less for non-owner occupied real estate. Loan proceeds are disbursed based on the percentage of completion and only after an experienced construction lender or third-party inspector has inspected the project, with construction monitoring handled by the Bank’s Credit Administration department, which ensures title policies are updated for each construction draw. At December 31, 2020, we had in $82.5 million construction loans outstanding, representing 4.8% of the Company’s loan portfolio, with $56.9 million in undisbursed commitments. 
Residential Real Estate. We originate both fixed-rate loans and adjustable-rate loans in our residential lending program. Generally, these loans are originated to meet the requirements of the Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae"), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac"), Federal Housing Administration ("FHA"), Veterans Affairs 
("VA") and jumbo loans for sale in the secondary market to investors. We typically sell our long term fixed rate and retain our adjustable loan originations. We generally underwrite our one- to four-family loans based on the applicant’s employment, debt to income levels, credit history and the appraised value of the subject property. Generally, we lend up to 80% of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price for one- to four-family conforming residential loans. In situations where we grant a residential first mortgage loan with a loan-to-value ratio in excess of 80%, we generally require private mortgage insurance in order to reduce our exposure to 80% or less. Properties securing our one- to four-family loans are generally appraised by independent appraisers selected by our appraisal management companies conforming with appraisal independent compliance guidelines. We require our borrowers to obtain title and hazard insurance, and flood insurance, if necessary, in an amount equal to the regulatory maximum. Fixed rate loans generally are offered on a fully amortizing basis for terms ranging from 10 to 30 years at interest rates and fees that reflect current secondary market pricing. Most adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) products offered adjust annually after an initial period ranging from one to ten years, subject to a limitation on the annual change of 1.0% to 2.0% and a lifetime limitation of 5.0% to 6.0%. Beginning in 2021, these ARM products most frequently adjust based upon the 30-day average yield of the SOFR index adjusted to a constant maturity of six months plus a margin or spread above the index. Generally, ARM loans held in our portfolio do not allow for interest-only payments nor negative amortization of principal and carry allowable prepayment restrictions. The Bank also makes a limited amount of loans secured by second mortgages on residential real estate. Second residential mortgages may have a loan to value of up 80% when combined with the first mortgage; however exceptions can be made based on credit capacity, collateral and the banking relationship. Also included in residential real estate loans are home equity lines of credit. Home equity lines of credit generally have a loan to value ratio of up to 90% at the time of origination when combined with the first mortgage. In 2020, the Bank temporarily restricted the loan to value ratio to 80% at the time of origination when combined with a first mortgage due to the uncertainty related to COVID-19. The majority of these loans are secured by a first or second mortgage on residential property. Home equity lines of credit allow for a 10-year draw period, followed by a 10-year repayment period, and the interest rate is generally tied to the prime rate as published by the Wall Street Journal and may include a margin. As of December 31, 2020, residential loans totaled approximately $315.5 million, or 18.3% of the Company’s loan portfolio, of which $42.4 million were home equity lines of credit.
Consumer Loans. Consumer loans offered by the Bank include personal installment and auto loans and credit cards through a third-party provider. Personal lines of credit generally have maturities from one to five years and variable interest rates. Personal unsecured loans are available to creditworthy bank customers with limits determined on a loan by loan basis. Credit reports and industry standard debt-to-income ratios or less are used to qualify borrowers. As of December 31, 2020, consumer loans totaled approximately $1.7 million, or 0.1% of the Company’s loan portfolio.
Loan Policy and Approval. Loan authority is delegated by the Directors Loan Committee. The Bank does not provide loan authority to any one individual, but takes a risk management approach based on aggregate credit exposure and risk grading. Aggregate exposure less than $2.0 million requires multi-signature approval. The Management Loan Committee has approval authority up to $6.0 million. All other loans require approval by the Directors Loan Committee. Each loan request requires some level of credit approval. Under applicable federal and state law, the Bank’s permissible loans to one borrower are limited to $56.1 million in the aggregate as of December 31, 2020, subject to two-thirds board approval. 
Deposit Services. The Bank offers a full range of deposit services insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), including (i) commercial checking and small business checking products, (ii) retirement accounts such as Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), and (iii) retail deposit services such as certificates of deposits, money market accounts, savings accounts, checking account products and Automated Teller Machines (ATMs). The Bank also offers debit cards and internet banking as well commercial depository (treasury management) services.
The Bank’s business strategy concentrates heavily on the generation of “core” deposits, which are generally defined as demand deposit accounts, money market accounts, negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts, and time deposit accounts of less than $250 thousand. The Bank focuses its deposit efforts on cash rich businesses such as insurance companies, insurance agents, trade associations, title and escrow companies, real estate offices, churches and professionals such as physicians, attorneys and other services providers. The Bank has implemented deposit gathering strategies and tactics to attract and retain deposits utilizing technology to deliver treasury management services (e.g. remote deposit capture, lock box, and electronic bill payments) in addition to the traditional generation of deposit relationships in conjunction with its lending activities. 
In addition, as of December 31, 2020, the Bank had $29.3 million of brokered deposits and deposits obtained through the use of internet listing services (approximately 1.5% of total deposits).
In addition, we generate fee income through our money services business clients (MSB), which provide cash management services for small, locally-owned cash intensive businesses. We intend to continue to grow this line of business, which we acquired in 2016 through our Bank of Michigan acquisition.
Competition
The financial services industry is highly competitive as we compete for loans, deposits and customer relationships in our market. Competition involves efforts to retain current clients, make new loans and obtain new deposits, increase the scope and sophistication of services offered and offer competitive interest rates paid on deposits and charged on loans. Within our branch footprint, we primarily face competition from national, regional and other local financial institutions that have established branch networks throughout our market areas, giving them visible retail presence to customers.
In mortgage banking, we face competition from a wide range of national financial institutions, regional and local community banks, as well as credit unions and national mortgage companies. In commercial banking, we face competition to underwrite loans to sound, stable businesses and real estate projects at competitive price levels that make sense for our business and risk profile. Our major commercial bank competitors include larger national, regional and local financial institutions that may have the ability to make loans on larger projects than we can or provide a larger mix of product offerings. We also compete with smaller local financial institutions that may have aggressive pricing and unique terms on various types of loans and, increasingly, financial technology platforms that offer their products exclusively through web-based portals.
In retail banking, we primarily compete with national, regional, and local banks that have visible retail presence and personnel in our market areas. The primary factors driving competition in consumer banking are customer service, interest rates, fees charged, branch locations and hours of operation and the range of products offered. We compete for deposits by advertising, offering competitive interest rates and seeking to provide a higher level of personal service. We also face competition from non-traditional alternatives to banks such as credit unions, money centers, money market mutual funds and cash management accounts.
We believe our ability to provide a flexible, sophisticated product offering and an efficient process to our customers allows us to stay competitive in the financial services environment. We believe our local presence and hands-on approach enables us to provide a high level of service that our customers value.
Our Market Areas
        We believe the demographics of our market areas provide strong growth opportunities for our loan portfolio and deposits. The following chart, which is based on data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, shows our share of the deposits in our market areas as of June 30, 2020, which is the most recent data available.

Human Capital Resources
Level One’s community banking strategy relies heavily on the personal relationships and the quality of service provided by team members. Accordingly, Level One aims to attract, develop and retain team members who can drive financial and strategic growth objectives and build long-term shareholder value. Key items related to Level One’s human capital resources are described below.
Structure. As of December 31, 2020, Level One had 282 full-time equivalent team members, primarily located in Michigan. Level One’s Chief Human Resources Officer reports directly to the Chairman, President and CEO and manages all aspects of the team member experience, including talent acquisition, education and development, talent management, and compensation and benefits. None of our employees are a party to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements.
The Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee are updated on Level One’s talent development and human capital management strategies, with a focus on providing competitive compensation and benefit plans.
Productivity. Level One carefully manages the size of its workforce and reallocates resources as needed. As of December 31, 2020, Level One’s total headcount was 8% higher than the preceding year-end mostly due to the acquisition of Ann Arbor State Bank that occurred on January 2, 2020. The addition of these new team members enhanced Level One’s presence and opportunity in its southeast Michigan market, Ann Arbor. Additionally, Level One team members produced record high mortgage volumes and outpaced its peers in supporting the PPP loan program for its customer base while providing approximately 900 PPP loans to new clients.
Diversity. Level One is committed to providing a safe and engaging environment for all team members. Level One has been recognized for eight years in a row as one of Metro Detroit's Best and Brightest Companies to Work for by MichBusiness. Level One believes this was driven largely by the commitment of its diverse talent who have ready access to decision makers. Level One believes that it meets all the requirements for a diverse workforce as evidenced by a strong Affirmative Action Plan and its retention of diverse talent. As an area of focus for Level One in 2020, Level One took a particular interest in the effect of societal turbulence on our minority team members and conducted an honest and sincere conversation about race relations with these team members. The team members then engaged in developing a path to enhance the engagement with Level One through further dialogue and programmatic support.
Compensation and Benefits. Level One strives to provide pay, benefits, and services that help meet the varying needs of its team members. Compensation and benefits include market-competitive pay, retirement programs, broad-based bonuses, health and welfare benefits, financial counseling, paid time off, family leave and flexible work schedules. Level One periodically reviews compensation and benefits by grade level and position to ensure similar positions are paid comparatively and to ensure that Level One has a competitive and valuable offering to meet the well-being and needs of its team members.
Development and Retention. Level One measures the success of its talent acquisition strategy on speed and quality of acquisition, retention, and overall performance metrics. Sourcing strategies are reviewed to ensure that the best talent is attracted to Level One.
Level One has also created internal programs to support the development and retention of its team members, including an internal leadership development program designed to train emerging leaders, enhanced training for retail bank team members, and personality-type training for all team members to better understand themselves and others. Additionally, specially focused development plans were created for high potential and key talent to ensure learning through a variety of experiences. Level One also supports its team members’ involvement in external development programs. For example, each year, women are sponsored to attend the MBA Women’s Forum and others are supported through attendance in webinars and conferences.
Team member turnover for 2020 was 13%. In 2020, Level One conducted its second enterprise-wide team member engagement survey with an 84% participation rate. Two councils representing team members from across the organization were formed to address the feedback.
Culture and Core Values. Level One leadership believes the foundation of its culture is built on six core values: Passion, Relationship Focused, Humble Yet Confident, Hardest Job You’ll Ever Love, Do What’s Best, and Results Matter. These core values are embedded in all team members’ performance reviews and talent discussions and are present in all interviews, selection decisions and promotions. The energy and dedication to Level One’s entrepreneurial spirit are driven by these core values and are evidenced by positive engagement survey results.
COVID-19. In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, over 75% of Level One’s team members were able to work remotely. Level One also provided 10 days of paid time off for team members exposed to COVID-19 or who were diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the passing of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. Level One adopted each of the provisions of the CARES Act relating to 401(k) loan and withdrawal relief and Level One participated in no-cost health care benefits pertaining to COVID-19 along with free telehealth visits. Level One did not reduce salaries or any other benefits during this time to support our team members through the pandemic.

Supervision and Regulation
General 
FDIC-insured institutions, their holding companies and their affiliates are extensively regulated under federal and state law. As a result, our growth and earnings performance may be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by the requirements of federal and state statutes and by the regulations and policies of various bank regulatory agencies, including the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services (the “DIFS”), the FDIC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”), and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”). Furthermore, taxation laws administered by the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities, accounting rules developed by the FASB, securities laws administered by the SEC and state securities authorities, and anti-money laundering laws enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”) have an impact on our business. The effect of these statutes, regulations, regulatory policies and accounting rules are significant to our operations and results.
Federal and state banking laws impose a comprehensive system of supervision, regulation and enforcement on the operations of FDIC-insured institutions, their holding companies and affiliates that is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC-insured deposits and depositors of banks, rather than shareholders. These laws, and the regulations of the bank regulatory agencies issued under them, affect, among other things, the scope of our business, the kinds and amounts of investments the Company and the Bank may make, required capital levels relative to assets, the nature and amount of collateral for loans, the establishment of branches, the ability to merge, consolidate and acquire, dealings with the Company’s and the Bank’s insiders and affiliates and our payment of dividends. In reaction to the global financial crisis and particularly following the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), we experienced heightened regulatory requirements and scrutiny. Although the reforms primarily targeted systemically important financial service providers, their influence filtered down in varying degrees to community banks over time and caused our compliance and risk management processes, and the costs thereof, to increase. Then, in May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (“Regulatory Relief Act”) was enacted by Congress in part to provide regulatory relief for community banks and their holding companies. To that end, the law eliminated questions about the applicability of certain Dodd-Frank Act reforms to community bank systems, including relieving us of any requirement to engage in mandatory stress tests, maintain a risk committee or comply with the Volcker Rule’s complicated prohibitions on proprietary trading and ownership of private funds. We believe these reforms are favorable to our operations. 
The supervisory framework for U.S. banking organizations subjects banks and bank holding companies to regular examination by their respective regulatory agencies, which results in examination reports and ratings that are not publicly available and that can impact the conduct and growth of their business. These examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but also capital levels, asset quality and risk, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors. The regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity where the agencies determine, among other things, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations.
The following is a summary of the material elements of the supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to the Company and the Bank, beginning with a discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the banking industry. It does not describe all of the statutes, regulations and regulatory policies that apply, nor does it restate all of the requirements of those that are described. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provision.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The federal bank regulatory agencies, along with their state counterparts, have issued a steady stream of guidance responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and have taken a number of unprecedented steps to help banks navigate the pandemic and mitigate its impact. These include, without limitation: requiring banks to focus on business continuity and pandemic planning; adding pandemic scenarios to stress testing; encouraging bank use of capital buffers and reserves in lending programs; permitting certain regulatory reporting extensions; reducing margin requirements on swaps; permitting certain otherwise prohibited investments in investment funds; issuing guidance to encourage banks to work with customers affected by the pandemic and encourage loan workouts; and providing credit under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) for certain pandemic-related loans, investments and public service. Because of the need for social distancing measures, the agencies revamped the manner in which they conducted periodic examinations of their regulated institutions, including making greater use of off-site reviews. 
Moreover, the Federal Reserve issued guidance encouraging banking institutions to utilize its discount window for loans and intraday credit extended by its Reserve Banks to help households and businesses impacted by the pandemic and announced numerous funding facilities. The FDIC also has acted to mitigate the deposit insurance assessment effects of participating in the PPP and the Federal Reserve’s PPP Liquidity Facility and Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility. 
Reference is made to “Item 1A. Risk Factors — COVID-19 Risks” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Recent Developments — Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic” for information on 
the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), PPP program and the Federal Reserve’s lending facilities and for discussions of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, information as to selected topics, such as the impact on capital requirements, dividend payments, reserves and CRA, is contained in the relevant sections of this Supervision and Regulation discussion provided below. 
The Role of Capital 
Regulatory capital represents the net assets of a banking organization available to absorb losses. Because of the risks attendant to their business, FDIC-insured institutions are generally required to hold more capital than other businesses, which directly affects our earnings capabilities. While capital has historically been one of the key measures of the financial health of both bank holding companies and banks, its role became fundamentally more important in the wake of the global financial crisis, as the banking regulators recognized that the amount and quality of capital held by banks prior to the crisis was insufficient to absorb losses during periods of severe stress. Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III, discussed below, establish capital standards for banks and bank holding companies that are meaningfully more stringent than those in place previously.
Capital Levels. Banks have been required to hold minimum levels of capital based on guidelines established by the bank regulatory agencies since 1983. The minimums have been expressed in terms of ratios of “capital” divided by “total assets”. The capital guidelines for U.S. banks beginning in 1989 have been based upon international capital accords (known as “Basel” rules) adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a committee of central banks and bank supervisors that acts as the primary global standard-setter for prudential regulation, as implemented by the U.S. bank regulatory agencies on an interagency basis. The accords recognized that bank assets for the purpose of the capital ratio calculations needed to be risk weighted (the theory being that riskier assets should require more capital) and that off-balance sheet exposures needed to be factored in the calculations. Following the global financial crisis, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision, the oversight body of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, announced agreement on a strengthened set of capital requirements for banking organizations around the world, known as Basel III, to address deficiencies recognized in connection with the global financial crisis. 
The Basel III Rule. In July 2013, the U.S. federal banking agencies approved the implementation of the Basel III regulatory capital reforms in pertinent part, and, at the same time, promulgated rules effecting certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Basel III Rule”). In contrast to capital requirements historically, which were in the form of guidelines, Basel III was released in the form of binding regulations by each of the regulatory agencies. The Basel III Rule increased the required quantity and quality of capital and required more detailed categories of risk weighting of riskier, more opaque assets. For nearly every class of assets, the Basel III Rule requires a more complex, detailed and calibrated assessment of risk in the calculation of risk weightings. The Basel III Rule is applicable to all banking organizations that are subject to minimum capital requirements, including federal and state banks and savings and loan associations, as well as to bank and savings and loan holding companies, other than “small bank holding companies” (generally certain holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $3 billion, like the Company) and certain qualifying banking organizations that may elect a simplified framework (which we have not done). Thus, the Bank is currently subject to the Basel III Rule as described below.
Not only did the Basel III Rule increase most of the required minimum capital ratios in effect prior to January 1, 2015, but, in requiring that forms of capital be of higher quality to absorb loss, it introduced the concept of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, which consists primarily of common stock, related surplus (net of Treasury stock), retained earnings, and Common Equity Tier 1 minority interests subject to certain regulatory adjustments. The Basel III Rule also changed the definition of capital by establishing more stringent criteria that instruments must meet to be considered Additional Tier 1 Capital (primarily non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock that meets certain requirements) and Tier 2 Capital (primarily other types of preferred stock and subordinated debt, subject to limitations). The Basel III Rule also constrained the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets, and deferred tax assets in capital and required deductions from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital in the event that such assets exceeded a percentage of a banking institution’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. 
The Basel III Rule required minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2015, as follows: 
•A ratio of minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital equal to 4.5% of risk-weighted assets;
•A ratio of minimum Tier 1 Capital equal to 6% of risk-weighted assets; 
•A continuation of the minimum required amount of Total Capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) at 8% of risk-weighted assets; and
•A minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total quarterly average assets equal to 4% in all circumstances.
In addition, institutions that seek the freedom to make capital distributions (including for dividends and repurchases of stock) and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers without restriction must also maintain 2.5% in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital attributable to a capital conservation buffer. The purpose of the conservation buffer is to ensure that banking institutions maintain a buffer of capital that can be used to absorb losses during periods of financial and economic stress. Factoring in the conservation buffer increases the minimum ratios depicted above to 7% for Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, 
8.5% for Tier 1 Capital and 10.5% for Total Capital. The federal bank regulators released a joint statement in response to the COVID-19 pandemic reminding the industry that capital and liquidity buffers were meant to give banks the means to support the economy in adverse situations, and that the agencies would support banks that use the buffers for that purpose if undertaken in a safe and sound manner. 
Well-Capitalized Requirements. The ratios described above are minimum standards in order for banking organizations to be considered “adequately capitalized.” Bank regulatory agencies uniformly encourage banks to hold more capital and be “well-capitalized” and, to that end, federal law and regulations provide various incentives for banking organizations to maintain regulatory capital at levels in excess of minimum regulatory requirements. For example, a banking organization that is well-capitalized may: (i) qualify for exemptions from prior notice or application requirements otherwise applicable to certain types of activities; (ii) qualify for expedited processing of other required notices or applications; and (iii) accept, roll-over or renew brokered deposits. Higher capital levels could also be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual banking organizations. For example, the Federal Reserve’s capital guidelines contemplate that additional capital may be required to take adequate account of, among other things, interest rate risk, or the risks posed by concentrations of credit, nontraditional activities or securities trading activities. Further, any banking organization experiencing or anticipating significant growth would be expected to maintain capital ratios, including tangible capital positions (i.e., Tier 1 Capital less all intangible assets), well above the minimum levels.
Under the capital regulations of the Federal Reserve for the Company and the FDIC for the Bank, in order to be well‑capitalized, we must maintain:
•A Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio to risk-weighted assets of 6.5% or more; 
•A ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 8% or more; 
•A ratio of Total Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 10% or more; and 
•A leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total adjusted average quarterly assets of 5% or greater.
It is possible under the Basel III Rule to be well-capitalized while remaining out of compliance with the capital conservation buffer discussed above.
As of December 31, 2020: (i) the Bank was not subject to a directive from DIFS or FDIC to increase its capital and (ii) the Bank was well-capitalized, as defined by FDIC regulations. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had regulatory capital in excess of the Federal Reserve’s requirements and met the Basel III Rule requirements to be well-capitalized. We are also in compliance with the capital conservation buffer.
Prompt Corrective Action. The concept of an institution being “well-capitalized” is part of a regulatory enforcement regime that provides the federal banking regulators with broad power to take “prompt corrective action” to resolve the problems of institutions based on the capital level of each particular institution. The extent of the regulators’ powers depends on whether the institution in question is “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized,” in each case as defined by regulation. Depending upon the capital category to which an institution is assigned, the regulators’ corrective powers include: (i) requiring the institution to submit a capital restoration plan; (ii) limiting the institution’s asset growth and restricting its activities; (iii) requiring the institution to issue additional capital stock (including additional voting stock) or to sell itself; (iv) restricting transactions between the institution and its affiliates; (v) restricting the interest rate that the institution may pay on deposits; (vi) ordering a new election of directors of the institution; (vii) requiring that senior executive officers or directors be dismissed; (viii) prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks; (ix) requiring the institution to divest certain subsidiaries; (x) prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt; and (xi) ultimately, appointing a receiver for the institution.
Community Bank Capital Simplification. Community banks have long raised concerns with bank regulators about the regulatory burden, complexity, and costs associated with certain provisions of the Basel III Rule. In response, Congress provided an “off-ramp” for institutions, like us, with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. Section 201 of the Regulatory Relief Act instructed the federal banking regulators to establish a single “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” (“CBLR”) of between 8 and 10%. Under the final rule, a community banking organization is eligible to elect the new framework if it has: less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, limited amounts of certain assets and off-balance sheet exposures, and a CBLR greater than 9%. The bank regulatory agencies temporarily lowered the CBLR to 8% as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We may elect the CBLR framework at any time but have not currently determined to do so.
Regulation and Supervision of the Company
General. As the sole shareholder of the Bank, we are a bank holding company. As a bank holding company, we are registered with, and is subject to regulation supervision and enforcement by, the Federal Reserve under the BHCA. We are legally obligated to act as a source of financial strength to the Bank and to commit resources to support the Bank in circumstances where we might not otherwise do so. Under the BHCA, we are subject to periodic examination by the Federal 
Reserve. We are required to file with the Federal Reserve periodic reports of our operations and such additional information regarding us and our subsidiaries as the Federal Reserve may require.
Acquisitions, Activities and Financial Holding Company Election. The primary purpose of a bank holding company is to control and manage banks. The BHCA generally requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve for any merger involving a bank holding company or any acquisition by a bank holding company of another bank or bank holding company. Subject to certain conditions (including deposit concentration limits established by the BHCA), the Federal Reserve may allow a bank holding company to acquire banks located in any state of the United States. In approving interstate acquisitions, the Federal Reserve is required to give effect to applicable state law limitations on the aggregate amount of deposits that may be held by the acquiring bank holding company and its FDIC-insured institution affiliates in the state in which the target bank is located (provided that those limits do not discriminate against out-of-state institutions or their holding companies) and state laws that require that the target bank have been in existence for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years) before being acquired by an out-of-state bank holding company. Furthermore, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, bank holding companies must be well-capitalized and well-managed in order to effect interstate mergers or acquisitions. For a discussion of the capital requirements, see “—The Role of Capital” above.
The BHCA generally prohibits us from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank and from engaging in any business other than that of banking, managing and controlling banks or furnishing services to banks and their subsidiaries. This general prohibition is subject to a number of exceptions. The principal exception allows bank holding companies to engage in, and to own shares of companies engaged in, certain businesses found by the Federal Reserve prior to November 11, 1999 to be “so closely related to banking ... as to be a proper incident thereto.” This authority permits us to engage in a variety of banking-related businesses, including the ownership and operation of a savings association, or any entity engaged in consumer finance, equipment leasing, the operation of a computer service bureau (including software development) and mortgage banking and brokerage services. The BHCA does not place territorial restrictions on the domestic activities of nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies. 
Additionally, bank holding companies that meet certain eligibility requirements prescribed by the BHCA and elect to operate as financial holding companies may engage in, or own shares in companies engaged in, a wider range of nonbanking activities, including securities and insurance underwriting and sales, merchant banking and any other activity that the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines by regulation or order is financial in nature or incidental to any such financial activity or that the Federal Reserve determines by order to be complementary to any such financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of FDIC-insured institutions or the financial system generally. We have elected to operate as a financial holding company. In order to maintain our status as a financial holding company, the Company and the Bank must be well-capitalized, well-managed, and the Bank must have a least a satisfactory CRA rating. If the Federal Reserve determines that either the Company or the Bank is not well-capitalized or well-managed, the Federal Reserve will provide a period of time in which to achieve compliance, but during the period of noncompliance, the Federal Reserve may place any additional limitations on us that it deems appropriate. Furthermore, if non-compliance is based on the failure of the Bank to achieve a satisfactory CRA rating, we would not be able to commence any new financial activities or acquire a company that engages in such activities. 
Change in Control. Federal law prohibits any person or company from acquiring “control” of an FDIC-insured depository institution or its holding company without prior notice to the appropriate federal bank regulator. “Control” is conclusively presumed to exist upon the acquisition of 25% or more of the outstanding voting securities of a bank or bank holding company, but may arise under certain circumstances between 10% and 24.99% ownership.
Capital Requirements. As of the date of this filing, the Federal Reserve has not requested that the Company report consolidated regulatory capital, recognizing the exemption under the Federal Reserve’s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement applicable to holding companies with less than $3 billion in total assets (as long as they do not: engage in significant nonbanking activities, conduct significant off-balance sheet activities or have a material amount of debt or equity securities registered with the SEC). Unless the Federal Reserve determines otherwise, we are considered well-capitalized, as long as the Bank is well-capitalized. For a discussion of capital requirements, see “—The Role of Capital” above. 
Dividend Payments. Our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders may be affected by both general corporate law considerations and policies of the Federal Reserve applicable to bank holding companies. As a Michigan corporation, we are subject to the Michigan Business Corporation Act, as amended, which prohibits us from paying a dividend if, after giving effect to the dividend we would not be able to pay our debts as the debts become due in the usual course of business, or our total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus, the amount that would be needed, if we were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution.
As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends to shareholders if: (i) the company’s net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) the 
prospective rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) the company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. These factors have come into consideration in the industry as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Federal Reserve also possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations. Among these powers is the ability to proscribe the payment of dividends by banks and bank holding companies. In addition, under the Basel III Rule, institutions that seek the freedom to pay dividends have to maintain 2.5% in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital attributable to the capital conservation buffer. See “—The Role of Capital” above.
Monetary Policy. The monetary policy of the Federal Reserve has a significant effect on the operating results of financial or bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, and this is evidenced in its reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the tools available to the Federal Reserve to affect the money supply are open market transactions in U.S. government securities and changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings. These means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.
Federal Securities Regulation. Our common stock is registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Exchange Act. Consequently, we are subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading and other restrictions and requirements of the SEC under the Exchange Act.
Corporate Governance. The Dodd-Frank Act addressed many investor protection, corporate governance and executive compensation matters that will affect most U.S. publicly traded companies. The Dodd-Frank Act increased shareholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give shareholders a nonbinding vote on executive compensation and so-called “golden parachute” payments, and authorizing the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow shareholders to nominate and solicit voters for their own candidates using a company’s proxy materials. The legislation also directed the Federal Reserve to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to executives of bank holding companies, regardless of whether such companies are publicly traded.
Supervision and Regulation of the Bank
General.  The Bank is a Michigan-chartered bank. The deposit accounts of the Bank are insured by the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) to the maximum extent provided under federal law and FDIC regulations, currently $250,000 per insured depositor category. As a Michigan-chartered FDIC-insured bank, the Bank is subject to the examination, supervision, reporting and enforcement requirements of the DIFS, the chartering authority for Michigan banks, and the FDIC, designated by federal law as the primary federal regulator of insured state banks that, like the Bank, are not members of the Federal Reserve. 
Deposit Insurance. As an FDIC-insured institution, the Bank is required to pay deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC. The FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system whereby FDIC-insured institutions pay insurance premiums at rates based on their risk classification. For institutions like the Bank that are not considered large and highly complex banking organizations, assessments are now based on examination ratings and financial ratios. The total base assessment rates currently range from 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points. At least semi-annually, the FDIC updates its loss and income projections for the DIF and, if needed, increases or decreases the assessment rates, following notice and comment on proposed rulemaking. 
The reserve ratio is the FDIC insurance fund balance divided by estimated insured deposits. The Dodd-Frank Act altered the minimum reserve ratio of the DIF, increasing the minimum from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits. The reserve ratio reached 1.36% as of September 30, 2018, exceeding the statutory required minimum. As a result, the FDIC provided assessment credits to insured depository institutions, like the Bank, with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion for the portion of their regular assessments that contributed to growth in the reserve ratio between 1.15% and 1.35%. The FDIC applied the small bank credits for quarterly assessment periods beginning July 1, 2019. However, the reserve ratio then fell to 1.30% in 2020 as a result of extraordinary insured deposit growth caused by an unprecedented inflow of more than $1 trillion in estimated insured deposits in the first half of 2020, stemming mainly from the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the FDIC could have ceased the small bank credits, it waived the requirement that the reserve ratio be at least 1.35% for full remittance of the remaining assessment credits, and it refunded all small bank credits as of September 30, 2020. 
Supervisory Assessments. All Michigan-chartered banks are required to pay supervisory assessments to the DIFS to fund the operations of that agency. The amount of the assessment is calculated on the basis of the Bank’s total assets. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Bank paid supervisory assessments to the DIFS totaling approximately $243 thousand. 
Capital Requirements. Banks are generally required to maintain capital levels in excess of other businesses. For a discussion of capital requirements, see “—The Role of Capital” above.
Liquidity Requirements. Liquidity is a measure of the ability and ease with which bank assets may be converted to cash. Liquid assets are those that can be converted to cash quickly if needed to meet financial obligations. To remain viable, FDIC-
insured institutions must have enough liquid assets to meet their near-term obligations, such as withdrawals by depositors. Because the global financial crisis was in part a liquidity crisis, Basel III also includes a liquidity framework that requires FDIC-insured institutions to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests. One test, referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), is designed to ensure that the banking entity has an adequate stock of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets that can be converted easily and immediately in private markets into cash to meet liquidity needs for a 30-calendar day liquidity stress scenario. The other test, known as the net stable funding ratio (NSFR), is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of FDIC-insured institutions over a one-year horizon. These tests provide an incentive for banks and holding companies to increase their holdings in Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets, increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source and rely on stable funding like core deposits (in lieu of brokered deposits).
In addition to liquidity guidelines already in place, the federal bank regulatory agencies implemented the Basel III LCR in September 2014, which requires large financial firms to hold levels of liquid assets sufficient to protect against constraints on their funding during times of financial turmoil, and in 2016 proposed implementation of the NSFR. While these rules do not, and will not, apply to the Bank, it continues to review its liquidity risk management policies in light of developments.
Dividend Payments. The primary source of funds for the Company is dividends from the Bank. Under the Michigan Banking Code, the Bank cannot declare or pay a cash dividend or dividend in kind unless it will have a surplus amounting to not less than 20% of its capital after payment of the dividend. In addition, the Bank may pay dividends only out of net income then on hand, after deducting its bad debts. Further, the Bank may not declare or pay a dividend until cumulative dividends on preferred stock, if any, are paid in full. 
The payment of dividends by any FDIC-insured institution is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations, and a FDIC-insured institution generally is prohibited from paying any dividends if, following payment thereof, the institution would be undercapitalized. As described above, the Bank exceeded its capital requirements under applicable guidelines as of December 31, 2020. Notwithstanding the availability of funds for dividends, however, the FDIC and the DIFS may prohibit the payment of dividends by the Bank if either or both determine such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. In addition, under the Basel III Rule, institutions that seek the freedom to pay dividends have to maintain the capital conservation buffer. See “—The Role of Capital” above.
State Bank Investments and Activities. The Bank is permitted to make investments and engage in activities directly or through subsidiaries as authorized by Michigan law. However, under federal law and FDIC regulations, FDIC-insured state banks are prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from making or retaining equity investments of a type, or in an amount, that are not permissible for a national bank. Federal law and FDIC regulations also prohibit FDIC-insured state banks and their subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, from engaging as principal in any activity that is not permitted for a national bank unless the bank meets, and continues to meet, its minimum regulatory capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity would not pose a significant risk to the DIF. These restrictions have not had, and are not currently expected to have, a material impact on the operations of the Bank.
Insider Transactions. The Bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on “covered transactions” between the Bank and its “affiliates.” We are an affiliate of the Bank for purposes of these restrictions, and covered transactions subject to the restrictions include extensions of credit to the Company, investments in the stock or other securities of the Company and the acceptance of the stock or other securities of the Company as collateral for loans made by the Bank. The Dodd-Frank Act enhanced the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates, including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained.
Certain limitations and reporting requirements are also placed on extensions of credit by the Bank to its directors and officers, to directors and officers of the Company and our subsidiaries, to our principal shareholders and to “related interests” of such directors, officers and principal shareholders. In addition, federal law and regulations may affect the terms upon which any person who is a director or officer of the Company or the Bank, or a principal shareholder of the Company, may obtain credit from banks with which the Bank maintains a correspondent relationship.
Safety and Soundness Standards/Risk Management. The federal banking agencies have adopted operational and managerial standards to promote the safety and soundness of FDIC-insured institutions. The standards apply to internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, asset quality and earnings.
In general, the safety and soundness standards prescribe the goals to be achieved in each area, and each institution is responsible for establishing its own procedures to achieve those goals. While regulatory standards do not have the force of law, if an institution operates in an unsafe and unsound manner, the FDIC-insured institution’s primary federal regulator may require the institution to submit a plan for achieving and maintaining compliance. If an FDIC-insured institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan, or fails in any material respect to implement a compliance plan that has been accepted by its 
primary federal regulator, the regulator is required to issue an order directing the institution to cure the deficiency. Until the deficiency cited in the regulator’s order is cured, the regulator may restrict the FDIC-insured institution’s rate of growth, require the FDIC-insured institution to increase its capital, restrict the rates the institution pays on deposits or require the institution to take any action the regulator deems appropriate under the circumstances. Noncompliance with safety and soundness may also constitute grounds for other enforcement action by the federal bank regulatory agencies, including cease and desist orders and civil money penalty assessments.
During the past decade, the bank regulatory agencies have increasingly emphasized the importance of sound risk management processes and strong internal controls when evaluating the activities of the FDIC-insured institutions they supervise. Properly managing risks has been identified as critical to the conduct of safe and sound banking activities and has become even more important as new technologies, product innovation, and the size and speed of financial transactions have changed the nature of banking markets. The agencies have identified a spectrum of risks facing a banking institution including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity, operational, legal and reputational risk. The federal bank regulators have identified key risk themes for 2021 as: credit risk management given projected weaker economic conditions and commercial and residential real estate concentration risk management. The agencies will also be monitoring banks for their transition away from LIBOR as a reference rate, compliance risk management related to COVID-19 pandemic-related activities, Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering compliance, cybersecurity, planning for and implementation of the CECL accounting standard, and CRA performance. The Bank is expected to have active board and senior management oversight; adequate policies, procedures and limits; adequate risk measurement, monitoring and management information systems; and comprehensive internal controls.
Privacy and Cybersecurity. The Bank is subject to many U.S. federal and state laws and regulations governing requirements for maintaining policies and procedures to protect non-public confidential information of their customers. These laws require the Bank to periodically disclose its privacy policies and practices relating to sharing such information and permit consumers to opt out of their ability to share information with unaffiliated third parties under certain circumstances. They also impact the Bank’s ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes, or to contact customers with marketing offers. In addition, as a part of its operational risk mitigation, the Bank is required to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information and to require the same of its service providers. These security and privacy policies and procedures are in effect across all business lines and geographic locations.
Branching Authority. Michigan banks, such as the Bank, have the authority under Michigan law to establish branches anywhere in the State of Michigan, subject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals. The establishment of new interstate branches has historically been permitted only in those states the laws of which expressly authorize such expansion. The Dodd-Frank Act permits well-capitalized and well-managed banks to establish de novo interstate branches without impediments. Federal law permits state and national banks to merge with banks in other states subject to: (i) regulatory approval; (ii) federal and state deposit concentration limits; and (iii) state law limitations requiring the merging bank to have been in existence for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years) prior to the merger. 
Transaction Account Reserves. Federal law requires FDIC-insured institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts) to provide liquidity. Reserves are maintained on deposit at the Federal Reserve Banks. The reserve requirements are subject to annual adjustment by the Federal Reserve, and, for 2020, the Federal Reserve had determined that the first $16.9 million of otherwise reservable balances had a zero percent reserve requirement; for transaction accounts aggregating between $16.9 million to $127.5 million, the reserve requirement was 3% of those transaction account balances; and for net transaction accounts in excess of $127.5 million, the reserve requirement was 10% of the aggregate amount of total transaction account balances in excess of $127.5 million. However, in March 2020, in an unprecedented move, the Federal Reserve announced that the banking system had ample reserves, and, as reserve requirements no longer played a significant role in this regime, it reduced all reserve tranches to zero percent, thereby freeing banks from the reserve maintenance requirement. The action permits the Bank to loan or invest funds that were previously unavailable. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it expects to continue to operate in an ample reserves regime for the foreseeable future. 
Community Reinvestment Act Requirements. The CRA requires the Bank to have a continuing and affirmative obligation in a safe and sound manner to help meet the credit needs of the entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Federal regulators regularly assess the Bank’s record of meeting the credit needs of its communities. Applications for additional acquisitions would be affected by the evaluation of the Bank’s effectiveness in meeting its CRA requirements.
Anti-Money Laundering. The USA PATRIOT Act is designed to deny terrorists and criminals the ability to obtain access to the U.S. financial system and has significant implications for FDIC-insured institutions, brokers, dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money. The USA PATRIOT Act, along with other legal authority, mandates financial services companies to have policies and procedures with respect to measures designed to address any or all of the following matters: (i) customer identification programs; (ii) money laundering; (iii) terrorist financing; (iv) identifying and reporting suspicious 
activities and currency transactions; (v) currency crimes; and (vi) cooperation between FDIC-insured institutions and law enforcement authorities. 
Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate. Concentration risk exists when FDIC-insured institutions deploy too many assets to any one industry or segment. A concentration in commercial real estate is one example of regulatory concern. The interagency Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices guidance (“CRE Guidance”) provides supervisory criteria, including the following numerical indicators, to assist bank examiners in identifying banks with potentially significant commercial real estate loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny: (i) commercial real estate loans exceeding 300% of capital and increasing 50% or more in the preceding three years; or (ii) construction and land development loans exceeding 100% of capital. The CRE Guidance does not limit banks’ levels of commercial real estate lending activities, but rather guides institutions in developing risk management practices and levels of capital that are commensurate with the level and nature of their commercial real estate concentrations. On December 18, 2015, the federal banking agencies issued a statement to reinforce prudent risk-management practices related to CRE lending, having observed substantial growth in many CRE asset and lending markets, increased competitive pressures, rising CRE concentrations in banks, and an easing of CRE underwriting standards. The federal bank agencies reminded FDIC-insured institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise prudent risk-management practices to identify, measure, monitor, and manage the risks arising from CRE lending. In addition, FDIC-insured institutions must maintain capital commensurate with the level and nature of their CRE concentration risk. 
As of December 31, 2020, the Bank did not exceed these guidelines.
Consumer Financial Services. The historical structure of federal consumer protection regulation applicable to all providers of consumer financial products and services changed significantly on July 21, 2011, when the CFPB commenced operations to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all providers of consumer products and services, including the Bank, as well as the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over providers with more than $10 billion in assets. FDIC-insured institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, like the Bank, continue to be examined by their applicable bank regulators. 
Because abuses in connection with residential mortgages were a significant factor contributing to the financial crisis, many new rules issued by the CFPB and required by the Dodd-Frank Act addressed mortgage and mortgage-related products, their underwriting, origination, servicing and sales. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly expanded underwriting requirements applicable to loans secured by 1-4 family residential real property and augmented federal law combating predatory lending practices. In addition to numerous disclosure requirements, the Dodd‑Frank Act imposed new standards for mortgage loan originations on all lenders, including banks and savings associations, in an effort to strongly encourage lenders to verify a borrower’s ability to repay, while also establishing a presumption of compliance for certain “qualified mortgages.” The CFPB has from time to time released additional rules as to qualified mortgages and the borrower’s ability to repay, most recently in October of 2020. 
The CFPB’s rules have not had a significant impact on the Bank’s operations, except for higher compliance costs.
