Government Regulation
 
We have historically positioned the company as a knowledge provider and educator that seeks to augment a user’s informed decision-making process, rather than to act as a conductor of investment decisions or a representative of investment services. As such, most of our activities do not fall within the scope of securities industry regulation. Most of our products and services also do not require that any representative distributing our services conduct themselves as an investment advisor or broker. However, our subsidiary S.A.F.E. Management, LLC, recently received its registration and disclosure approval from the National Futures Association. S.A.F.E. Management, LLC is now a New Jersey State Registered Investment Adviser (“RIA”), Commodities Trading Advisor (“CTA”), and Commodity Pool Operator registered with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and is approved by the CFTC for over-the-counter FOREX advisory services. As a New Jersey-registered RIA, we are required to comply with the laws and regulations of those states in which we have the requisite number of customers governing the activities of investment advisers and the fees they can charge, as well as certain provisions of the Investment Adviser Act of 1940. As a CFTC registered CTA, Commodity Pool Operator, and FOREX adviser, we are required to comply with federal law and CFTC rules regulating those activities.
 
We have established these registrations and the advisory structure to offer automated trade execution, which is managed by S.A.F.E. Management, LLC, in its capacity as an RIA, for equities and equity options and in its capacity as a CTA for commodities, futures, and OTC Forex. In addition, SAFE provides traditional advisory services for clients who do not wish to trade for themselves. Automation of trades is only available through S.A.F.E. Management. No additional approvals are required for any of our current business activities. The cost of maintaining this additional regulated entity could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
We are subject to government regulation in connection with securities laws and regulations applicable to all publicly owned companies as well as laws and regulations applicable to businesses generally. We are also increasingly subject to governmental regulation and legislation specifically targeting Internet companies, such as privacy regulations adopted at the local, state, national and international levels and taxes levied at the state level. Due to the increasing use of the internet, enforcement of existing laws, such as consumer protection regulations, in connection with web-based activities has become more aggressive, and it is expected that new laws and regulations will continue to be enacted at the local, state, national, and international levels. Such existing and new legislation, alone or combined with increasingly aggressive enforcement of existing laws, could have a material adverse effect on our future operating performance and business.
