Item 1. Business.
Description of Business
Tupperware Brands Corporation (“Tupperware” or the “Company”) is a leading global consumer products company that designs innovative, functional, and environmentally responsible products. Founded in 1946, the Company's signature container created the modern food storage category that revolutionized the way the world stores, serves, and prepares food. Today, this iconic brand has more than 8,500 functional design and utility patents for solution-oriented kitchen and home products. With a purpose to nurture a better future, the Company's products are an alternative to single-use items. The Company distributes its products into nearly 80 countries primarily through approximately 3.2 million independent sales force members around the world. Worldwide, the Company engages in the marketing, manufacture, and sale of design-centric preparation, storage, and serving solutions for the kitchen and home through the Tupperware brand name and beauty products through the Avroy Shlain, Fuller, NaturCare, Nutrimetics and Nuvo brands. Each brand manufactures and/or markets a broad line of high-quality products. The Company primarily uses a direct selling business model to distribute and market products, while continuing to expand digital platforms and business-to-business distribution channels. Through personal connections, product demonstrations, and understanding of consumer needs, the Company's sales force members have been selling products to customers for over 75 years.
The Company is a Delaware corporation that was organized on February 8, 1996 in connection with the corporate reorganization of Premark International, Inc. (“Premark”).
New Leadership
In 2020, the Company welcomed a new President & Chief Executive Officer and Director in Miguel Fernandez, who quickly assembled a highly-skilled executive leadership team that he believed had proven track records in direct selling, e-commerce or retail, and who would be able to modernize, and optimize the Company's digital functions through developing an omnichannel, data driven approach in order to drive growth and enhance revenue. Additionally, this team led the reorganization of the Company's structure, simplifying the organization by dividing the Company between commercial activities, departments and individuals that drive sales and top-line growth, and operational activities, essential functions that enable sales and top-line growth. With this new structure, the Company believes it is better aligned to its priorities and that management has a direct line of sight into accountability in the nearly 80 markets around the world in which the Company distributes its products.
This team’s top priority was to develop and begin to execute a Turnaround Plan(a). The key elements of the Turnaround Plan include: increasing the Company's rightsizing plans to improve profitability, accelerating the divestiture of non-core assets to strengthen the balance sheet, restructuring the Company’s debt to enhance liquidity, and structurally fixing the Company’s core business to create a more sustainable business model. The management team made significant progress on these key elements of the Turnaround Plan all while dealing with the new reality of a world affected by COVID-19.

COVID-19
Since early 2020, the Company has followed guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) on actions required by individuals and businesses following the declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic. Over the course of 2020, the pandemic impacted worldwide economic activity and many governments implemented policies intended to stop or slow the further spread of the disease. These policies, such as shelter-in-place orders, remained in place for a significant period of time, resulting in the temporary closure of schools and non-essential businesses. The Company responded by taking actions to keep employees protected, support the Company’s global sales force and communities, and maintain business continuity. Actions taken included:
•Continued monitoring of local and state governments and public health institution recommendations in the markets where the Company operates.
•Revision in real-time of corporate policies and procedures to keep the Company's employees safe around the world.
•Enacting travel bans consistent with emerging needs and regulation.
•Provisioning all required personal protective equipment in manufacturing locations that continued to operate during the pandemic.
•Conducting regular temperature checks for employees and providing additional medical leave and medical assistance as needed.
•Enacting special cleaning and immediate response procedures for office and plant employees.
•Accelerating access to, and training and implementation of, digital platforms for sales force to enable customers to continue to acquire products while enhancing the customer's digital experience.
•Activating a global business continuity committee with representatives from key business functions from all over the world, with a task to guide our global organization through the pandemic with a dual focus on business continuity and health and safety.
•Enabling work from home arrangements and support for associates with virtual tools and equipment as required.
A top priority for the Company as it continues to navigate the impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic is the safety of its employees and their families, sales force and consumers, and to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on its operations and financial results. The Company will continue to proactively respond to the situation and may take further actions that alter the Company’s business operations as may be required by governmental authorities, or that the Company determines are in the best interests of its employees, sales force and consumers. In order to ensure continued safety and protect the health of the employees, and to comply with applicable government directives, the Company has modified its business practices to allow its employees to work remotely, incorporate virtual meetings and restrict all non-essential employee travel until further notice.
Liquidity and Capital Allocation 
During the first quarter of 2020, the Company completed an Amendment(a) related to its $650.0 million Credit Agreement(a) providing debt covenant relief through increasing the leverage ratio(a) allowing the needed flexibility to execute the Turnaround Plan and respond to COVID-19. During the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2020 the Company retired its Senior Notes(a) in the aggregate principal amount of $600.0 million through tender offers, open-market purchases, and redemption by using cash on hand and the proceeds from the Term Loan received in December 2020(a) that it successfully obtained during the fourth quarter of 2020. These measures successfully reduced total debt and improved the overall liquidity of the Company, and as a result of these actions, the earliest maturity of the Company's long-term debt is now in 2023. The Company, has also improved its overall liquidity by focusing on its core business while considering strategic alternatives for non-core assets, including potential divestitures of its beauty and personal care products businesses. During 2020, the beauty businesses in total generated $233.9 million in net sales and $15.4 million in operating income. In the first quarter of 2021, the Company completed the sales of its Avroy Shlain beauty business in South Africa for $33.6 million. In 2021, the Company will continue its efforts to divest non-core assets, specifically concentrating on its remaining beauty businesses. The Company also accelerated its land and property divestitures in 2020 and realized a gain of $13.2 million from the sale of a manufacturing and distribution facility in Australia and $31.6 million from the sale-leaseback of the Company headquarters in Orlando, Florida along with sale of certain surrounding land. The Company completed the sale of the manufacturing facility in France for approximately $9.1 million in the first quarter of 2021. The Company will endeavor to continue to divest land and property in 2021 that is deemed non-core to its ongoing operations.

I. Sales
Products
The Company primarily designs innovative, functional, and environmentally responsible products to help store, serve, and prepare food. The core of the Tupperware brand product line consists of design-centric preparation, storage, and serving solutions for the kitchen and home, in addition to lines of cookware, knives, microwave products, microfiber textiles, water-filtration related items and an array of products for on-the-go consumers. The Company continues to focus on introducing new, more sustainable materials to its product lines; new products designed to solve consumer needs identified by data and insights; and a refined product strategy tied to the Company’s renewed purpose to helping consumers reduce food waste and eliminate the use of single-use plastic materials.
In 2020, new product introductions included:
•The Coffee Station launched in Brazil as the trend of at-home coffee making grew in the wake of the global pandemic; the product is designed to keep coffee grounds or beans, filters, and a scoop all in one place and to help keep contents fresh.
•Ultimate Mixing Bowls and splash guard were launched in Brazil, Europe, Middle East and Africa with plans to introduce the products to priority markets in 2021 including Mexico and the United States.
•Universal Cookware was introduced first in Malaysia as a solution for smaller kitchens with three pieces of cookware that nest and take up the space of a single one. The Universal Cookware will be introduced in other markets in 2021.
•The Handy Spiralizer, designed to twirl out noodles by hand, was introduced in Africa, Europe and Middle East in addition to Brazil, Mexico, United States and Canada in 2020 as an affordable option to help consumers make at-home meals. 
•The High Speed Blender was launched in China. The product features a highly efficient motor for blending, assisting consumers in the preparation of a wide variety of recipes from nut milk to thick soup to porridge.
•A new and innovative ‘air transfer’ decoration technology was introduced in China. 
•Around the world, the Company continued to introduce Eco+ material, the umbrella for the Company’s more sustainable materials including circular materials and bio-based materials; products made with Eco+ material include reusable straws and coffee-to-go cups to aid in the reduction of single-use waste.
In addition to new products, the Company received a United States patent for Passive Orbital Nutrient Delivery System (PONDS), a device the Company, in partnership with Techshot, Inc., helped to create, to aid NASA in growing vegetables in outer space with minimal maintenance for future space exploration. The project also helps the Company better understand the conditions plants need to grow in various environments.
II. Markets
The Company operates its business under four reportable segments in four broad geographic regions: (1) Asia Pacific, (2) Europe (Europe, Africa and the Middle East), (3) North America and (4) South America. See Note 22: Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Report for further details regarding segments information.
Sales are to the ultimate customer principally through a combination of direct selling and marketing by approximately 3.2 million independent sales force members with approximately 534 thousand active at any designated point in time. Products are primarily sold directly to independent distributors, directors, managers and dealers (the “sales force”) throughout the world. Sales force members purchase products at a discount from the Company and then sell them to their customers. Sales methods can differ based on the market.
A significant portion of the Company's business is operated through distributors, some of whom stock inventory and fulfill orders from the sales force that are generally placed after orders have been received from their customers. In a stocking model, the distributor orders product, stocks it in a warehouse and picks, packs and ships it to the sales force for distribution to the end consumer. In a non-stocking model, the distributor’s focus is on increasing the sales force size while the Company manages the stocking and distribution of inventory. Discounts to the distributor are adjusted depending on the level of service provided. Where distributorships are granted, they have the right to market the Company's products and to utilize Tupperware's trademarks, subject to certain limitations. The vast majority of the sales force members are independent contractors and not employees of the Company. 
Some business units utilize a campaign merchandising system, whereby sales force members sell through brochures generated every two or three weeks, to their circle of influence including; friends, neighbors and relatives. The brochures highlight new products and specially-priced items for each sales campaign and allow the sales force to connect one-on-one with the consumer. Generally, the sales force forwards an order to a designated Tupperware distribution center where the product is packaged and shipped to the sales force for delivery to the consumer. 
The Company also uses retail stores and studios, owned by independent sales force members, in certain markets, most predominantly in China. These physical locations provide an entrepreneurial opportunity for independent owners to connect with consumers to demonstrate and sell products while also creating visibility and reinforcing Tupperware’s image with consumers. As of December 26, 2020, our products in China could be purchased at over 5,683 locations with approximately 153 additional stores or studios located in other parts of the world. As part of the Company's Turnaround Plan, the new growth strategy will expand to offer additional in-person product purchasing opportunities to complement the current retail store and studio strategy.
Accelerated by the global pandemic, the Company has seen a worldwide shift by its sales force to incorporate digital methods of doing business. The adoption of digital demonstrations has grown as a result of more people staying at home, thus enabling a sales force member’s ability to reach new customers. Geographic location is no longer a limiting factor for the Company's independent sales force members and the Company sees this adoption of digital tools and methods to selling as a key element of building a more sustainable and predictable business. In 2020, Tupperware provided its sales force with various digital tools to connect with consumers directly through social media and personalized web pages, offered digital training and virtual meetings for sales force development, and maintained direct websites in several countries including but not limited to Brazil, Mexico, and the United States and Canada for consumers to purchase products. As of December 26, 2020, the Company's distribution system had approximately 2 thousand distributors, 106 thousand managers (including directors and team leaders) and 3.2 million independent sales force members worldwide. 
Business Strategy
As its business strategy evolves, as part of the Turnaround Plan, the Company is focused on accelerating modernization in two areas. First is improving the core direct sales business, introducing a data-driven approach to sales force marketing, communication and recruitment, and introducing new digital tools and training to make doing business more efficient. The Company is working on an approach to personalize the customer experience based on consumer behaviors. The Company has defined two distinct groups within its sales force – those who want to build a business or career with the Company (the “Business Builders”), and those who want access to discounted or exclusive products (the “Preferred Buyers”). Future communications, service, support and marketing approach will be tailored with these segmented audiences in mind.
Second, the Company is focused on business expansion opportunities, by shifting from a business model reliant solely on the direct sales channel to drive consumer demand, to a business model that creates a natural "pull and push" to the brand to lift up all channels in which Company products are available. This includes expanding into more product categories where the Tupperware brand is in demand and creating more access points for consumers to purchase Company products – both in person and online. 
Company efforts are underway in creating a consumer-tailored product and pricing strategy intended to reach and address the needs of all consumer socioeconomic levels, while also exploring alternative revenue streams for incremental business-to-business opportunities and new licensing opportunities to leverage the value of its iconic brand. This strategy is designed to create additional brand awareness and create new leads for the Company’s independent sales force and increase revenue from channels and consumers that the Tupperware brand does not reach today.
III. Competition
The Company has many competitors both domestically and internationally. The principal bases of competition generally are marketing, price, quality and innovation of products, as well as competition with other companies for independent sales force. Due to the nature of the direct selling industry, it is critical that the Company provides a compelling earnings opportunity for the sales force, along with developing new and innovative products. The Company maintains its competitive position, in part, through a focus on product design, quality, and innovation, as well as the use of strong incentives and promotional programs.
Through its Tupperware brand, the Company competes in the food storage, serving and preparation, containers, children's toys and gifts categories. Through its beauty and personal care brands, the Company also competes in the skin care, cosmetics, toiletries, fragrances and nutritionals categories. The Company works to differentiate itself from its competitors through its brand names, product innovation, quality, value-added services, celebrity endorsements, technological sophistication, new product introductions and its channel of distribution, including the training, motivation and compensation arrangements for its independent sales force.
IV. Resources
Many of the products manufactured by and for the Company require specialty polymers including plastic resins that meet its rigorous design and quality specifications. These resins are purchased through various arrangements with a number of large chemical companies located in many of the markets in which the Company has a presence or sells its products. Research and development relating to these polymers and resins used in Tupperware brand name products is performed by both the Company and its suppliers. In 2020, the Company experienced shipping constraints and delays coming from sourced suppliers due to COVID-19.
Materials used in the Company's skin care, nutritionals, cosmetic and bath and body care products consist primarily of readily available ingredients, containers and packaging materials. Such raw materials and components used in goods manufactured and assembled by the Company and through outsource arrangements are available from a number of sources. To date, the Company has been able to secure an adequate supply of raw materials for its products, and it endeavors to maintain relationships with backup suppliers in an effort to ensure that no interruptions occur in its operations.
The Company considers its trademarks and patents to be of material importance to its business. Except for the Tupperware trademark, which the Company considers to be among its most valuable assets, the Company is not dependent upon any single patent or trademark, or group of patents or trademarks. The Tupperware trademark, as well as its other trademarks, is registered on a country-by-country basis. The current duration for such registration ranges from five years to ten years; however, each such registration may be renewed an unlimited number of times. The patents used in the Company's business are registered and maintained on a country-by-country basis, with a variety of durations. The Company has followed the practice of applying for design and utility patents with respect to most of its significant patentable developments.
V. Government Regulations
Compliance with government regulations, including those relating to environmental protection, has not had in the past, and is not expected to have in the future, a material effect upon the Company's capital expenditures, liquidity, earnings or competitive position.
VI. Human Capital
As of December 26, 2020, the Company had approximately 10,698 employees, of whom approximately 465 are based in the United States. With the new leadership team and Turnaround Plan introduced by the Company in 2020, the Company reinforced its corporate guiding principles. With a new core values statement defined as "doing what’s right, always improving and succeeding together", the Company updated its vision and strategy for people management to ensure alignment. The Company introduced five core areas related to human capital in order to create a performance-driven culture with employee pride:
•Design and build an effective organization that achieves results.
•Introduce management by objectives and service level agreements to reinforce performance and accountability.
•Establish new practices for selecting, assessing, and developing the right talent to build a high performance team.
•Set the basis for a value based culture of full accountability and excellence.
•Create incentive programs aligned to Company strategy and motivate through rewards and recognition.
As a result of defining the above areas, in 2020, the Company introduced the following initiatives:
•Global communications forums such as monthly town hall meetings and an internal communications hub for the Company’s global associates to access more about the organizational structure, business updates tied to corporate strategy, new Company initiatives and products and more.
•TuppFlex, a corporate philosophy of adopting new work policies to include more flexible work hours, increasing the number of employees who can work remotely and reducing office space as more people will telework more days per week as a result of COVID-19.
•TuppSTAR, a global recognition and rewards program to align with the Company’s principles, values and core competencies that ensures accountability and inclusivity and supports Company culture and employee engagement.
•TuppTalent, a new talent process to assess bench-strength and talent pipeline in order to build and integrate new employees within the Company, including the launch of the first early talent identification program class to identify top talent around the world and give students an opportunity to support high-profile projects to support the Company’s business strategy.
•New organizational structure by dividing the Company between commercial activities, departments and individuals that drive sales and top-line growth, and operational activities, essential functions that enable sales and top-line growth, to strengthen the Company to deliver long-term value.
•Improved processes and ways of working through performance management and goal alignment and adoption of more data analytics in core human resources processes and activities.
VII. Environmental, Social and Governance
In 2020, the Company redefined its purpose to more closely align with its over 75 year commitment to being ‘environmentally friendly’, which reflect the concerns, desires, and needs of consumers for more reusable, durable and environmentally-friendly products. With this purpose to nurture a better future every day, the Company expects to make decisions that benefit people, the planet, and communities served by the Company and its sales force.
Recently, the Company was named to Newsweek’s list of America’s Most Responsible Companies 2021, an honor the Company believes is a reflection of its enhanced commitment to environmental, social, and governance initiatives. Key activities in 2020, as well as over the course of the Company's history, to build a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly organization include:
•Publishing the Company’s ninth sustainability report reflecting the priority sustainability impacts of the business on stakeholders that were defined in a materiality assessment conducted in 2017. The report was prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards and for the first time, the Company reported against the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standard for the containers and packaging industry in the resource transformation sector.
•Entering into a partnership with TerraCycle’s reuse platform Loop to advance the mission to shift consumer behavior from buying consumer goods in disposable packaging to purchasing goods in durable, reusable packaging. Products available on the Loop platform are packaged and shipped directly to consumers in a specially designed tote. Once used, products are retrieved through free at-home pickup, then cleaned, refilled and reused. The Company believes its products will help alleviate consumer packaging challenges with plans to pilot this program first in the United States and Canada in 2021.
•Signing a sponsorship agreement with the National Park Foundation (NPF) to support efforts to keep parks green across the National Park System and enhance environmental stewardship with a focus on reusable products and waste reduction.
•For over 75 years, the Company has provided alternatives to single-use plastic products, has offered career paths and opportunities to women, and has been committed to gender and racial diversity.
In 2021, the Company plans to conduct a new materiality assessment for environmental, social, and governance initiatives that will reflect developments in the Company’s business strategy and new stakeholder expectations in the wake of the impacts of COVID-19.
VIII. Other
On a quarterly basis, sales are impacted by holiday schedules, vacations by sales force members, as well as promotional activities during these periods, which vary by market. The Company's business is not dependent on a small number of customers, nor is any of its business subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the United States government.
