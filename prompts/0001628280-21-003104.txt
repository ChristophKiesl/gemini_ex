ITEM 1. Business.
Corporate Overview and Strategy
Chesapeake Utilities Corporation is a Delaware corporation formed in 1947 with operations primarily in the Mid-Atlantic region, Florida and Ohio. We are an energy delivery company engaged in the distribution of natural gas, electricity and propane; the transmission of natural gas; the generation of electricity and steam, and in providing related services to our customers. Our strategy is focused on growing earnings from a stable utility foundation and investing in related businesses and services that provide opportunities for returns greater than traditional utility returns. We are focused on identifying and developing opportunities across the energy value chain, with emphasis on midstream and downstream investments that are accretive to earnings per share, consistent with our long-term growth strategy and create opportunities to continue our record of top tier returns on equity relative to our peer group. The Company’s growth strategy includes the continued investment and expansion of the Company’s natural gas operations that provide a stable base of earnings, as well as investments in other related (non-regulated businesses) and services. By investing in these related business and services, the Company creates opportunities to sustain its track record of higher returns, as compared to a traditional utility.

Currently, the Company’s growth strategy is focused on the following platforms, including:•Optimizing the earnings growth in our existing businesses, which includes organic growth, territory expansions, and new products and services as well as increased opportunities for collaboration and efficiencies across the organization.•Identification and pursuit of additional pipeline expansions, including new interstate and intrastate transmission projects.•Growth of Marlin Gas Services’ CNG transport business and expansion into LNG and RNG transport services as well as methane capture.•Identifying and undertaking additional strategic propane acquisitions that provide a larger foundation in current markets and expand our brand and presence into new strategic growth markets.•Pursuit of growth opportunities that enable us to utilize our integrated set of energy delivery businesses to participate in renewable energy opportunities.

Operating Segments
We operate within two reportable segments: Regulated Energy and Unregulated Energy. The remainder of our operations is presented as “Other businesses and eliminations." These segments are described below in detail.    
Regulated Energy
Our regulated energy businesses are comprised of natural gas and electric distribution, as well as natural gas transmission services. The following table presents net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 and total assets as of December 31, 2020, for our Regulated Energy segment by operation and area served:

Operations | Areas Served | Net Income | | Total Assets

 (1) Delmarva Natural Gas consists of Delaware division, Maryland division, Sandpiper Energy and Elkton Gas.
Revenues in the Regulated Energy segment are based on rates regulated by the PSC in the states in which we operate or, in the case of Eastern Shore, which is an interstate business, by the FERC. The rates are designed to generate revenues to recover all prudent operating and financing costs and provide a reasonable return for our stockholders. Each of our distribution and transmission operations has a rate base, which generally consists of the original cost of the operation's plant, less accumulated depreciation, working capital and other assets. For Delmarva Natural Gas and Eastern Shore, rate base also includes deferred income tax liabilities and other additions or deductions. Our Regulated Energy operations in Florida do not include deferred income tax liabilities in their rate base.
Our natural gas and electric distribution operations bill customers at standard rates approved by their respective state PSC. Each state PSC allows us to negotiate rates, based on approved methodologies, for large customers that can switch to other fuels. Some of our customers in Maryland receive propane through underground distribution systems in Worcester County. We bill these customers under PSC-approved rates and include them in the natural gas distribution results and customer statistics. 
Our natural gas and electric distribution operations earn profits on the delivery of natural gas or electricity to customers. The cost of natural gas or electricity that we deliver is passed through to customers under PSC-approved fuel cost recovery mechanisms. The mechanisms allow us to adjust our rates on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case to recover changes in the cost of the natural gas and electricity that we purchase for customers. Therefore, while our distribution operating revenues fluctuate with the cost of natural gas or electricity we purchase, our distribution margin (which we define as operating revenues less purchased gas or electric cost) is generally not impacted by fluctuations in the cost of natural gas or electricity. 
Our natural gas transmission operations bill customers under rate schedules approved by the FERC or at rates negotiated with customers. 
Acquisition of Elkton Gas
In July 2020, we closed on the acquisition of Elkton Gas, which provides natural gas distribution service to approximately 7,000 residential and commercial customers within a franchised area of Cecil County, Maryland. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data (Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures in the consolidated financial statements) for further information. The results of Elkton Gas are now included within our Delmarva Natural Gas distribution operations.

(1) Eastern Shore's and Peninsula Pipeline's service to our local distribution affiliates is based on the respective regulator's approved rates and is an integral component of the cost associated with providing natural gas supplies to the end users of those affiliates. We eliminate operating revenues of these entities against the cost of sales of those affiliates in our consolidated financial information; however, our local distribution affiliates include this amount in their purchased fuel cost and recover it through fuel cost recovery mechanisms.
(2) Operating revenues from "Other" sources are from the rental of gas properties.
Regulatory Overview
The following table highlights key regulatory information for each of our principal Regulated Energy operations. Peninsula Pipeline is not regulated with regard to cost of service by either the Florida PSC or FERC and is therefore excluded from the table. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data (Note 19, Rates and Other Regulatory Activities, in the consolidated financial statements) for further discussion on the impact of this legislation on our regulated businesses.

In October 2018, Hurricane Michael passed through FPU's electric distribution operation's service territory in Northwest Florida and caused widespread and severe damage to FPU's infrastructure resulting in the loss of electric service to 100 percent of its customers in the Northwest Florida service territory. FPU expended more than $65.0 million to restore service, which was recorded as new plant and equipment, charged against FPU’s accumulated depreciation or charged against FPU’s storm reserve. 
In August 2019, FPU filed a limited proceeding requesting recovery of storm-related costs associated with Hurricane Michael (capital and expenses) through a change in base rates. FPU also requested treatment and recovery of certain storm-related costs as regulatory assets for items currently not allowed to be recovered through the storm reserve as well as the recovery of capital replaced as a result of the storm. Recovery of these costs included a component of an overall return on capital additions and regulatory assets. In March 2020, we filed an update to our original filing to account for actual charges incurred through December 2019, revised the amortization period of the storm-related costs from 30 years as originally requested to 10 years, and included costs related to Hurricane Dorian of approximately $1.2 million in this filing. 
In late 2019, the Florida PSC approved an interim rate increase, subject to refund, effective January 1, 2020, associated with the restoration effort following Hurricane Michael. We fully reserved these interim rates, pending a final resolution and settlement of the limited proceeding. In September 2020, the Florida PSC approved a settlement agreement between FPU and the Office of the Public Counsel regarding final cost recovery and rates associated with Hurricane Michael. The settlement agreement allowed us to: (a) refund the over-collection of interim rates through the fuel clause; (b) record regulatory assets for storm costs in the amount of $45.8 million including interest which will be amortized over six years; (c) recover these storm costs through a surcharge totaling $7.7 million annually; and (d) collect an annual increase in revenue of $3.3 million to recover capital costs associated with new plant investments and a regulatory asset for the cost of removal and undepreciated plant. The new base rates and storm surcharge were effective on November 1, 2020. 
In September 2019, FPU filed a petition, with the Florida PSC, for approval of its consolidated electric depreciation rates. The petition was joined to the Hurricane Michael docket, and was approved at the Florida PSC Agenda in September 2020. The approved rates were retroactively applied effective January 1, 2020. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data (Note 19, Rates and Other Regulatory Activities, in the consolidated financial statements) for further information. 
The following table presents surcharge and other mechanisms that have been approved by the respective PSC for our regulated energy distribution businesses. These include Delaware surcharges to expand natural gas service in its service territory as well as for the conversion of propane distribution systems to natural gas, Maryland’s surcharges to fund natural gas conversions and system improvements in Worcester County, Florida’s GRIP surcharge which provides accelerated recovery of the costs of replacing older portions of the natural gas distribution system to improve safety and reliability and the Florida electric distribution operation's limited proceeding which allowed recovery of storm-related costs.

Weather
Weather variations directly influence the volume of natural gas and electricity sold and delivered to residential and commercial customers for heating and cooling and changes in volumes delivered impact the revenue generated from these customers. Natural gas volumes are highest during the winter months, when residential and commercial customers use more natural gas for heating. Demand for electricity is highest during the summer months, when more electricity is used for cooling. We measure the relative impact of weather using degree-days. A degree-day is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature falls above or below 65 degrees Fahrenheit. Each degree of temperature below 65 degrees Fahrenheit is counted as one heating degree-day, and each degree of temperature above 65 degrees Fahrenheit is counted as one cooling degree-day. Normal heating and cooling degree-days are based on the most recent 10-year average.
Competition
Natural Gas Distribution
While our natural gas distribution operations do not compete directly with other distributors of natural gas for residential and commercial customers in our service areas, we do compete with other natural gas suppliers and alternative fuel providers for sales to industrial customers. Large customers could bypass our natural gas distribution systems and connect directly to interstate or interstate transmission pipelines, and we compete in all aspects of our natural gas business with alternative energy sources, including electricity, oil, propane and renewables. The most effective means to compete against alternative fuels are lower prices, superior reliability and flexibility of service. Natural gas historically has maintained a price advantage in the residential, commercial and industrial markets, and reliability of natural gas supply and service has been excellent. In addition, we provide flexible pricing to our large customers to minimize fuel switching and protect these volumes and their contributions to the profitability of our natural gas distribution operations. 
Natural Gas Transmission
Our natural gas transmission business competes with other interstate and intrastate pipeline companies to provide service to large industrial, generation and distribution customers, primarily in the northern portion of the Delmarva Peninsula and in Florida.
Electric Distribution
While our electric distribution operations do not compete directly with other distributors of electricity for residential and commercial customers in our service areas, we do compete with other electricity suppliers and alternative fuel providers for sales to industrial customers. Some of our large industrial customers may be capable of generating their own electricity, and we structure rates, service offerings and flexibility to retain these customers in order to retain their business and contributions to the profitability of our electric distribution operations. 
Supplies, Transmission and Storage
Natural Gas Distribution
Our natural gas distribution operations purchase natural gas from marketers and producers and maintain contracts for transportation and storage with several interstate pipeline companies to meet projected customer demand requirements. We believe that our supply and capacity strategy will adequately meet our customers’ needs over the next several years and we will continue to adapt our supply strategy to meet projected growth in customer demand within our service territories. 
The Delmarva natural gas distribution systems are directly connected to Eastern Shore’s pipeline, which has connections to other pipelines that provide us with transportation and storage. These operations can also use propane-air and liquefied natural gas peak-shaving equipment to serve customers. In March 2020, our Delmarva Peninsula natural gas distribution operations entered into asset management agreements with a third party to manage their natural gas transportation and storage capacity. The agreements were effective as of April 1, 2020 and expire on March 31, 2023. Previously, our Delmarva Peninsula natural gas distribution operation had asset management agreements with PESCO to manage their natural gas transportation and storage capacity. Our Delmarva operations receive a fee, which we share with our customers, from the asset manager, who optimizes the transportation, storage and natural gas supply for these operations.
Our Florida natural gas distribution operation uses Peninsula Pipeline and Peoples Gas to transport natural gas where there is no direct connection with FGT. In May 2019, FPU natural gas distribution and Eight Flags entered into separate asset management agreements with Emera Energy Services, Inc. to manage their natural gas transportation capacity. Short-term agreements were entered for a term beginning July 2019 through October 2020 with long-term agreements executed for a 10-year term commencing on November 2020. An agreement with Florida Southeast Connection LLC commenced in June 2020 for additional service to Palm Beach County for an initial term through December 2044.

Propane Operations 
Our propane operations sell propane to residential, commercial/industrial, wholesale and AutoGas customers, in the Mid-Atlantic region and Florida, through Sharp Energy, Inc., Sharpgas, Inc., FPU and Flo-gas. We deliver to and bill our propane customers based on two primary customer types: bulk delivery customers and metered customers. Bulk delivery customers receive deliveries into tanks at their location. We invoice and record revenues for these customers at the time of delivery. Metered customers are either part of an underground propane distribution system or have a meter installed on the tank at their location. We invoice and recognize revenue for these customers based on their consumption as dictated by scheduled meter reads. As a member of AutoGas Alliance, we install and support propane vehicle conversion systems for vehicle fleets and provide on-site fueling infrastructure. 
Propane Operations - Operational Highlights
For the year ended December 31, 2020, operating revenues, volumes sold and average number of customers by customer class for our propane operations were as follows:

Competition
Our propane operations compete with national and local independent companies primarily on the basis of price and service. Propane is generally a cheaper fuel for home heating than oil and electricity but more expensive than natural gas. Our propane operations are largely concentrated in areas that are not currently served by natural gas distribution systems.
Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2020 Form 10-K Page 8


Table of Contents

Supplies, Transportation and Storage
We purchase propane from major oil companies and independent natural gas liquids producers. Propane is transported by truck and rail to our bulk storage facilities in Delaware, Maryland, Florida, Pennsylvania and Virginia, which have a total storage capacity of 8.3 million gallons. Deliveries are made from these facilities by truck to tanks located on customers’ premises or to central storage tanks that feed our underground propane distribution systems. While propane supply has traditionally been adequate, significant fluctuations in weather, closing of refineries and disruption in supply chains, could cause temporary reductions in available supplies.
Weather
Propane revenues are affected by seasonal variations in temperature and weather conditions, which directly influence the volume of propane used by our customers. Our propane revenues are typically highest during the winter months when propane is used for heating. Sustained warmer-than-normal temperatures will tend to reduce propane use, while sustained colder-than-normal temperatures will tend to increase consumption.
Unregulated Energy Transmission and Supply (Aspire Energy)
Aspire Energy owns approximately 2,700 miles of natural gas pipeline systems in 40 counties in Ohio. The majority of Aspire Energy’s revenues are derived from long-term supply agreements with Columbia Gas of Ohio and Consumers Gas Cooperative ("CGC"), which together serve more than 21,400 end-use customers. Aspire Energy purchases natural gas to serve these customers from conventional producers in the Marcellus and Utica natural gas production areas. In addition, Aspire Energy earns revenue by gathering and processing natural gas for customers. 
For the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020, Aspire Energy's operating revenues and deliveries by customer type were as follows:

 | Operating revenues | | Deliveries

Divestiture of PESCO
Beginning in the third quarter of 2019, our management began executing a strategy to sell the operating assets of PESCO. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we closed on four separate transactions to sell PESCO's assets and contracts. As a result of these sales, we have fully exited the natural gas marketing business, which provided natural gas management and supply services to commercial and industrial customers in Florida, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Ohio and other states. Accordingly, PESCO’s historical financial results are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations, which required retrospective application to financial information for all periods presented. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data (Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures, in the consolidated financial statements) for further information.

Human Capital Initiatives 
We are a trusted energy delivery company providing essential, safe, reliable, affordable, sustainable and efficient energy solutions to existing and new communities. Our success is the direct result of our employees and our strong culture that fully engages our team and promotes equity, diversity, inclusion, integrity, accountability and reliability. We believe that a combination of diverse team members and an inclusive culture contributes to the success of our Company and to enhanced societal advancement. Each employee is a valued member of our team bringing a diverse perspective to help grow our business and achieve our goals. Our tradition of serving employees, customers, investors, partners and communities is at the core of our culture. Among the ongoing initiatives across our enterprise, we highlight below the importance of our team, as well as our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our culture of safety, and our environmental, social and governance stewardship. 
Our Team Drives Our Performance
Our President and CEO begins and ends every speech to employees by expressing his gratitude for everything they do to ensure safety and enable the Company to generate strong financial performance, year-over-year. Our employees are the key to our success. Our leadership and human resources teams are responsible for attracting and retaining top talent. We seek to promote from within, reviewing strategic positions regularly and identifying potential internal candidates to fill those positions, evaluating critical job skill sets to identify competency gaps and creating developmental plans to facilitate employee professional growth. We provide training and development programs as well as tuition reimbursement to promote continued professional growth.
As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of 947 employees, 110 of whom are union employees represented by two labor unions: the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. The collective bargaining agreements with these labor unions expire in 2022. We consider our relationships with employees, including those covered by collective bargaining agreements, to be in good standing. We provide a competitive Total Rewards package for our employees including health insurance coverage, wellness initiatives, retirement savings benefits, paid time off, employee assistance programs, competitive pay, career growth opportunities, paid volunteer time, and a culture of recognition. In 2020, the Company was recognized as a Top Workplace for the ninth consecutive year. These honors were based entirely on feedback from employees who were surveyed by the research firm ‘Energage’. Because of these accolades, early in 2021, the Company earned national recognition as an inaugural 2021 Top Workplaces USA award recipient among mid-sized companies.
In 2020, the Company enhanced our diversity initiatives and established an Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (“EDI”) Council with newly expanded Employee Resource Groups (“ERG”). This initiative aligns with our current employee recognition and appreciation programs and our Women in Energy ERG where we celebrate the dedication and success of women employees within the energy industry and our Company. We are committed to a workplace that embraces a culture of equity, diversity and inclusion that is open to individuals of different backgrounds, perspectives, genders and gender identities, races and ethnicities, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, and individuals with disabilities. Additionally, in 2020, we hosted monthly “EDI Wise” presentations whose primary purpose is to educate and inform employees about topics around equity, diversity and inclusion. These presentations are recorded and are available to employees across the enterprise for viewing at their convenience.
COVID-19 Response
On March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Subsequently, states enacted stay-at-home orders to slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, and reduce the burden on the U.S.

health care system. In response to COVID-19, we promptly implemented our long-standing emergency response plan in coordination and collaboration with the Board of Directors, senior leadership and our entire team across the organization. Our objectives were simple – do whatever it takes to ensure the health, safety and well-being of our employees, customers and the communities we serve. Our information systems team swiftly established protocols and security to ensure that the members of our team had the technology and accessibility to safely work in a remote environment, given consideration to job requirements. We worked with our operations team to ensure that our employees were designated essential workers, received personal protective equipment and were compensated with premium pay for working on the front lines. 
We created several Pandemic Taskforce teams and our Human Resources Taskforce took the lead on a Return to Work protocol for those employees who were sick. Through these efforts, as well as our continued commitment to monitor, assess and implement guidance and best practices recommended by the CDC, we have been able to maintain the continuity of the essential services that we provide, while also minimizing the spread of the virus and promoting the health, well-being and safety of our employees, customers and communities. While we continued to provide these services, we recognized the impacts of the pandemic on the communities where we live and work. We took immediate steps and (i) donated an additional $200,000, beyond our historical levels of charitable giving, to support response and relief organizations assisting communities affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and (ii) authorized a one-time grant from our SHARING program for customers economically impacted by the spread of the pandemic. To minimize financial hardships, at the onset of COVID-19, the Company’s regulated businesses suspended disconnections and waived late payment fees for all of our customers.
Our response to COVID-19 and financial performance in 2020 was a direct result of the strength and dedication of our team members, our strong culture, our solid corporate governance practices, and the channels through which we engage and collaborate across our family of businesses. We continue to hold regular companywide all employee calls and leadership meetings with our President and CEO to discuss, among other things, matters pertaining to COVID-19, in addition to distributing frequent, routine communications updates. The Company’s Board met regularly and virtually, throughout 2020, and received updates on the Company’s actions related to COVID-19, the Company’s safety protocols, and ongoing monitoring, including updates on the Company’s COVID-19 Human Resources Taskforce’s priorities and current employee health statistics, and the Company’s risk posture. 
Workplace Safety
We believe that there is nothing more important than the safety of our team, our customers and our communities. We are committed to ensuring safety is at the center of our culture and the way we do business. The importance of safety is exhibited throughout the entire organization, with the direction and tone set by both our Board and our President and CEO, and including required attendance at monthly safety meetings and the inclusion of safety moments at key team meetings. 
To meet our safety goals our employees remain committed and work together to ensure that our plans, programs, policies and behaviors are aligned with our aspirations as a Company. The achievement of superior safety performance is both an important short-term and long-term strategic initiative in managing our operations. For example, our new $1.0 million state-of-the-art training center, named ‘Safety Town,’ provides employees hands-on training and simulated on-the-job field experiences, which will help us maintain the integrity of our current infrastructure and future projects. This center will enable us to further our community outreach, through the training of many regional first responders. Training and preparing our current and future employees and contractors is critical to maintaining a skilled workforce and ensuring the long-term safety of our local communities. 
Environmental, Social and Governance Stewardship ("ESG") 
Consistent with our culture of teamwork, the broad responsibility of ESG stewardship is supported across our organization by the dedication and efforts of our Board of Directors and its Committees, as well as the entrepreneurship and dedication of our team. As stewards of long-term enterprise value, the Board of Directors is committed to overseeing the sustainability of the Company and its safety and operational compliance practices, and to promoting equity, diversity and inclusion that reflects the diverse communities we serve. The Corporate Governance Committee oversees our ESG activities and initiatives to continue enhancing our culture of sustainability and corporate governance practices. The Audit Committee oversees the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting process, our risk exposure, and implementation and effectiveness of our risk management programs. The Compensation Committee promotes a culture of equity, diversity and inclusion and contributes to the ability to attract, retain, develop and motivate both at the executive level and throughout the organization. Finally, the Investment Committee assists the Board of Directors with evaluating investments pursuant to or in support of our growth strategy, both organically and through acquisitions, including renewable natural gas and other sustainable initiatives.
