ITEM 1.      BUSINESS
Company Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative cardiovascular medicines. Our lead product candidate etripamil is a novel, potent and short-acting calcium channel blocker that we designed as a rapid-onset nasal spray to be self-administered by patients. We are developing etripamil to treat paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, or PSVT, atrial fibrillation (AF) and rapid ventricular rate, or AFib-RVR, and other cardiovascular indications.
​
PSVT is a rapid heart rate condition characterized by episodes of supraventricular tachycardia, or SVT, that start and stop without warning. Episodes of SVT are often experienced by patients with symptoms including palpitations, sweating, chest pressure or pain, shortness of breath, sudden onset of fatigue, lightheadedness or dizziness, fainting and anxiety. Calcium channel blockers have long been approved for the treatment of PSVT as well as other cardiac conditions. Calcium channel blockers available in oral form are frequently used prophylactically to control the frequency and duration of future episodes of SVT. For treatment of episodes of SVT, approved calcium channel blockers are administered intravenously under medical supervision, usually in the emergency department. The combination of convenient nasal-spray delivery, rapid-onset and short duration of action of etripamil has the potential to shift the current treatment paradigm for episodes of SVT away from the burdensome and costly emergency department setting. If approved, we believe that etripamil will be the first self-administered therapy for the rapid termination of episodes of SVT wherever and whenever they occur.
​
In March 2020, we reported topline results of the first part of the NODE-301 pivotal trial of etripamil for the treatment of PSVT, which is a placebo-controlled Phase 3 safety and efficacy trial. The first part of NODE-301, which enrolled a total of 431 patients across 65 sites in the United States and Canada, did not meet its primary endpoint of time to conversion of SVT to sinus rhythm compared to placebo over the five-hour period after study drug administration. The median time to conversion for etripamil was 25 minutes (95% CI: 16, 43) compared to 50 minutes (95% CI: 31,101) for placebo (p=0.12). Despite early activity, including the conversion of 61% of etripamil patients compared to 45% of placebo patients within 45 minutes after study drug administration (p=0.02), a time period consistent with etripamil’s pharmacological activity, results from the latter part of the analysis confounded the statistical analysis of the primary endpoint. 
​
The study demonstrated statistically significant differences in favor of etripamil treated patient compared to those taking placebo in the secondary endpoint of patient reported treatment satisfaction, as measured by a treatment satisfaction questionnaire for medication (TSQM-9), including global satisfaction (p=0.0069) and effectiveness scores (p=0.0015). Additionally, there was a trend towards improvement in the percentage of patients seeking rescue medical intervention, 

6



including in the emergency department, with 15% and 27% etripamil and placebo patients, respectively, reporting such intervention (p=0.12).
​
The most common AEs observed in patients receiving etripamil were nasal irritation (19.6%) and congestion (6.7%), and these events were typically transient in nature and most commonly characterized by patients as mild in severity. There were no significant differences in incidences of severe adverse events or adverse events of interest, such as atrioventricular nodal blocks or blood pressure-related symptoms, across the etripamil and placebo groups. We believe the safety and tolerability data from the first part of the NODE-301 trial is supportive of at-home use of etripamil, with adverse events, or AEs, largely consistent with those observed in prior trials.
​
We are continuing the second part of the NODE-301 trial, NODE-301B, which we have renamed the RAPID trial. The RAPID trial continues to follow patients already randomized in the NODE-301 trial who did not administer a dose of the study drug before the end of the first part of the trial. We are also expanding the RAPID trial to add more clinical study sites and more patients. We plan to analyze the final data from the RAPID trial separately as a second efficacy data set.
​
In July 2020, we announced that we received guidance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on our proposal to alter the size and design of the RAPID trial as well as the overall program based on the data from the NODE-301 trial. The FDA indicated that two studies, the RAPID study and the completed NODE-301 study, could potentially fulfill the efficacy requirement for our planned NDA for etripamil in patients with PSVT.
​
Under an updated statistical analysis plan, or SAP, the primary efficacy endpoint for both the RAPID and NODE-301 studies will be defined as time to conversion over the first 30 minutes, with a target p- value of less than 0.05 for each study. This endpoint supports the desire of patients to rapidly address their PSVT symptoms during an episode and ideally avoid visiting the emergency department. Later and earlier time points will also be assessed as part of secondary analyses to fully characterize the efficacy profile of etripamil.
​
When employing the updated SAP retrospectively to the NODE-301 data, 54% of etripamil patients vs. 35% of placebo patients converted within 30 minutes (HR 1.87, p=0.02). We believe, based on interactions with PSVT treating physicians and cardiovascular thought leaders, that a 50% conversion rate within 60 minutes is a clinically meaningful outcome given the symptomatic nature of SVT episodes and the lack of approved at-home treatments. Assuming a positive outcome in the RAPID study, these data could potentially serve to fulfill the efficacy requirement for the NDA.
​
The RAPID trial was originally an ongoing trial named NODE-301B and was designed to collect double-blind data from randomized patients who had not yet experienced an SVT event after the NODE-301 study reached its target number of adjudicated SVT events. After receiving guidance from the FDA on our Phase 3 program, we have amended and expanded NODE-301B and renamed it the RAPID trial. The RAPID trial will include the 170 patients who are already enrolled in NODE-301B and is expected to enroll approximately 500 patients in total. The trial will be completed after a total of 180 confirmed SVT events are reached. Additional patients enrolled in the RAPID study will be randomized 1:1. 
​
During the fourth quarter of 2020, we observed delays in our enrollment and clinical trial site startups for the RAPID study. We believe the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact contributed to such delays. As a result we have taken measures to increase the enrollment of patients by increasing the number of clinical trial sites, including more clinical sites planned in European countries to diversify and better protect the study recruitment against COVID’s geographical resurgences.  We are also increasing site specific support for clinical trial sites currently open. We will continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the study and expect to continue these enrollment enhancing initiatives throughout 2021. While we monitor the effect of those initiatives, we are maintaining our guidance of achieving topline data from the RAPID trial in late 2021 or early 2022.
​
Based on discussions with the FDA regarding maximizing the treatment effect of etripamil, the RAPID study will allow for a repeat administration of study drug (either 70 mg of etripamil or placebo) for patients who have not experienced symptom relief within 10 minutes of the first study drug administration. This tailored regimen, using a repeat-dose is similar to current PSVT treatment practices with intravenous drugs in the emergency department setting. It is enabled by 

7



the favorable safety data from the NODE-301 study. We expect that the repeat administration could benefit a broader group of patients, including those with more persistent episodes. In the NODE-301 study, 32% of etripamil patients and 14% of placebo patients converted to sinus rhythm within 10 minutes. The FDA agreed that the single and repeat administrations of etripamil could be pooled and compared to placebo for the primary analysis, resulting in no increase in the sample size.
​
We are in the process of initiating patient access programs that have as their primary objective providing further access to etripamil for future SVT episodes to patients who have participated in the clinical development registration trials. These programs will be tailored to meet the regulatory requirements in the territories in which the clinical sites are located.
​
As with PSVT, calcium channel blockers are also approved for use in intravenous form for the treatment of some episodes of atrial fibrillation, or AF, in which patients experience rapid ventricular rates. Our initial qualitative market research indicates that the target addressable market for etripamil in patients with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular rate is approximately 40% of the five to six million patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. We believe that etripamil has the potential to be developed such that it can be used by patients to rapidly reduce their heart rate in the at-home setting to provide a supplemental option to the oral rate or rhythm control strategy their physician has already prescribed. We began enrollment of patients in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial titled ReVeRA in the first quarter of 2021 to evaluate the potential effectiveness of etripamil to reduce ventricular rate in AFib-RVR episodes. The Phase 2 double blind, placebo controlled, proof-of-concept, which will be conducted in Canada in collaboration with the Montreal Heart Institute and other research centers, is expected to enroll approximately 50 patients randomized 1:1 to receive either 70 mg of etripamil nasal spray or placebo. The primary endpoint will assess reduction in ventricular rate, with key secondary endpoints including the time to achieve the maximum reduction in rate and the duration of the effect. The trial is to be conducted in the hospital or emergency department setting under medical supervision.We anticipate reporting data following disclosure of top line results of the RAPID trial.
​
As we generate more data on the safety and efficacy profile of etripamil in PSVT and assess the proof-of-concept results from the ReVeRA trial, we will continue to assess whether etripamil could be further developed in PSVT and AFib-RVR, and other areas of unmet medical need.

Safety Studies
​
In addition to NODE-301 and the RAPID trial, the clinical development program for etripamil for PSVT consists of two other Phase 3 clinical trials, as well as completed Phase 2 and Phase 1 trials. NODE-302 is our ongoing Phase 3 open-label safety extension of the NODE-301 trial. Patients who completed NODE-301 could have enrolled in NODE-302 and received up to an additional 11 doses of etripamil. NODE-302 is a multi- center, open label study designed to evaluate the safety of etripamil nasal spray when self-administered by patients without medical supervision for spontaneous episodes of SVT in an outpatient setting. Eligibility was also contingent on satisfying all inclusion and exclusion criteria, including not experiencing a severe adverse event related to the study drug or the study procedure that precludes the self-administration of etripamil. We completed NODE-302 in late 2020 with a data set of 245 episodes with 105 patients dosed at least once out of 169 patients enrolled. Trial safety results will contribute to the etripamil safety database, and are expected to be available in 2021.
​
NODE-303 is a Phase 3, multi-center, open-label safety trial, evaluating the safety of etripamil when self-administered without medical supervision, and evaluating the treatment safety and efficacy of etripamil on multiple SVT episodes. We originally designed this trial to enroll enough patients to collect data on up to 1,000 patients taking etripamil in an at-home setting. With the expanded size of the RAPID trial, we expect the size of the NODE-303 study to be reduced. We expect to determine a more accurate sizing of the trial following future discussions with the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Based on a review of the NODE-301 safety data available in June 2019, the FDA and multiple European and Latin American regulatory authorities agreed to allow patient enrollment in NODE-303 without an in-office safety test dose, which is required in the RAPID trial, and in a broad patient population including patients taking concomitant beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers.
​
We are in the process of initiating patient access programs that have as their primary objective providing further access to etripamil to patients who have participated in the clinical development registration trials to treat future SVT episodes. These programs will be tailored to meet the regulatory requirements in the territories in which the clinical sites are located.
​
Phase 1 and Phase 2 Trials
​
We completed our Phase 2 clinical trial of etripamil for the treatment of PSVT in the United States and Canada in the electrophysiology lab, with results published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. Investigators reported an 87% termination rate of induced episodes of SVT within 15 minutes at the dose selected for our Phase 3 trials versus a 35% termination rate for placebo.
​
We have completed two Phase 1 clinical trials in healthy volunteers, characterizing the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of etripamil. Our most recent Phase 1 trial (NODE-102) demonstrated no significant differences in etripamil plasma levels or pharmacodynamic outcomes between Caucasian volunteers and subjects of Japanese descent, which was the primary objective of the study. In secondary analyses of all patients, the study showed that the relevant pharmacodynamic effect of 70 mg etripamil for PSVT, as measured by PR interval prolongation, is approximately in the range of 5 to 50 minutes. This period of time is consistent with data on time to conversion of SVT observed in NODE-301. When interpreting an electrocardiogram, the interval between the P wave and the R wave, known as the PR interval, is a measure of conduction over the AV node.
​
Our Strategy
Our goal is to identify, develop and commercialize innovative cardiovascular medicines, including etripamil for the treatment of PSVT, AFib-RVR and other cardiovascular indications, and additional clinical stage compounds for other cardiovascular conditions. The key elements of our business strategy to achieve this goal include the following:

• | Successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval of etripamil for the treatment of PSVT. We are focused on efficiently developing and obtaining approval for etripamil to treat patients with PSVT. We are maintaining our guidance of achieving topline data from the RAPID trial in late 2021 or

early 2022. We intend to first seek regulatory approval in the United States, followed by Europe and other major markets.

• | Expand the scope of cardiovascular indications for etripamil beyond PSVT. We are investigating the use of etripamil for the treatment of patients with AFib-RVR. We believe that etripamil could benefit patients with AFib-RVR based on the approved use of intravenous, or IV, calcium channel blockers in this indication. We began enrollment of our Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial in patients with AFib-RVR in the first quarter of 2021 . We are also exploring the additional cardiovascular opportunities for the use of etripamil. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maximize the value of our programs by maintaining flexibility to commercialize our product candidates independently or through collaborative partnerships. We currently have exclusive development and commercialization rights for etripamil for our initial indications of PSVT and AFib-RVR. We plan to establish commercialization and marketing capabilities using a direct sales force to commercialize etripamil in the United States. Outside of the United States, we are considering commercialization strategies that may include collaborations with other companies. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage our expertise and experience to expand our pipeline of product candidates. We seek to maximize our commercial opportunities by acquiring or in-licensing product candidates for indications with significant unmet need with a focus on novel treatments for cardiovascular conditions. Our leadership team has extensive experience in developing and commercializing successful drugs. We intend to leverage the collective talent within our organization and our network to guide our development plans and pipeline expansion.

Cardiac Conduction
Normal Conduction
Within the right atrium, one of the heart’s upper chambers, sits a specialized structure called the sinus node. The sinus node generates its own electrical signal, which spreads throughout both atria and is transmitted down to the lower chambers, the ventricles, and over another piece of electrical tissue called the atrio-ventricular, or AV, node, which is shown in the figure below. Once the signal reaches the ventricles, it causes them to contract, pumping blood out to the body. Another heartbeat does not occur until a new signal is generated from the sinus node and the cycle repeats. Under normal conditions, passage from the sinus node over the AV node is the only way for the electrical impulse to travel from the atria down to the ventricles.


10



The electrical signal of each heartbeat can be detected by placing sensors known as electrodes over the skin, and recorded over time in a tracing known as an electrocardiogram, or ECG. The ECG measures signal voltage and duration. To the trained interpreter, an ECG conveys a large amount of information about the structure and function of the heart, including among other things, heart rate and rhythm. Under normal physiologic conditions, an ECG has a characteristic pattern of waves corresponding to the electrical activity, contraction and relaxation of each heart chamber. This normal functioning is referred to as sinus rhythm and occurs at a heart rate of between 60 and 100 beats per minute at regular intervals.
As seen in the figure below, the various waves of an ECG tracing corresponding to the events of a single heartbeat are named with the letters P, Q, R, S and T. The interval between the P wave and the R wave, known as the PR interval, is a measure of conduction over the AV node. A normal PR interval is 0.12-0.20 seconds in duration.
ECG Tracing Graph – Event Single Heartbeat
Arrhythmias
A disruption in the heart’s normal rate or rhythm is called an arrhythmia. With an arrhythmia, the heart can beat too quickly, too slowly or with an irregular pattern. A faster than normal heat rate is called tachycardia; a slower than normal heart rate is called bradycardia. Symptoms of an arrhythmia can include palpitations, lightheadedness or dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath or sweating. PSVT and atrial fibrillation are two of the most commonly occurring arrhythmias. While PSVT is characterized by a faster than normal heart rate where the heart beats at regular intervals, with AFib-RVR the heart often beats faster than normal and always with a random, irregular rhythm. Pharmacologic treatment of PSVT focuses on terminating the arrhythmia using an agent to slow conduction over the AV node. With AFib-RVR, there are two approaches to treatment: rate control to reduce the heart rate and rhythm control to restore sinus rhythm and prevent AF recurrences.
Etripamil
We designed and are developing etripamil, a novel, potent, rapid-onset and short-acting calcium channel blocker, as a nasal spray to be administered by the patient to terminate episodes of transient cardiovascular conditions as they occur. Short pharmacological action is sufficient to resolve an episode of SVT. Accordingly, long-lasting drugs that remain in the body at significant concentrations long after the episode is resolved subject patients to unnecessary risk, given the potential for prolonged adverse events. Currently, we are in Phase 3 development for PSVT. We are also developing etripamil to provide rapid rate control for patients with acute symptomatic episodes of atrial fibrillation and are exploring other therapeutic applications where a rapid-onset and short acting non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocking agent could provide patient benefit.

11



In our effort to develop potential therapies, we sought to create new chemical entities as analogs of known molecular classes with clinically validated mechanisms of action. Our goal was to preserve the beneficial pharmacology of existing molecules while altering their pharmacokinetic profile with focused medicinal chemistry to produce drugs that are fast acting and rapidly inactivated. As a result, we created a series of novel non-dihydropyridine L type calcium channel blockers containing chemical ester moieties that preserved the desired pharmacology on the heart but that could be rapidly metabolized and inactivated in the blood by serum esterases. Etripamil resulted from this effort as a new chemical entity with a short relevant pharmacodynamic effect for up to 50 minutes in humans, compared with other calcium channel blockers that have pharmacodynamic effects of several hours.
We believe that the following attributes of etripamil make it a better treatment candidate for certain episodic cardiovascular conditions than current standards of care:

• | Action: Etripamil is designed to act upon the desired target for only up to 50 minutes, with the goal of reducing long-term side effects that may occur with chronic drug therapy.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Absorption: Etripamil is designed to be absorbed into the bloodstream in less than 10 minutes through the inner lining of the nose.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Administration: Etripamil is designed to be self-administered by patients via a nasal spray device.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To better understand the opportunity for etripamil in the United States and Europe, we have commissioned multiple market research studies. In 2017, we commissioned a study that involved qualitative in-depth interviews with 121 cardiologists, electrophysiologists, emergency medicine physicians, primary care physicians, PSVT patients and private and public payors in the United States, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Italy and Spain. In this research, cardiologists in the United States were exposed to a target product profile, or TPP, of etripamil based on our Phase 2 trial results and reported that they would use etripamil in 3.5 times as many PSVT patients as those receiving a catheter ablation, which they report as 10% of their PSVT patients. From the same research, PSVT patients in the United States reported going to the emergency department for approximately 10% of their SVT episodes and anticipated being able to avoid 50% to 75% of these emergency department visits per year by using etripamil. Furthermore, a majority of patients in this research expressed positive expectations for treatment with the etripamil TPP, including that it would provide peace of mind between episodes and a sense of control over the disease, by reducing anxiety in anticipation of future episodes and allowing them to perform activities that they perceived to be limited without a reliable at-home therapy. A minority of patients expressed negative expectations for the etripamil TPP, primarily as a result of an aversion to administering medications intranasally. When presented with hypothetical prices to the patient in the range of $30 to $60 per dose, PSVT patients in this market research also reported a desire to use etripamil for an average of approximately 50% of their SVT episodes.
We commissioned additional market research that was conducted in 2020 after the results of NODE-301 were disclosed with 15 cardiology opinion leaders and 65 clinical cardiologists and electrophysiologists. Sixty of these physicians agreed or strongly agreed that the results of NODE-301 were clinically meaningful. We believe these responses emphasize the need for an efficacious self-administered therapy to reduce ED visits. These same physicians also responded favorably to a target product profile that included a repeat administration of etripamil, such as is being studied in the RAPID trial, with a hypothetical increase in conversion to sinus rhythm at 45 minutes from 60% to 75%, assuming a tolerability profile consistent with the NODE-301 trial. 
We also commissioned market research that was conducted in 2019 with representatives of 20 regional and national commercial/medicare payors and pharmacy benefits managers, or PBMs. In this research, we asked these representatives to evaluate their receptivity to a product profile of etripamil, which assumes a single dose administration and a hypothetical profile of 70% conversion within 30 minutes for etripamil vs 30% for placebo. When presented with a range of hypothetical wholesale acquisition costs to the payors and then asked about the likelihood of coverage of etripamil by commercial and medicare payors if it was approved for PSVT, the representatives on average believed etripamil was highly likely to receive broad reimbursement by both commercial and medicare payors if net pricing was

below the specialty tier pricing threshold for government managed plans, which at the time of the survey was $670 per month. 
​
PSVT
PSVT is a serious and recurring electrical disorder of the heart, which is caused by altered electrical conductivity over the AV node. PSVT refers to a rapid heart rate condition of the heart’s upper chambers (atria) of abrupt onset and termination. In the most common form of PSVT called AV nodal reentrant tachycardia, or AVNRT, there is an extra piece of electrical tissue that allows the electrical signal to travel very rapidly in a circle. As shown in the figure below, when that extra tissue forms within or near the AV node, the signal can now travel down one part of the AV node and up the other in a small circle, sending impulses out to both the atria and ventricles along the way. The cycle continues over and over, resulting in a rapid heart rate.

In the next most common form of PSVT, called atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia, or AVRT, there is an extra piece of electrical tissue that directly connects the atria and the ventricles. In AVRT, the electrical signal begins like it would in a normal heart beat by traveling from the atria to the ventricles over the AV node. However, as shown in the figure above, in AVRT, the extra piece of electrical tissue allows the signal to travel back up to the atria, creating a “short circuit.” Once the signal gets back to the atria, it goes back down to the AV node and the cycle continues over and over, resulting in a rapid heart rate.
Uncertainty of the timing and duration of episodes of SVT can significantly impact patient quality of life. In 2018, we conducted a quantitative internet survey involving 256 patients with PSVT. The survey was designed to assess the impact of PSVT on patients prior to and after their diagnosis and explored the key patient drivers of disease burden, including episode frequency, duration, perceived severity of symptoms and emergency department visits. The survey included both newly diagnosed PSVT patients and patients who had been diagnosed with PSVT for some time. The previously diagnosed patients had an average time since diagnosis of seven years. This survey indicated that it takes more than two years after first experiencing symptoms of PSVT for the average patient to receive a formal diagnosis. We believe this delay in diagnosis is primarily the result of the episodic nature of the disease and the requirement for an ECG when the patient is experiencing an SVT episode to confirm the diagnosis. We estimate that, overall, 60% of PSVT patients are women and approximately half suffer from cardiovascular comorbidities. The figure below shows the surveyed patients’ total number of SVT episodes in the first 12 months after diagnosis.

13



Total Number of SVT Episodes in the First 12 Months After Diagnosis
Patients reported episode frequencies that vary from less than one per year to greater than 25 per year. Based on this market research, we estimate that patients with PSVT experience a median of four to seven episodes of SVT per year. These episodes can be debilitating for patients, who can be left unable to focus on family or work during an episode. When in an episode of SVT, patients may experience symptoms including palpitations, sweating, chest pressure or pain, shortness of breath, sudden onset of fatigue, fainting and anxiety. Symptoms commonly reported by patients with PSVT mimic other conditions and are often mistaken for anxiety or panic attacks, especially in women. Researchers have noted that up to 27% of PSVT patients stopped driving for fear of temporary loss of consciousness, fainting or passing out. Patients have reported that the duration of SVT episodes varies widely from minutes to hours, or more. Our market research indicates that in the year of diagnosis almost 40% of patients experience two or more episodes of SVT per year that last more than 10 minutes each, and a similar percentage visit the emergency department for treatment of their PSVT at least once per year. We also estimate that 65% of PSVT patients have used chronic medications prophylactically to reduce episode frequency. Our market research also shows that after the first year of diagnosis the percentage of patients with SVT episodes lasting longer than 10 minutes and the percentage visiting the emergency department for treatment decreases modestly to approximately one-third of those surveyed. Based upon our survey responses, we believe these decreases in both duration of episodes and emergency department visits are attributable to a combination of prophylactic medication use, lifestyle changes, and proper implementation of vagal maneuvers.
Current Treatment Options for PSVT
Treatment for PSVT depends on the frequency, duration, and severity of the episodes as well as patient preference. Current options for PSVT patients to terminate an episode of SVT include vagal maneuvers, IV medication or external shock delivered in the emergency department. Additionally, some practitioners prescribe oral medications, such as calcium channel blockers, beta blockers and anti-arrhythmic drugs to be taken at the onset of an episode. However, these interventions are generally not acutely effective. Long-term strategies include chronic drug therapy to reduce the frequency of episodes and cardiac ablation to potentially cure the disease. Patients may also elect to not treat their symptoms and simply endure episodes of SVT when they occur.
Vagal maneuvers are commonly attempted to terminate an episode, with low to modest success rates. These are physiological maneuvers that stimulate the vagus nerve, which can terminate an SVT episode. These include gagging, massaging the carotid artery, holding one’s breath and bearing down (Valsalva maneuver), immersing one’s face in ice-cold water, or coughing.

14



Currently approved acute pharmacological therapy for the treatment of an acute episode of SVT includes IV administration of approved AV nodal-blocking agents in an acute care setting. The current standard of care for treatment of episodes of SVT is adenosine, but prior to its approval in 1990, episodes of SVT were treated with IV calcium channel blockers, such as verapamil or diltiazem. When given as a rapid IV bolus, adenosine blocks conduction over the AV node, thereby interrupting the arrhythmia circuit and restoring the heart back to sinus rhythm. Adenosine temporarily stops the heart and patients have reported experiencing chest tightness, flushing and a sense of impending death. Physicians report that patients tell them that they feel like they are going to die. Adenosine is eliminated from the body in less than one minute, but cannot be self-administered as it requires IV access. In-hospital IV administrations are associated with higher healthcare costs, and are also unsettling and inconvenient for the patient. IV calcium channel blockers also slow conduction over the AV node during the course of several minutes. However, they are associated with the risk of excessive slowing of the heart rate and low blood pressure. According to treatment guidelines, patients in the acute care setting who fail pharmacologic treatment for PSVT could then receive direct current cardioversion, where an electric shock is applied to the heart to return it to sinus rhythm.
In an attempt to prophylactically control the frequency and duration of future SVT episodes, many patients will take chronic daily oral medications that modulate AV nodal conduction, such as beta blockers, L-type non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, or antiarrhythmic drugs. Despite chronic daily oral medication, breakthrough SVT episodes that require visits to the emergency department may still occur, albeit for some patients at a reduced frequency. Chronic medication can lead to side effects such as sexual dysfunction or fatigue in the case of beta blockers and constipation in the case of verapamil. Some patients discontinue chronic oral medication due to intolerable side effects. Based on our market research, we estimate that approximately two thirds of PSVT patients have been prescribed chronic medications such as beta blockers or calcium channel blockers to prevent SVT episodes.
The only potentially curative treatment available at the present time for PSVT is ablation, an invasive procedure, which works by directly cauterizing or freezing the short circuit that is the cause of the abnormal rhythm. This is achieved in an electrophysiology lab via catheters that are run through the patient’s groin vessels and into the heart and uses burning or freezing techniques to destroy the heart’s abnormal electrical tissue. Ablation single-procedure success rates for PSVT are reported to be 91% to 96%. However, we estimate that less than 10% of patients with PSVT per year choose this option, which we believe is due primarily to anxiety related to the procedure. Although ablations are generally considered to be safe by the treating community, as with any invasive procedure there are potential complications, which include bleeding, blood clots, pericardial tamponade, and transient or permanent heart block, with the latter requiring permanent pacemaker implantation.
Market Opportunity
We believe that PSVT is a large and under-recognized market that we estimate affects approximately two million Americans and results in over 600,000 healthcare claims in the United States alone per year, including more than 150,000 emergency department visits and hospital admissions and up to 80,000 ablations. Furthermore, we estimate that approximately 300,000 people are diagnosed with PSVT each year in the United States. We derive these estimates from the analysis of longitudinal claims data, which we believe is the most accurate method available to estimate the epidemiology of PSVT. In particular, we analyzed longitudinal Medicare claims data for patients age 65 and older and employer-based medical claims data for patients under age 65 with five or more years of continuous enrollment, for the years 2008 through 2016. We identified patients who, during this time period, had either two or more PSVT codes (ICD9 427.0 or ICD10 I47.1) in the outpatient setting or one or more of these codes in the emergency department or inpatient setting. Another prevalence analysis was published and presented at the 2018 International Academy of Cardiology’s Scientific Sessions. Using four years of longitudinal claims data in patients under age 65, this analysis arrived at similar conclusions regarding the number of PSVT patients in the United States. Both of these analyses were funded by us and included participation by our employees.
Other published sources that attempt to quantify the epidemiology of PSVT, such as the MESA study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology in 1998, and the PREEMPT study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association in 2018, provide important demographic and clinical characteristic data on patients with PSVT. For example, in the MESA study, fewer than 40% of the adjudicated incident cases of PSVT would have been detected had the investigators limited their screening to those patients identified by the PSVT ICD-9 Code (427.0). In 

15



addition, 21% of the incident PSVT patients in the MESA study also had a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (18%) or atrial flutter (6%). As an epidemiology tool, however, we believe these studies underestimate the incidence and prevalence of PSVT due to the episodic nature of the disease as well as the variability in the duration of the episodes, as the investigators in both studies relied only on data from patients presenting to healthcare settings acutely, with the episode confirmed on ECG during the encounter, to estimate the incidence and prevalence of PSVT.
From market research conducted in 2017 and 2018, we estimate a core target addressable market of approximately 40-65% of the prevalent population that we estimate has a higher burden of PSVT as measured by episode frequency and duration, emergency department visits and prophylactic use of chronic medications to reduce episode frequency. We define this core addressable market as patients who have been diagnosed with PSVT and who are engaging the healthcare system for treatment of PSVT, as identified by insurance claims, on an annual basis. Beyond this core addressable market, we believe that there is a significant opportunity for etripamil to help the estimated 1.4 million patients who have been diagnosed with PSVT but do not engage in the healthcare system on an annual basis. We believe many of these patients do not seek treatment for PSVT because they are not satisfied with the current options to manage an acute episode or because they have been told by their physician that their condition is not life threatening and episodes of SVT will eventually self-terminate. We believe that these untreated patients may reengage the healthcare system if alternative treatment options are available to them. In addition, we believe that advances in digital health and wearable technology may lead to more rapid diagnosis of PSVT in the future, resulting in more patients seeking treatment for their symptoms.
Current treatment for PSVT consumes significant healthcare resources. Retrospective research on claims data partly sponsored by us and published in the American Journal of Cardiology in 2020 shows that healthcare expenditures for patients rose significantly in the year prior to PSVT diagnosis, suggesting that increasing symptoms lead patients to seek more medical care. In the year following diagnosis, mean annual healthcare expenditures nearly doubled for those less than 65 years of age and tripled for those over 65 years of age, compared to matched controls, increasing mean health care expenditures by approximately $10,000 in the less than 65 age group to approximately $20,000 per patient in the greater than 65 age group. Significant increases in emergency department visits pre- and post-diagnosis were observed for both age groups. For those less than 65, the average cost of hospitalizations doubled post-diagnosis as their mean number of hospitalizations quadrupled. Of note, catheter ablations following diagnosis represented only 23% of this increased spend in this patient group. 
Looking to the broader landscape of economic burden on our health system from cardiac treatments, a 2021 retrospective study of claims data partly sponsored by us and published in the American Heart Journal found patients less than 65 years of age with PSVT in the first year after diagnosis cost the health care system a comparably similar amount on a per patient basis to patients with atrial fibrillation. This study followed patients for up to six years post-diagnosis. Similar to the previously referenced American Journal of Cardiology study, this data showed that costs never returned to baseline, which we believe indicates a need for more treatment options in long-term PSVT management. 
With regard to total healthcare costs, we estimate from the assessment of claims data that approximately $3 billion is spent each year in the United States on treatments for PSVT, with 58% or $1.9 billion of annual costs being driven by ablation procedures, and 36% or $1.2 billion resulting from emergency department visits, hospitalizations and outpatient hospital visits for PSVT.
Our Clinical Development Program for the Treatment of PSVT
Current treatments do not address the unmet medical need for a rapid-acting, effective, and safe patient-administered treatment that can be taken outside of a hospital or acute care setting at the onset of an SVT episode to restore the heart back to sinus rhythm. We believe that etripamil fills this need. We completed a Phase 1 clinical trial, which supported the selection of four doses of etripamil for Phase 2 development, followed by a Phase 2 clinical trial in adult patients to evaluate the effects of those four doses in patients with PSVT. Both trials were conducted to assess nasally- administered etripamil compared to placebo. Based on discussions with the FDA, we initiated a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial (NODE-301) in July 2018 to assess the efficacy and safety of etripamil in the at-home setting, and released topline data in March of 2020. We have completed a second Phase 1 clinical trial, further characterizing the PK and PD of etripamil in 

16



Japanese and non-Japanese healthy volunteers. We have also completed the conduct portion of an open label Phase 3 safety trial (NODE-302), which provided further drug access to patients that had previously participated in the NODE-301 trial. The primary objective of the NODE-302 trial is to assess the safety of etripamil 70 mg in patients over multiple episodes. We are in the process of analyzing the data from that trial. We are also conducting NODE-303, which is an ongoing open label Phase 3 study that has the objective of collecting further safety data. The FDA has agreed that our Phase 3 clinical program could support an NDA filing in the United States.
Phase 1 Clinical Data
We completed a Phase 1 clinical trial (MSP-2017-1096) in healthy volunteers, which was designed to assess the safety, PK profile, and cardiac pharmacology of intranasally administered etripamil in a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, single ascending dose trial. The primary objective of this trial was to determine the maximum tolerated dose or maximum feasible dose of two different formulations of etripamil administered via the nasal route in healthy, adult male subjects. All doses of etripamil were generally well tolerated, and there was no difference in the safety profile and PK between the two formulations of etripamil, referred to as MSP2017A and MSP2017B. The study of MSP2017A was stopped at 60 mg and MSP2017B was further studied at higher doses (105 mg and 140 mg). The Phase 1 results supported the selection of four doses of etripamil for Phase 2 development. We are using this Phase 1 data to support further clinical development of etripamil in two indications: PSVT and AFib-RVR.
Following nasal administration of etripamil, PK analyses demonstrated rapid absorption and elimination, a dose proportional systemic exposure, or area under the curve, and maximum plasma concentration for etripamil and its primary inactive metabolite. These findings were consistent across a range of seven doses tested up to 140 mg The 140 mg dose was the maximal feasible dose because neither the concentration (350 mg/mL) nor the volume (200 µL) of solution administered in each nostril could be increased. Due to these characteristics of formulation and delivery, a maximum tolerated dose of etripamil was not established. The figure below shows the rapid absorption via the nasal route and the rapid decrease in plasma concentration of etripamil.
​

Phase 1: (MSP-2017-1096) 
Pharmacokinetic Profile of Etripamil Plasma Concentrations
Prolongation of the PR interval as measured by ECGs was taken as the PD measure. A linear relationship was observed between the dose of etripamil and prolongation of the PR interval. The 60 mg, 105 mg, and 140 mg doses demonstrated a 10% or greater PR prolongation, which is shown in the figure below. This correlates with the reported slowing of conduction over the AV node that is necessary to convert an SVT episode to sinus rhythm. Such slowing of conduction has already been observed clinically with IV AV nodal-blocking agents such as adenosine, verapamil, and tecadenoson.

18



Phase 1: (MSP-2017-1096) - Pharmacology
We completed a second Phase 1 trial, NODE-102, comparing the PK and PD of etripamil 35 mg, 70 mg, and 105 mg versus placebo in Japanese and non-Japanese healthy volunteers. Once we determined there was no difference in PK and PD of etripamil between Japanese and non-Japanese participants, we pooled the data from the overall populations into a single dataset. We believe this trial provides further justification for the selected 70 mg dose in our Phase 3 program, and may be used to support further clinical development of etripamil in Japan.
As shown in the figure below, we observed a correlation between the PK profile of etripamil 70 mg, measured by change in PR interval from baseline over time, and the plasma concentrations of etrimpamil. With regard to pharmacodynamics, we believe an approximately 10% increase in the PR interval is a marker of meaningful AV nodal conduction needed to terminate an episode of PSVT. The data as demonstrated on the blue line on the graph below indicates that etripamil 70 mg is potentially impacting AV nodal conduction at meaningful levels for a period up to approximately 50 minutes. 
​

Phase 1: (MSP-2017-1205) NODE-102
As noted in the discussion of the RAPID study below, the RAPID study will incorporate a repeat dose administration regimen of study drug (either 70 mg of etripamil or placebo). Specifically, patients will be instructed to administer a repeat administration of study drug if they have not experienced symptom relief within 10 minutes of the first study drug administration. This tailored regimen utilizes a repeat-dose similar to current PSVT treatment practices with intravenous drugs in the emergency department setting. A similar regimen, using repeat doses of 30 mg etripamil administered 10 minutes apart, was tested in one cohort of the original phase 1 trial (study MSP-2017-1096). As shown in the figure below, this regimen allowed for greater systemic exposure to etripamil in this cohort, as measured by a second maximum concentration after the second administration, as well as a total Area Under the Curve. We believe this data supports the hypothesis underlying our RAPID trial regimen that a second administration will increase bioavailability and result in a greater therapeutic effect.

Phase 1: (MSP-2017-1096) -30 mg etripamil administered 10 minutes apart
Phase 2 Clinical Data
We completed a Phase 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial in the United States and Canada to evaluate the effects of four different doses of etripamil in patients with PSVT. In order to demonstrate the ability of etripamil to terminate SVT in a controlled setting, we conducted the study in the electrophysiology, or EP, laboratory setting, where the SVT episode could be induced in patients scheduled to undergo an EP study and ablation. The primary objective of this trial was to demonstrate the superiority of at least one dose of etripamil over placebo in terminating SVT. The secondary objectives were to determine the minimally effective dose of etripamil, to establish a dose related efficacy trend for etripamil, and to evaluate the safety of etripamil in a clinical setting. The trial was statistically powered at more than 80% to show a 50% absolute difference of etripamil versus placebo.
The trial enrolled 199 patients, of which 95 withdrew prior to dosing: 70 due to inability to induce (n=42) or sustain (n=28) SVT, 5 based on physician discretion, 1 lost to follow up, 1 due to withdrawal of consent, and 18 for other reasons. The mean age of patients was 52.2 years, with the study enrolling patients as young as 19 and as old as 85. As shown in the figure below, SVT was induced and sustained for 5 minutes in 104 patients, who were randomized into one of five dosing cohorts. Four cohorts received active doses of etripamil (35 mg, 70 mg, 105 mg or 140 mg) and one cohort received placebo. All doses of the study drug were delivered in a blind randomized fashion in which healthcare providers administered four 100 µL sprays from four different single spray devices. There were no imbalances in baseline characteristics across the five treatment groups. The mean heart rate in SVT at time 0 was 177 bpm in the placebo group and 168 bpm, 173 bpm, 180 bpm and 155 bpm in the etripamil 35 mg, 70 mg, 105 mg and 140 mg groups, respectively.

21



Phase 2: (MSP-2017-1109) NODE 1 – Clinical Trial Design
The primary endpoint in this clinical trial was the conversion of SVT to sinus rhythm within 15 minutes after administration of etripamil or placebo. As shown in the figure below, the percentage of patients in whom SVT converted to sinus rhythm within 15 minutes of study drug administration was 65% with 35 mg etripamil, 87% with 70 mg, 75% with 105 mg and 95% with 140 mg, compared with 35% in the placebo arm. The three highest doses of etripamil showed statistically significant conversion rates compared with placebo. Statistical significance expresses the probability that the results of a particular study could have occurred purely by chance. Statistical significance is assessed by the FDA and other health regulatory agencies in evaluating marketing approval applications. FDA and other regulatory agencies review the strength of the statistical evidence and whether it supports the claims of the applicant. The primary endpoint, statistical methods for the trial and a p-value boundary for achieving statistical significance for a clinical trial are typically defined before the trial begins. If the probability of observing the calculated statistic is smaller than the p-value boundary, the primary endpoint is considered statistically significant. P-value is a conventional statistical method for measuring the statistical significance of clinical results. A p-value of 0.05 or less represents statistical significance, meaning there is a less than 1in 20 likelihood that the observed results occurred by chance. The FDA utilizes statistical significance, as measured by p-value, as an evidentiary standard of efficacy and typically requires a p-value of 0.05 or less to demonstrate statistical significance.

22



Phase 2: (MSP-2017-1109) NODE 1 - Etripamil Conversion Rates from SVT to Sinus Rhythm
In a post-hoc analysis conducted to help inform our Phase 3 trial design, the patients’ time to conversion to sinus rhythm was examined. As shown in the following Kaplan Meier plot of patients successfully converting to sinus rhythm during the 15 minute study window, the three highest doses of etripamil (140 mg, 105 mg and 70 mg) showed statistically significant shorter time to conversion compared with placebo. The 70 mg dose showed a rapid onset of action with a median time to conversion of less than three minutes after nasal administration of etripamil.
Phase 2: (MSP-2017-1109) NODE 1 – Etripamil Time to Conversion from SVT to Sinus Rhythm
​
Overall, etripamil was well tolerated, and the most common adverse events were related to the nasal route of administration, e.g., nasal irritation or nasal congestion, reported by up to 60% and 45% of patients, respectively, after 

23



etripamil versus none after placebo administration. The 70 mg dose was reported to have 48% nasal irritation and 26% nasal congestion. However, these were transient. Most adverse events were mild (44.2%) or moderate (24.0%) across all treatment groups. At least one adverse event considered related to the study drug, according to the investigator assessment, was reported in 17 (85.0%) patients in the etripamil 35 mg group, 18 (78.3%) in the 70 mg group, 15 (75.0%) in the 105 mg group, 20 (95.2%) in the 140 mg group and 4 (20.0%) in the placebo group. The incidence of adverse events was not dose dependent. Hypotension, or low blood pressure, was reported as an adverse event in two patients, one in the 105 mg dose group of etripamil and one in the 140 mg group.
A total of three patients experienced severe adverse events that were considered possibly related to etripamil. One patient who received a 35mg dose of etripamil experienced facial flushing, shortness of breath, and chest discomfort. One patient who received a 105 mg dose of etripamil had nausea and vomiting, as well as a severe and serious cough. One patient who received a 140 mg dose of etripamil experienced a severe adverse event of second-degree AV block with hypotension beginning five minutes after conversion to sinus rhythm. The AV block resolved after 43 minutes and ablation was subsequently performed. There were no adverse events that led to study discontinuation or death.
Calcium channel blockers have the potential to cause hypotension as a side effect. In our Phase 2 clinical trial, we recorded vital signs, including heart rate and blood pressure, before induction of SVT and every two minutes for 30 minutes after study drug was given. We observed no meaningful reduction in mean blood pressure in the 35 mg or 70 mg etripamil cohorts, but observed a transient decrease in the mean blood pressure in the two highest cohorts, 105 mg and 140 mg. Due to the induction of SVT, the mean systolic blood pressure decreased at time 0 compared to the average at 20 and 10 minutes before SVT induction. Compared to baseline and time 0, systolic blood pressure measurements recorded from 2 minutes to 16 minutes post study drug administration showed no decrease in mean systolic blood pressure in the placebo or 35 mg groups, and maximum mean decreases of 2 mmHg four minutes post dose in the 70 mg group, 17 mmHg six minutes post dose in the 105 mg group, and 20 mmHg six minutes and eight minutes post dose in the 140 mg group.
Based on the combination of efficacy and safety data from our Phase 2 trial, we selected the 70 mg dose of etripamil for our subsequent clinical trials. There was no decrease in mean systolic blood pressure compared to baseline from 16 to 30 minutes post-study drug administration.
Ongoing and Planned Clinical Development of PSVT
In July 2020 we announced that we received guidance from the FDA on our proposal to use data from the outcome of the NODE-301 trial as well as the ongoing RAPID trial. . After discussions with the FDA, we determined that the RAPID trial will be randomized to a placebo controlled double blinded dosing regimen that will permit a second 70 mg dose of etripamil to be administered if symptoms persist for 10 minutes after the first dose. Under an updated statistical analysis plan, the primary efficacy endpoint for both the RAPID trial and the NODE-301 trial will be defined as the difference between active drug and placebo in time to termination of an episode of PSVT and conversion to sinus rhythm within 30 minutes of study drug administration for events confirmed to have been PSVT, with a target p-value of less than 0.05 for each trial. The FDA agreed that the single and repeat administrations of etripamil could be pooled and compared to placebo for the primary analysis, resulting in no increase in the trial’s sample size. The FDA further indicated that the two trials, NODE-301 and RAPID, could potentially fulfill the efficacy requirement for our planned NDA for etripamil in patients with PSVT. 
We also had an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in September 2017 to review our Phase 2 clinical trial results and to discuss our proposed Phase 3 clinical program. The FDA agreed with our proposal to assess the efficacy of etripamil in PSVT patients in the at home setting and suggested that we consider conducting a single pivotal trial to assess the efficacy of etripamil, followed by two open label safety trials. The FDA further confirmed that a large outcome trial would not be required for etripamil and that the total NDA safety database could consist of up to 1,500 patients. We also had a meeting to obtain Scientific Advice from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in April 2018. The EMA agreed that our planned Phase 3 program could support a registration in the European Union but recommended additional safety data in noninduced episodes of SVT.

24



In summary, based on our interactions with the regulatory agencies, our planned Phase 3 clinical program includes:

• | NODE-301, a pivotal efficacy trial to assess the time to conversion of etripamil compared to placebo in the at-home setting;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 3 Clinical Trials
RAPID. The RAPID trial was originally an ongoing trial named NODE-301B and was designed to collect double-blind data from randomized patients who had not yet experienced an SVT event after the NODE-301 study reached its target number of adjudicated SVT events. After receiving guidance from the FDA on our Phase 3 program, we have amended and expanded NODE-301B and renamed it the RAPID trial. The RAPID trial will include the 170 patients who are already enrolled in NODE-301B and is expected to enroll approximately 500 patients. The trial will be completed after a total of 180 confirmed SVT events are reached. Additional patients to be enrolled in the RAPID trial will be randomized 1:1. The graphic below shows the design of the RAPID trial.
Phase 3: (MSP-2017-1138) RAPID – Trial Design
​
(1) Arms C and D (single dose) will be only the patients enrolled under NODE-301 who have had an episode prior to the RAPID Study protocol amendment 
(2) Wilcoxon analysis modeling from NODE-301 data
​
The RAPID study is planned to be conducted in North America and in multiple countries in Europe. The trial was initiated in North America during the fourth quarter of 2020, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The first patient was dosed in November 2020.
NODE-301. NODE-301 is a placebo controlled Phase 3 clinical trial conducted in the United States and Canada to evaluate 70 mg of etripamil versus placebo in terminating an SVT episode in the at-home setting. As shown in the figure below, the primary endpoint is the time to conversion over a five hour monitoring period following the administration of the study drug. Prior to randomization, eligible patients administered a test dose of 70 mg of etripamil in the investigator’s office while in sinus rhythm in order to assess tolerability. Patients successfully completing the test dose were randomly assigned to the etripamil or placebo cohorts (2:1 randomization) and sent home with the study drug and a small portable cardiac monitor to be used during the patient’s subsequent SVT episode. Upon experiencing symptoms of their next SVT episode, patients were instructed to first apply the cardiac monitoring device to record ECG data, then attempt a vagal maneuver, and if that was not successful in terminating the episode, to then administer the drug. Patients’ ECG data was recorded using the cardiac monitoring device for a period of five hours after study drug administration. Patients returned to the clinic for a follow up visit within one week following their SVT event for collection of further information. NODE-301 enrolled 431 patients across 65 sites in the United States and Canada, with 156 patients (107 etripamil, 49 placebo) receiving etripamil for an adjudicated true PSVT episode. 

26



Phase 3: (MSP-2017-1138) NODE-301 Part 1 - Clinical Trial Design 
In March 2020, we reported topline results of the first part of the NODE-301 trial. The first part of NODE-301 did not meet its primary endpoint of time to conversion of SVT to sinus rhythm compared to placebo over the five hour period following study drug administration. The median time to conversion for etripamil was 25 minutes (95% CI: 16, 43) compared to 50 minutes (95% CI: 31,101) for placebo. As shown in the top figure below, despite etripamil’s activity and separation from placebo in the first approximately sixty minutes following study drug administration, a time period consistent with etripamil’s pharmacological activity, results from the latter part of the analysis confounded the statistical analysis of the primary endpoint. We also analyzed the first 30 minutes of the kaplain meir curve, shown in the bottom graph below, and the post hoc results at that time point were a 54% rate of conversion for the etripamil patients and 35% for the placebo patients. The results were statistically significant with a hazard ratio of 1.87 and a p-value of 0.02.

The study demonstrated statistically significant improvements in patients taking etripamil compared to those taking placebo in the secondary endpoint of patient reported treatment satisfaction, as measured by a treatment satisfaction questionnaire for medication (TSQM-9), including global satisfaction (p=0.0069) and effectiveness scores (p=0.0015). Additionally, there was a trend towards improvement in the percentage of patients seeking rescue medical intervention, including in the emergency department, with 15% and 27% etripamil and placebo patients, respectively, reporting such intervention (p=0.12).

28



Phase 3: (MSP-2017-1138) NODE-301 Part 1
Key secondary endpoints from NODE-301 support benefit of etripamil to patients and payors
​
​
NODE302. NODE302 is the open label extension trial of NODE301. We designed NODE302 to evaluate the safety of etripamil when self-administered without medical supervision and to monitor the safety and efficacy of etripamil for the treatment of multiple episodes of SVT.
Patients who have successfully dosed with the study drug in NODE-301 and completed a study closure visit were eligible to enroll in NODE-302 to manage any subsequent episodes of SVT. Eligibility was also contingent on satisfying all inclusion and exclusion criteria, including not experiencing a serious adverse event related to the study drug or the study procedure that precludes the self-administration of etripamil.
We initiated NODE302 in December 2018. The trial completed enrollment in 2020 and data is expected to be available in 2021.The safety results will contribute to the etripamil safety database.
NODE303. NODE-303 is an open-label global safety trial enrolling up to 3,000 patients who did not participate in NODE-301 or NODE-302 in order to collect data on up to 1,000 patients taking etripamil in an at-home setting. We designed NODE-303 to evaluate the safety of etripamil when self-administered without medical supervision, and to evaluate the safety and efficacy of etripamil on multiple SVT episodes. The patients have the opportunity to manage up to four episodes of SVT in NODE-303.
NODE-303 was initiated in October 2019. Based on a review of the NODE-301 safety data available in June 2019, the FDA and multiple European and Latin American regulatory authorities agreed to allow patient enrollment in NODE-303 without an in-office safety test dose and in a broad patient population, including patients taking concomitant betablockers and calcium channel blockers.
Atrial Fibrillation
Atrial fibrillation is a common form of arrhythmia with an irregular and often rapid heart rate that can increase the risk of stroke, heart failure, and other heart-related complications. During AF, the heart’s two upper chambers, the atria, beat chaotically and irregularly—out of coordination with the two lower chambers, the ventricles, of the heart, as shown in the figure below. AF can occur with or without symptoms, with symptoms often including heart palpitations, shortness of breath, and weakness. Episodes of atrial fibrillation can come and go, or patients may have AF that does not resolve. Although the heart arrhythmia in AF itself usually is not life-threatening, it is a serious medical condition that sometimes requires emergency treatment. Additionally, AF is associated with elevated risk of embolism and stroke and 

29



anticoagulant medications, also called blood thinners, are commonly prescribed to manage this risk. Uncertainty around symptom timing and episode length may impact a patient’s quality of life.

Classification of AF is used to determine the appropriate treatment modality for patients. The American Heart Association, or AHA, and the American College of Cardiology, or ACC, categorize AF patients based on disease progression. These categories are defined as follows: paroxysmal ,which involves AF episodes that resolve spontaneously within seven days of symptom onset; persistent, which involves AF episodes that fail to terminate within seven days of symptom onset and require treatment to convert back to sinus rhythm; long-standing persistent, which involves AF atrial fibrillation episodes that last longer than one year despite continued attempts to restore sinus rhythm; and permanent, which involves a joint decision by the treating provider and patient to no longer pursue cardioversion and leave the patient in AF, focusing on rate control and symptom management. Disease progression in AF is common with approximately 25% of AF patients in the paroxysmal stage, 25% of AF patients in the persistent and long-standing persistent stage, and 50% of AF patients in the permanent stage. For purposes of simplicity, we do not differentiate the long-standing persistent classification from the persistent classification as the clinical impact of this differentiation has not been characterized. Concomitant structural heart irregularities including valvular dysfunction and the presence of active symptoms may also help to characterize patients and influence treatment decisions.
A common complication of atrial fibrillation is rapid ventricular rate which is frequently defined as a heart rate of ≥110 beats per minute. Rapid, irregular, and inefficient contractility induced by rapid ventricular rate accounts for hemodynamic instability and symptoms of palpitations. Frequently, new-onset patients with atrial fibrillation present with symptoms related to rapid ventricular rate. 
Current Treatment Options for AF
There are currently two pharmacological approaches to managing atrial fibrillation: rate control to lower a rapid heart rate and rhythm control to restore and maintain a regular (sinus) rhythm and prevent recurrent AF episodes. Either of these pharmacological management approaches may be administered chronically or acutely, depending on patient preference and episode frequency and/or severity. The decision to pursue rate and/or rhythm control for AF episodes is dependent on a variety of factors, including episode severity, episode frequency, patient preference, and safety and tolerability of treatments. Several rhythm control strategies exist, including electrical cardioversion, catheter ablation and anti-arrhythmic drug therapy. For rate control, the rapid heart rate of atrial fibrillation is typically treated with AV nodal blocking drugs (for example, calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, or less commonly digoxin) to control symptoms and improve cardiac function/hemodynamic stability. Oral rate control drugs used acutely do not provide immediate ventricular rate control due to a 30-to-60-minute delayed onset of action. Breakthrough episodes of symptomatic AF often require urgent medical treatment with IV calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers under medical supervision, usually in the emergency department to quickly reduce heart rate before transitioning a patient back to oral therapy. 
The “pill-in-pocket” anti-arrhythmic strategy is described by the AHA and ACC guidelines as the utilization of an oral dose of flecainide or propafenone as an attempt to restore sinus rhythm shortly after the onset of symptomatic atrial fibrillation. Neither drug referenced in the guideline is approved by any regulatory agency for the use outlined in the guideline. Pill-in-pocket rhythm control strategies are considered by physicians for patients who demonstrate favorable 

30



outcomes to these medications in the clinic and who are thought to be reliable enough to administer them appropriately. Initial administration of pill-in-pocket medication is recommended in a monitorable setting due to potential AV node dysfunction or a proarrhythmic response and may be preceded by beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker therapy if the patient is not chronically rate controlled. 
​
Rate controlling agents (for example, calcium channel blockers and beta blockers) may also be administered acutely on an as needed (or PRN) basis. Though the AHA and ACC guidelines do not explicitly acknowledge this approach, participants in market research conducted by us indicate a significant share of patients are managed this way. PRN rate control is more prominently used in paroxysmal patients who do not tolerate chronic medications but experience symptomatic, infrequent AF episodes. Our patient market research from 2018 estimated that approximately 40% of patients use an additional rate control medication to manage acute symptoms of atrial fibrillation. Additionally, our physician market research commissioned in 2021 suggests that both clinical/interventional cardiologists and electrophysiologists prescribe PRN rate control for some of their paroxysmal and persistent patients.
Market Opportunity – AF
The American Heart Association estimates that in 2016 approximately five million people suffered from AF in the United States. This estimate is projected to increase over the next ten years; the AHA suggests a prevalence of seven million by 2030, while the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports this prevalence as increasing to 12 million over the same time period, representing an approximately 6% annual growth rate. We estimate that approximately 25% of these patients have paroxysmal AF, 25% have persistent AF, and 50% have permanent AF. Acute episodes of symptomatic AF are often treated with the approaches described above. However, due to the concerning nature of AF symptoms, patients often present to the emergency department. In the ED, patients are treated with IV calcium channel blockers or beta-blockers to quickly reduce heart rate and/or anti-arrhythmic or electrical cardioversion before transitioning a patient back to oral therapy. According to the Healthcare and Utilization Project, 660,000 patient visits to the emergency department in 2016 were attributed to AF (ICD-10 diagnosis codes I48.0, I48.1, I48.2, I48.91). Additionally, approximately 465,000 patients were admitted to the hospital with AF (same ICD-10 codes).
Our initial qualitative market research indicates that the target addressable market for etripamil in patients with AFib-RVR is approximately 40% of the five million patients with atrial fibrillation. We derive this percentage estimate from a 2021 market research study conducted by us that involved qualitative interviews with a total of 25 electrophysiologists, general cardiologists, and interventional cardiologists. The physicians were asked to estimate the share of patients experiencing ≥1 symptomatic episode of AFib-RVR requiring treatment per year. In response, physicians reported approximately 60% of paroxysmal patients, 50% of persistent patients, and 30% of permanent patients met this classification. This research suggests the share of patients experiencing ≥1 symptomatic episode of AFib-RVR requiring treatment may constitute 40% of the prevalent atrial fibrillation population on a weighted average basis. 
We believe that etripamil has the potential to be developed such that it can be used by patients to rapidly reduce their heart rate in the at-home setting to provide a supplemental option to the acute oral rate or rhythm control strategy their physician has already prescribed. When presented with a target product profile reflecting this potential use case, approximately two thirds of the physicians in the 2021 market research study perceived utility in the product profile, , which would serve as a “bridge” to the onset of acute oral agents. According to physicians, it can takes hours for patients to feel an alleviation of symptoms using acute oral rate and rhythm control. During this time, patients may experience frightening symptoms that often prompt them to seek emergent care. We believe that the combination of convenient delivery, potency, rapid-onset and short duration of action of etripamil has the potential to move the current treatment setting for some acute episodes of AFib-RVR out of the burdensome and costly emergency department.
Current atrial fibrillation management consumes significant healthcare resources in the United States. The American Heart Association published a report in 2016 summarizing the current and projected cost burden of cardiovascular diseases in the United States. This report suggests atrial fibrillation resulted in $25 billion in direct medical costs in 2016 (~7% of all cardiovascular diseases) and another $7 billion in indirect costs (i.e., $32 billion in total costs). Additionally, the forecasted growth in atrial fibrillation prevalence is anticipated to result in healthcare expenditures of $46 billion in direct costs and $10 billion in indirect costs in the United States by 2030.

Clinical Development Plan for Atrial Fibrillation
We began enrollment in our Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial in the first quarter of 2021to evaluate the potential effectiveness of etripamil to reduce ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular rate for whom IV administered calcium channel blockers have been used effectively. The Phase 2 double blind, placebo controlled, proof-of-concept, which will be conducted in Canada in collaboration with the Montreal Heart Institute and other research centers, is expected to enroll approximately 50 patients randomized 1:1 to receive either 70 mg of etripamil nasal spray or placebo. The primary endpoint will assess reduction in ventricular rate, with key secondary endpoints including the time to achieve the maximum reduction in rate and the duration of the effect.The trial is to be conducted in the hospital or emergency department setting under medical supervision. We anticipate reporting data from this study following disclosure of top line results of the RAPID trial.
​
Etripamil in Other Therapeutic Applications
Our goal in expanding our pipeline around etripamil is to apply the same paradigm-changing aspiration that we have for supraventricular tachycardias like PSVT and AF to other cardiac and potentially non-cardiac conditions where we believe that a rapid-onset, short-acting dihydropyridine L-type calcium channel blocker could potentially deliver significant clinical and quality of life benefits for patients. We believe that the same insights that led to the development of etripamil for the treatment of PSVT are relevant in other indications where AV-nodal blocking agents with blood vessel widening activity have demonstrated clinical utility. Both calcium channel blockers and beta blockers are commonly used to manage not only supraventricular tachycardias like PSVT or AF, but also for the treatment of chronic stable angina and angina due to coronary artery spasm. 
Sales and Marketing
Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial sales and marketing organization or distribution capabilities. We currently have exclusive global development and commercialization rights for etripamil for all indications that we may pursue and believe that we can maximize the value of etripamil by retaining commercialization rights in the United States and entering into collaboration agreements for certain territories outside the United States. Our current strategy is to market etripamil in the United States for the treatment of PSVT using a targeted direct sales force focused on clinical cardiologists, electrophysiologists, and high-volume primary care physicians who have a history of prescribing anti-arrhythmic therapies. We believe that a majority of PSVT patients are managed by these cardiovascular specialists and that a targeted sales force will be able to reach a substantial portion of the market for etripamil.
Manufacturing
We currently rely on third party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for all of our required raw materials, nasal spray device, API and finished product for our clinical trials and for our preclinical research. We require all of our CMOs to conduct manufacturing activities in compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements. We have assembled a team of experienced employees and consultants to provide the necessary technical, quality and regulatory oversight over our CMOs and have implemented a comprehensive plan for audits of our CMOs. Currently, we have development contracts and quality agreements with our CMOs for the manufacturing of etripamil drug substance and drug product. We currently have enough manufactured supply of etripamil to complete our ongoing registration trials. We also may elect to pursue additional CMOs for manufacturing supplies of regulatory starting materials in the future and for the filling of the nasal spray device, labeling, packaging, storage and distribution of investigational drug products. We plan to continue to rely on third party manufacturers for any future trials and commercialization of etripamil, if approved. We anticipate that these CMOs will have capacity to support commercial scale production, but we do not have any formal agreements at this time with these CMOs to cover commercial production. We believe we can identify and establish additional CMOs to provide API and finished drug product without significant disruption to our business or clinical development timelines. If etripamil is approved by any regulatory agency, we intend to enter into agreements with a third party contract manufacturer and one or more backup manufacturers for the commercial production of etripamil.

Competition
Drug development is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological advancements. Our ability to compete will significantly depend upon our ability to complete necessary clinical trials and regulatory approval processes, and effectively market any drug that we may successfully develop. Our current and potential future competitors include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and government agencies. The primary competitive factors that will affect the commercial success of etripamil or any other product candidate for which we may receive marketing approval include efficacy, safety, tolerability, dosing convenience, price, coverage and reimbursement. Many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, as well as in obtaining regulatory approvals of those product candidates in the United States and in foreign countries.
Our current and potential future competitors may also have significantly more experience commercializing drugs that have been approved for marketing. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries could result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of our competitors.
Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining regulatory approval for therapies and in achieving widespread market acceptance of their drugs. It is also possible that a competitor may develop a cure or more effective treatment method for the diseases we are targeting, which could render our current or future product candidates non-competitive or obsolete, or reduce the demand for our product candidates before we can recover our development and commercialization expenses.
We are not aware of any approved drug or any drug candidate in clinical development for a patient with PSVT to self-administer treatment to terminate SVT episodes. In the acute setting, IV treatments of generic drugs such as adenosine, verapamil and diltiazem, are routinely given. Additionally, some practitioners prescribe oral medications, such as calcium channel blockers, beta blockers and antiarrhythmics to be taken at the onset of an episode. However, these interventions are not acutely effective and are not approved by the FDA or other regulatory agencies for this use.
For atrial fibrillation, there are a number of marketed generic anti-arrhythmic drugs that are used for chronic and/or acute rate control, such as metoprolol, propranolol, esmolol, pindolol, atenolol, nadolol, verapamil and diltiazem. We are aware of several drugs or new formulations of existing drugs under development or recently under development for atrial fibrillation, including InRhythm (flecainide), a sodium channel blocker in Phase II from InCarda Therapeutics, Inc., and Gencaro (bucindolol hydrochloride), a beta blocker in Phase 2 from ARCA biopharma, Inc. 
Intellectual Property
We have filed numerous patent applications pertaining to etripamil and possible future product candidates, formulations containing etripamil, methods of making such formulations and clinical use. We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, invention and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business by seeking, maintaining, and defending our intellectual property. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our position in the field of cardiac arrhythmias, such as PSVT, and immediate rate control in atrial fibrillation, as well as other medical conditions affecting the cardiovascular system. Additionally, we intend to rely on regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity and market exclusivity, as well as patent term extensions, where available.
As of March 9, 2021, our patent portfolio as it pertains to etripamil included: 
•      a patent family containing six U.S. patents, projected to expire in 2028, a pending U.S. patent application, which, if granted, is projected to expire in 2028, as well as corresponding patents in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand and South Korea, directed to etripamil, pharmaceutical compositions including etripamil, and uses of etripamil such as to treat angina or cardiac arrhythmias, including PSVT and atrial fibrillation; and 

33



•      a patent family containing one U.S. patent, projected to expire in 2036, a pending U.S. patent application, which, if granted, is projected to expire in 2036, as well as corresponding patents in Australia, Europe, Hong Kong, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and Ukraine and corresponding patent applications in Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Israel, New Zealand, South Africa, and South Korea, directed to formulations including etripamil, methods of making such formulations, and uses of such formulations to treat angina or cardiac arrhythmias, such as PSVT and atrial fibrillation. 
The terms of individual patents may vary based on the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for applications filed in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date in the absence, for example, of a terminal disclaimer shortening the term of the patent or patent term adjustment increasing the term of the patent. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a results of FDA regulatory review periods. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of patents outside the United States varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest non-provisional filing date.
In addition to patents and patent applications that we own, we rely on know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, and obtain and maintain ownership of certain technologies, in part, through confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners.
Our future commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; and operate without infringing valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents that cover these activities. With respect to our owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will issue from any of the pending patent applications to which we own or from any patent applications that we may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be issued in the future to us will be commercially useful in protecting etripamil or any future product candidates and methods of using or manufacturing the same. Moreover, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for certain aspects of etripamil or future product candidates generally, as well as with respect to certain indications. See the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local levels, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
United States Government Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the drug development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve a pending New Drug Application, or NDA, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or 

34



partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well controlled clinical trials, in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of selected clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees; and
--+--------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold.
In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within 

35



specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an initial indication of its effectiveness. In Phase 2, the drug typically is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. In Phase 3, the drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the safety and efficacy of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted, at least annually, to the FDA, and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements, or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Marketing Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.
The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.

36



The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
The testing and approval process for an NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and takes several years to complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval of an NDA on a timely basis, or at all.
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs
The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, accelerated approval, priority review, and breakthrough therapy designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. The FDA may review sections of the NDA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted. If the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.

37



The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that are designed to treat serious conditions, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the current PDUFA agreement, these six and ten month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for fast track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures.
Breakthrough therapy designation is for a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate.
Rare pediatric disease designation by the FDA enables priority review voucher, or PRV, eligibility upon U.S. market approval of a designated drug for rare pediatric diseases. The RPD-PRV program is intended to encourage development of therapies to prevent and treat rare pediatric diseases. The voucher, which is awarded upon NDA or BLA approval to the sponsor of a designated RPD can be sold or transferred to another entity and used by the holder to receive priority review for a future NDA or BLA submission, which reduces the FDA review time of such future submission from ten to six months.
Post Approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or other labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a boxed warning, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the 

38



potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.
Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, although physicians, based on their independent medical judgement, may prescribe approved drugs for unapproved indications. However, biopharmaceutical companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with the labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting their promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative liability.
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
Federal and State Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security, and Transparency Laws and Regulations
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our current and future business operations, including our clinical research activities, and proposed sales, marketing and education programs and constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships with healthcare providers and other parties through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval. These 

39



laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations, data privacy and security, and transparency laws and regulations, including, without limitation, those laws described below.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated.
A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties laws.
Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which can be enforced by individuals through civil whistleblower and qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalties laws, prohibits any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose specified requirements on certain types of individuals and entities relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, healthcare clearinghouse and health plans, that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity, and their covered subcontractors. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which are not pre-empted by HIPAA, differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.

The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report such information regarding payments and other transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives provided during the previous year.
We may also be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information on the pricing of certain drugs, and state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties including damages, fines, imprisonment, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, implementation of corporate compliance programs, reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals, and additional data privacy and security requirements.
Coverage and Reimbursement
The future commercial success of our, or any of our collaborators’, product candidates, if approved, will depend in part on the extent to which third-party payors, such as governmental payor programs at the federal and state levels, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors, provide coverage of and establish adequate reimbursement levels for our product candidates. Third-party payors generally decide which products they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels for those products. In particular, in the United States, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists. Private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide coverage and reimbursement for products based on the level at which the government, through the Medicare program, provides coverage and reimbursement for such products, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.
In the United States, the European Union, or EU, and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of products, particularly for new and innovative products, which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the EU will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical coverage and reimbursement policies and pricing in general.

Third-party payors are increasingly imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage and limiting reimbursement levels for products. For example, federal and state governments reimburse products at varying rates generally below average wholesale price. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of products. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of products, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our product candidates, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party payor reimbursement may not be available to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government insurance programs may result in lower reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved, or exclusion of our product candidates from coverage and reimbursement. The cost containment measures that third-party payors and providers are instituting and any healthcare reform could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved product candidates.
Healthcare Reform
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering enacting or have enacted a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably, if approved. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts, which include major legislative initiatives to reduce the cost of care through changes in the healthcare system, including limits on the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded health care programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing.
There have been several U.S. government initiatives over the past few years to fund and incentivize certain comparative effectiveness research, including creation of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the PPACA. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates.
The PPACA became law in March 2010 and substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both third-party payors. Among other measures that may have an impact on our business, the PPACA establishes an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program; and a new formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Additionally, the PPACA extends manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability, expands eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs, and expands entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service Act. At this time, we are unsure of the full impact that the PPACA will have on our business.
There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA.While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the PPACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, included a provision that repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the PPACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the PPACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the PPACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit 

42



upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the PPACA are invalid as well. The United States Supreme Court is currently reviewing this case, but it is unknown when a decision will be reached. Although the U.S. Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of the PPACA, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the PPACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the PPACA. It is unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the PPACA.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. In August 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, which, among other things, included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which began in 2013 and, following passage of subsequent legislation, including the BBA, will continue through 2030 with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was enacted and, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
Further, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempted to implement several of the administration’s proposals. As a result, the FDA also released a final rule on September 24, 2020, effective November 30, 2020, implementing a portion of the importation executive order providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed pending review by the Biden administration until March 22, 2021. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing the Trump administration’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. It is unclear whether the Biden administration will work to reverse these measures or pursue similar policy initiatives. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. It also possible that governmental action will be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic..
Foreign Regulation
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. For example, in the EU, we must obtain authorization of a clinical trial application, or CTA, in each member state in which we intend to conduct a 

43



clinical trial. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a drug, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the drug in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
