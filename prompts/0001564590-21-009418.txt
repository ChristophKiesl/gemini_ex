SYKES provides differentiated full lifecycle customer experience management solutions and services primarily to Global 2000 companies and their end customers principally in the financial services, technology, communications, transportation & leisure and healthcare industries. Our differentiated full lifecycle services platform effectively engages customers at every touchpoint within the customer journey, including digital media and acquisition, sales expertise, customer service, technical support and retention, many of which can be optimized through a suite of digital transformation capabilities under our SYKES Digital Services (“SDS”) group, which spans robotic process automation (“RPA”), self-service, insight analytics and digital learning.  In addition to digital transformation, SYKES also provides artificial intelligence (“AI”) solutions that can be embedded and leveraged across its lifecycle offerings. We serve our clients through two geographic operating regions: the Americas (United States, Canada, Latin America, Australia and the Asia Pacific Rim) and EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa). Our Americas and EMEA regions primarily provide customer management solutions and services with an emphasis on inbound multichannel demand generation, customer service and technical support to our clients’ customers. These services are delivered through multiple communication channels including phone, e-mail, social media, text messaging, chat and digital self-service. We also provide various enterprise support services in the United States that include services for our clients’ internal support operations, from technical staffing services to outsourced corporate help desk services. In Europe, we also provide fulfillment services, which include order processing, payment processing, inventory control, product delivery and product returns handling. (See Note 25, Segments and Geographic Information, of the accompanying “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for further information on our segments.) Additionally, through our acquisition of RPA provider Symphony Ventures Ltd (“Symphony”) coupled with our investment in AI through XSell Technologies, Inc. (“XSell”), we also provide a suite of digital transformation capabilities that optimizes our differentiated full lifecycle management services platform. Our complete service offering helps our clients acquire, retain and increase the lifetime value of their customer relationships. We have developed an extensive global reach with customer experience management centers across six continents, including North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Australia and Africa.

 Recent Developments
 Coronavirus
 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) a pandemic. The global nature, rapid spread and continually evolving response by governments throughout the world to combat the spread has had a negative impact on the global economy. Certain of our customer experience management centers have been impacted by local government actions restricting facility access or are operating at lower capacity utilization levels to achieve social distancing. We are committed to the health and safety of our workforce and ensuring business continuity for the brands we serve. In response, we have shifted as many employees as possible to a work-at-home model. As of January 2021, approximately 95% of agents assigned to our brick-and-mortar facilities are working at our centers or from home across the world with 70% having transitioned to a work-at-home model. Approximately 
 3

5% of our agents are idle primarily due to the lack of technical infrastructure to work from home. Our operations in the Philippines, El Salvador and Mexico have been most impacted by the governmental restrictions.
 We continue to closely monitor the prevalence of COVID-19 in the communities where our centers are located as well as guidance from public health authorities, federal and local agencies and municipalities. We will work with employees and clients to transition agents back to our centers based on that guidance, but risk further disruption to our business as a result of COVID-19 and government-imposed restrictions.
 Exit of Leased Space
 We are reevaluating our real estate footprint in connection with a transition of a portion of our workforce to a permanent remote working environment in both the Americas and EMEA. We have decided to terminate, sublease or abandon leases prior to the end of their lease terms at certain of our sites during the year ended December 31, 2020 as approximately 3,200 seats transitioned from brick and mortar to at home agents. As such, we recorded impairments of right-of-use (“ROU”) assets of $12.7 million and impairments of property and equipment of $7.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. See Note 6, Fair Value, in the accompanying “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for further information. Annualized lease expense savings of approximately $10.3 million and reduced depreciation expense of approximately $3.0 million are expected from these actions. Of the $10.3 million in expected annualized lease savings, approximately 70% is anticipated to be realized as cash savings.  
Americas 2019 Exit Plan
 During the first quarter of 2019, we initiated a restructuring plan to simplify and refine our operating model in the United States (“U.S.”) (the “Americas 2019 Exit Plan”), in part to improve agent attrition and absenteeism. The Americas 2019 Exit Plan included the closure of customer experience management centers, the consolidation of leased space in various locations in the U.S. and management reorganization. We finalized the actions under the Americas 2019 Exit Plan as of September 30, 2019.
Acquisitions
 On December 31, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Taylor Media Corp. (“TMC”), a personal finance digital media company and owner of The Penny Hoarder. Of the total initial purchase price of $104.8 million, subject to a post-closing working capital adjustment, $87.2 million was paid upon closing using $63.0 million of additional borrowings under our credit agreement as well as cash on hand. Of the remaining $17.6 million of the purchase price, $0.2 million will go to repay outstanding debt and $17.4 million of the purchase price was deferred and is payable on December 31, 2027, the seventh anniversary of the closing. In the event TMC’s previous owner remains employed by the Company or one of its subsidiaries on December 31, 2022, the second anniversary of the closing, the deferred payment will be accelerated and due at that time. TMC’s assets and liabilities have been reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 in the Americas segment and the results of TMC’s operations will be reflected in our consolidated financial statements beginning on January 1, 2021.
 On November 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Symphony, a provider of RPA services, offering RPA consulting, implementation, hosting and managed services for front, middle and back-office processes. Of the total initial purchase price of GBP 52.5 million ($67.6 million), GBP 44.6 million ($57.6 million) was paid upon closing using cash on hand as well as $31.0 million of borrowings under our credit agreement.  The acquisition date present value of the remaining GBP 7.9 million ($10.0 million) of the purchase price was deferred and payable in equal installments over three years, on or around November 1, 2019, 2020 and 2021. Subsequent to the finalization of the working capital adjustment, the purchase price was adjusted to GBP 52.4 million ($67.5 million). The results of Symphony’s operations have been reflected in our consolidated financial statements since November 1, 2018.
 On July 9, 2018, we completed the acquisition of WhistleOut Pty Ltd and WhistleOut Inc. (together, “WhistleOut”).  WhistleOut is a consumer comparison platform focused on mobile, broadband and pay TV services, principally across Australia and the U.S. The acquisition broadens our digital media capabilities geographically and extends our home services product portfolio. The total purchase price of AUD 30.2 million ($22.4 million) was funded through $22.0 million of additional borrowings under our credit agreement. Subsequent to the finalization of the working capital adjustment, the purchase price was adjusted to AUD 30.3 million ($22.5 million).  The results of WhistleOut’s operations have been reflected in our consolidated financial statements since July 9, 2018.

 Industry Overview 
 The customer experience management solutions and services industry, includes services such as digital media and demand generation, customer acquisition, customer support, customer retention, digital transformation, RPA, self-service, insight analytics and digital learning. According to Everest Group, an industry research firm, the outsourced portion of the customer experience management solutions and services industry worldwide was estimated to be between $83 billion and $85 billion, growing at rate of approximately 1% from 2017 to 2020 due to COVID-19 related lockdowns impacting consumer confidence and economic activity.
 We believe that growth for broader outsourced customer experience management solutions and services will be fueled by the trend of Global 2000 companies and medium-sized businesses utilizing outsourcers. In today’s marketplace, companies increasingly are seeking a comprehensive suite of innovative full lifecycle customer experience management solutions and services that allow them to acquire customers, enhance the end user’s experience with their products and services, strengthen and enhance their company brands, maximize the lifetime value of their customers through retention and up-sell and cross-sell, efficiently and effectively deliver human interactions when and where customers value it most, and deploy best-in-class customer management strategies, automation processes and technologies. However, a myriad of factors, among them intense global competition, pricing pressures, softness in the global economy and rapid changes in technology, continue to make it difficult for companies to cost-effectively maintain the in-house personnel necessary to handle all of their customer experience management needs. 
 To address these needs, we offer multichannel demand generation and comprehensive global customer experience management solutions and services that leverage brick-and-mortar and at-home agent delivery infrastructure as well as digital transformational capabilities and AI.  We provide consistent high-value support for our clients’ customers across the globe in a multitude of languages, leveraging our dynamic, secure communications infrastructure and our global footprint that reaches across 21 countries. This global footprint includes established brick-and-mortar operations in both onshore and offshore geographies where companies have access to high-quality customer experience management solutions at lower costs compared to other markets.  We further complement our brick-and-mortar global delivery model with a highly differentiated and ready-made best-in-class at-home agent delivery model.  In addition, we provide digital self-service customer support and automation that differentiates our go-to-market strategy as it expands options for companies to best service their customers in their channel of choice to deliver an “effortless customer experience.”  By working in partnership with outsourcers, companies can ensure that the crucial task of acquiring, growing and retaining their customer base is addressed while creating operating flexibility, enabling focus on their core competencies, ensuring service excellence and execution, achieving cost savings through a variable cost structure, leveraging scale, entering niche markets speedily, and efficiently allocating capital within their organizations.
 Business Strategy
 Broadly speaking, our value proposition to our clients is that of a trusted partner, which provides full lifecycle global customer experience management services, multichannel demand generation, digital transformation and AI capabilities primarily to Global 2000 companies that drive customer acquisition, differentiation, brand loyalty and increased lifetime value of end customer relationships. By outsourcing their customer acquisition and service solutions to us, clients are able to achieve exceptional customer experience and drive tangible business impact with greater operational flexibility, enhanced revenues, lower operating costs and faster speed to market, all of which are at the center of our value proposition. At a tactical level, we deliver on this value proposition through consistent delivery of operational and client excellence. Our business strategy is to leverage this value proposition in order to capitalize on and increase our share of the large and underpenetrated addressable market opportunity for customer experience management solutions and services worldwide. We believe through successful execution of our business strategy, we could generate a healthy level of revenue growth and drive targeted long-term operating margins. To deliver on our long-term growth potential and operating margin objectives, we need to manage the key levers of our business strategy, the principles of which include the following:
 Build Long-Term Client Relationships Through Customer Service Excellence. We believe that providing high-value, high-quality service is critical in our clients’ decisions to outsource and in building long-term relationships with our clients. To ensure service excellence and consistency across each of our centers globally, we leverage a portfolio 
 5

of techniques, including SYKES Science of Service®. This standard is a compilation of more than 30 years of experience and best practices. Every customer experience management center strives to meet or exceed the standard, which addresses leadership, hiring and training, performance management down to the agent level, forecasting and scheduling, and the client relationship including continuous improvement, disaster recovery plans and feedback. 
 Increasing Share of Seats Within Existing Clients and Winning New Clients. We provide customer experience management solutions and services to primarily Global 2000 companies. With this large target market, we have the opportunity to grow our client base while we also selectively target new economy or disrupter clients. We strive to achieve this by winning a greater share of our clients’ in-house seats as well as gaining share from our competitors by providing consistently high-quality service as clients continue to consolidate their vendor base. In addition, as we further integrate the recently acquired RPA and AI capabilities with digital media and leverage it across our brick-and-mortar and at-home agent delivery platforms both domestically and internationally within our vertical markets mix, we plan to win new clients as a way to broaden our base of growth.
 Diversifying Verticals and Expanding Service Lines.  To mitigate the impact of any negative economic and product cycles on our growth rate, we continue to seek ways to diversify into verticals and service lines that have countercyclical features and healthy growth rates.  We are targeting the following verticals for growth:  financial services, communications, technology, transportation & leisure, healthcare, and other, which includes retail.  These verticals cover various business lines, including credit card/consumer fraud protection, fintech, ecommerce platforms, online gaming, wireless services, broadband, media, retail banking, consumer and high-end enterprise tech support and travel, telemedicine and soft and hard goods online and through brick and mortar retailers. 
 Maximizing Capacity Utilization Rates and Strategically Adding Seat Capacity. Revenues and profitability growth are largely driven by increasing the capacity utilization rate in conjunction with seat capacity additions. We plan to sustain our focus on increasing the capacity utilization rate by further penetrating existing clients, adding new clients and rationalizing underutilized seat capacity as deemed necessary. With greater operating flexibility resulting from our at-home agent delivery model, we believe we can rationalize underutilized capacity more efficiently and drive capacity utilization rates.  
 Broadening At-Home Agent and Brick-and-Mortar Global Delivery Footprint. Just as increased capacity utilization rates and increased seat capacity are key drivers of our revenues and profitability growth, where we deploy both the seat capacity and the at-home agent delivery platform geographically is also important. By broadening and continuously strengthening our brick-and-mortar global delivery footprint and our at-home agent delivery platform, we believe we are able to meet both our existing and new clients’ customer experience management needs globally as they enter new markets. At the end of 2020, our at-home agent delivery capability and global delivery brick-and-mortar footprint spanned 21 countries.
 Creating Value-Added Service Enhancements.  To improve both revenue and margin expansion, we intend to continue to introduce new service offerings and add-on enhancements.  Digital media and demand generation, multilingual customer support, digital self-service support, back office services, RPA and AI are examples of horizontal service offerings, while data analytics and process improvement products are examples of add-on enhancements. Additionally, with the proliferation of on-line communities, such as Facebook and Twitter, we continue to make on-going investments in our social media service offerings, which can be leveraged across both our brick-and-mortar and at-home agent delivery platforms.
 Continuing to Focus on Expanding the Addressable Market Opportunities.  As part of our growth strategy, we continually seek to expand the number of markets we serve. The United States, Canada and Germany, for instance, are markets which are served by in-country centers, centers in offshore regions or a combination thereof. We continually seek ways to broaden the addressable market for our customer experience management services. We currently operate in 14 markets.
 Continue to Grow Our Business Organically, through Strategic Investments and Partnerships, and through Acquisitions. We have grown our customer experience management solutions and services utilizing a combination of internal organic growth, strategic investments and partnerships, and external acquisitions. Our organic growth, partnership and acquisition strategies are to target markets, clients, verticals, delivery geographies and service mix that will expand our addressable market opportunity, and thus drive our organic growth. Entry into the Philippines, El Salvador, Romania, Colombia and Cyprus are examples of how we leveraged these delivery geographies to further 
 6

penetrate both existing and new clients, verticals and service mix in order to drive organic growth. While the Alpine Access, Inc. (“Alpine”), Qelp B.V. (“Qelp”), Clear Link Holding, LLC (“Clearlink”), Symphony and TMC acquisitions are examples of how we used acquisitions to augment our service offerings and differentiate our delivery model. The ICT Group, Inc. (“ICT”) acquisition is an example of how we used an acquisition to gain overall size and critical mass in key verticals, clients and geographies.  In 2017, we made a strategic investment in XSell, which allows us to optimize the sales performance capabilities of a broader base of agents as compared to what has historically been an extremely narrow base by leveraging machine learning and AI algorithms. As customer experience management programs increasingly incorporate up-selling and cross-selling, and measures based on sales conversion, XSell’s targeted offering can be leveraged across both chat and voice channels, across traditional customer experience management opportunities, and the Clearlink platform to digitally enhance sales performance and conversion either on behalf of or direct to clients through branded search, organic search and integrated marketing agency perspectives. 
 Services
 We specialize in providing differentiated full lifecycle customer experience management solutions and services primarily to Global 2000 companies and their end customers at key touchpoints on a global basis. These services include digital media, demand generation, customer acquisition, customer support, technical support, up-selling, cross-selling and retention.  Our comprehensive customer experience management solutions and services are provided through two reportable segments — the Americas and EMEA. The Americas region, representing 80.7% of consolidated revenues in 2020, includes the United States, Canada, Latin America, Australia and the Asia Pacific Rim. The sites within Latin America and the Asia Pacific Rim are included in the Americas region as they provide a significant service delivery vehicle for U.S.-based companies that are utilizing our customer experience management solutions and services in these locations to support their customer care needs. The EMEA region, representing 19.3% of consolidated revenues in 2020, includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Both regions include revenues from our at-home agent delivery solution. See Note 25, Segments and Geographic Information, of the accompanying “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for further information on our segments. The following is a description of our customer experience management solutions and services: 
 Outsourced Customer Experience Management Solutions and Services. Our outsourced customer experience management solutions and services represented 98.7%, 97.7% and 99.0% of total 2020, 2019 and 2018 consolidated revenues, respectively. We provide phone, e-mail, social media, text messaging, chat and digital self-service support throughout the Americas and EMEA regions utilizing our advanced technology infrastructure, human resource management skills and industry experience.

Operations 
 Customer Experience Management Centers. We operate across 21 countries in 67 customer experience management centers, which breakdown as follows: 23 centers across EMEA, 15 centers in the United States, one center in Canada, three centers in Australia and 25 centers offshore, including the People’s Republic of China, the Philippines, Costa Rica, El Salvador, India, Mexico, Brazil and Colombia.
 We utilize a sophisticated workforce management system to provide efficient scheduling of personnel. Our internally developed digital private communications network complements our workforce by allowing for effective call volume management and disaster recovery backup. Through this network and our dynamic intelligent call routing capabilities, we can rapidly respond to changes in client call volumes and move call volume traffic based on agent availability and skill throughout our network of centers, improving the responsiveness and productivity of our agents. We also can offer cost competitive solutions for taking calls to our offshore locations. 
 Our data warehouse captures and downloads customer experience management information for reporting on a daily, real-time and historical basis. This data provides our clients with direct visibility into the services that we are providing for them. The data warehouse supplies information for our performance management systems such as our agent scorecarding application, which provides us with information required for effective management of our operations. 
 Our customer experience management centers are protected by a fire extinguishing system, backup generators with significant capacity and 24-hour refueling contracts and short-term battery backups in the event of a power outage, reduced voltage or a power surge. Rerouting of call volumes to other customer experience management centers is also available in the event of a telecommunications failure, natural disaster or other emergency. Security measures are imposed to prevent unauthorized physical access. Software and related data files are backed up daily and stored off site at multiple locations. We carry business interruption insurance covering interruptions that might occur as a result of certain types of damage to our business. 
 Robotic Process Automation. We have a total of approximately 180 RPA consultants, sales and marketing associates operating through offices in the Asia Pacific Rim, Europe, North America and Latin America.
 Fulfillment Centers. We currently have one fulfillment center located in Europe. We provide our fulfillment services primarily to certain clients operating in Europe who desire this complementary service in connection with outsourced customer experience management services. 
 Enterprise Support Services Office. Our U.S. enterprise support services office provides recruitment services for high-end knowledge workers, a local presence to service major accounts, and outsourced corporate help desk solutions. 
Sales and Marketing 
 Our sales and marketing objective is to leverage our vertical expertise, global presence, and end-to-end lifecycle of service offerings to develop long-term relationships with existing and future clients. Our customer experience management solutions have been developed to help our clients market, acquire, retain and increase the lifetime value of their customer relationships. Our plans for increasing our visibility and impacting the market include the launch of new service offerings in digital support and digital media, participation in market-specific industry associations, trade shows and seminars, digital and content marketing to industry leading corporations, and consultative personal visits and solution designs. We research and publish thought provoking perspectives on key industry issues, and use forums, speaking engagements, articles and white papers, as well as our website and broad global digital and social media presence to establish our leadership position in the market.
 Our sales force is composed of business development managers who pursue new business opportunities and strategic account managers who manage and grow relationships with existing accounts. We emphasize account development to strengthen relationships with existing clients. Business development management and strategic account managers are assigned to markets in their area of expertise in order to develop a complete understanding of each client’s particular needs, to form strong client relationships and encourage cross-selling of our other service offerings. We have inside customer sales representatives who receive customer inquiries and who provide pre-sales relationship development for the business development managers. We employ modern methods of search and digital media to 
 8

cultivate interest in our brand and services. We use a methodical approach to collecting client feedback through quarterly business reviews, annual strategic reviews, and through our bi-annual Voice of the Client program, which enables us to react to early warning signs, and quickly identify and remedy challenges.  It also is used to highlight our most loyal clients, who we then work with to provide references, testimonials and joint speaking engagements at industry conferences.
 As part of our marketing efforts, we invite existing and potential clients to experience our customer experience management centers and at-home agent delivery operations, where we can demonstrate the expertise of our skilled staff in partnering to deliver new ways of growing clients’ revenues, customer satisfaction and retention rates, and thus profit, through timely, insightful and proven solutions. This forum allows us to demonstrate our capabilities to design, launch and scale programs. It also allows us to illustrate our best innovations in talent management, analytics, and digital channels, and how they can be best integrated into a program’s design. 
 Clients
 We provide service to clients from our locations in the United States, Canada, Latin America, Australia, the Asia Pacific Rim, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. These clients are Global 2000 corporations, medium-sized businesses and public institutions, which span the financial services, technology, communications, transportation & leisure, healthcare and other industries. Revenue by industry vertical for 2020, as a percentage of our consolidated revenues, was 33% for financial services, 23% for technology, 20% for communications, 7% for transportation & leisure, 6% for healthcare and 11% for all other verticals, including retail. We believe our globally recognized client base presents opportunities for further cross marketing of our services.
 See Note 25, Segments and Geographic Information, of the accompanying “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional client information.
 Competition 
 The industry in which we operate is global, highly fragmented and extremely competitive. While many companies provide customer experience management solutions and services, we believe no one company is dominant in the industry. 
 In most cases, our principal competition stems from our existing and potential clients’ in-house customer experience management operations. When it is not the in-house operations of a client or potential client, our public and private direct competition includes [24]7.ai, Alorica, Arise, Atento, Concentrix, Groupe Acticall/Sitel, iQor, LiveOps, StarTek, Sutherland, Teleperformance, Telus International, TTEC, Transcom and Working Solutions, as well as the customer care arm of such companies as Accenture, Conduent, Infosys, Tech Mahindra and Wipro, among others. In addition, we also compete with certain back-office BPO providers such as Genpact Limited, ExlService Holdings, Inc. and WNS (Holdings) Limited. There are other numerous and varied providers of such services, including firms specializing in various CRM consulting, other customer experience management solutions providers, niche or large market companies, as well as product distribution companies that provide fulfillment services. Some of these companies possess substantially greater resources, greater name recognition and a more established customer base than we do. 
 We believe that the most significant competitive factors in the sale of outsourced customer experience management services include service quality, tailored value-added service offerings, industry experience, advanced technological capabilities, global coverage, reliability, scalability, security, price and financial strength. As a result of intense competition, outsourced customer experience management solutions and services frequently are subject to pricing pressure. Clients also require outsourcers to be able to provide services in multiple locations. Competition for contracts for many of our services takes the form of competitive bidding in response to requests for proposal. 
 Intellectual Property
 The success of our business depends, in part, on our proprietary technology and intellectual property.  We rely on a combination of intellectual property laws and contractual arrangements to protect our intellectual property.  We and our subsidiaries have registered various trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and/or other countries, including SYKES®, SYKES HOME®, REAL PEOPLE. REAL SOLUTIONS.®, SCIENCE OF SERVICE®,

TALENTSPROUT®, CARE COACH®, CLEARLINK®, MOVEAROO®, BIGLOCAL®, YOU MOVE. WE JUMP.®, USDIRECT®, LEADAMP®, A SECURE LIFE®, RAINGAGE®, TRUE PROTECT®, TERMLIFE2GO®, SAFEWISE®, LET’S TALK®, LETSTALK.COM®,   PORTENT®, WHISTLEOUT®, LOVE YOUR PLAN®, THE PENNY HOARDER®, DEAR PENNY®, and GOURMET ON A DIME®.  The duration of trademark and service mark registrations varies from country to country, but may generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the marks are in use and their registrations are properly maintained.  We have an issued U.S. patent No. 10,748,099 that relates to foundational analytics enabling digital transformations, issued U.S. patent No. 10,742,649 that relates to systems and methods for secure authentication to computer networks and virtual work environment setup, a pending U.S. patent application that relates to systems and methods for analysis, testing, and recommendations for improving customer experience, and a pending U.S. patent application that relates to adaptive workspace environments.  Our subsidiary, Alpine, was issued U.S. Patent No. 8,565,413, which relates to a system and method for establishment and management of a remote agent experience management center. Alpine was also issued U.S. Patent No. 9,100,484, which relates to a secure call environment.
 Human Capital
 As of January 31, 2021, we had approximately 61,100 employees worldwide, primarily customer experience agents at our centers and at-home agents handling technical and customer support inquiries. Our employees, with the exception of certain employees in Brazil and various European countries, are not union members and we have never suffered a material interruption of business as a result of a labor dispute. We consider our relations with our employees worldwide to be satisfactory. 
 We employ personnel through a continually updated recruiting network. This network includes a seasoned team of recruiters, competency-based selection standards and the sharing of global best practices in order to advertise to and source qualified candidates through proven recruiting techniques. Nonetheless, demand for qualified professionals with the required language and technical skills may still exceed supply at times as new skills are needed to keep pace with the requirements of customer experience management. As such, competition for such personnel is intense.  Additionally, employee turnover in our industry is high.
 
We recognize that a diverse labor force with a mix of backgrounds, skills and experiences drives new ideas and innovations, providing us with a sustained competitive advantage. Through the following programs we aim to promote the personal and professional growth of our staff.
  
• | SYKES Women In Technology – This program promotes and facilitates the inclusion of women in technology accounts and empowers them to learn more about high-tech growth options within the organization.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Peer Mentoring – This program is designed to help leaders collaborate with others, to extend their network across the organization, and to be challenged to think outside the box.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leadership Evaluation and Advancement Program – The LEAP program aims to improve knowledge and equip employees with the necessary skills to develop talent and grow within the company. LEAP establishes candidates for internal promotions based on forecasted growth or new positions within accounts.
