Item 1. Business
General
Howard Bancorp, Inc., the parent company of Howard Bank, was incorporated in April 2005 under the laws of the State of Maryland to serve as the bank holding company of Howard Bank. Howard Bank is a Maryland-chartered trust company that was formed in March 2004 and commenced banking operations in August 2004. Howard Bank does not currently exercise trust powers, and our business, powers and regulatory structure are the same as a Maryland-chartered commercial bank. The Bank has nine subsidiaries—six were formed to hold foreclosed real estate (three of which are currently inactive), two own and manage real estate used for corporate purposes, and one holds historic tax credit investments.
In this report, unless the context suggests otherwise, references to the “Company” refer to Howard Bancorp, Inc. and references to “we,” “us,” and “our” mean the combined business of the Company and the Bank and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
Howard Bank is headquartered in Baltimore City, Maryland. We consider our primary market area to be the Greater Baltimore metropolitan area. We engage in a general commercial banking business, making various types of loans and accepting deposits. We market our financial services to small- and medium-sized businesses and their owners, professionals and executives, and high-net-worth individuals. Our loans are primarily funded by core deposits of customers in our market.
Our core business strategy involves driving organic growth by delivering advice and superior customer service to clients through local decision makers. Our customer focus is small- and medium-sized businesses in our local markets and we compete by providing our customers a broad array of products, new technology and access to seasoned banking professionals. Our experienced executives seek to establish a relationship with each client and bring value to all phases of a client’s business and personal banking needs. To develop this strategy, we have established long-standing relationships with key customers in the community and with local business leaders who can create business opportunities.
Our leadership team is deep and experienced both as it relates to tenure with us and to industry experience. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mary Ann Scully, founded the Company and has over 35 years of banking experience, mainly in senior executive roles with larger financial institutions. Our President and Chief Operating Officer, Robert D. Kunisch, Jr., has over 30 years of banking experience. In addition, we employ a strong stable of next level senior leadership, which we believe is critical for the successful implementation of our strategic initiatives. It is this leadership experience that has driven our growth since our founding.
Our strategic plan focuses on enhancing stockholder value through market share growth as reflected in balance sheet growth, related revenue growth and resulting growth in operating profits. During the past several years, we have expanded our branch locations both through opening new branches and acquiring branch offices via acquisition. More recently, we have focused on branch optimization initiatives that have resulted in a reduction in branches. While we may open additional branches in the counties where we now operate and in contiguous counties over the next several years, we currently have no definitive plans or agreements in place with respect to any additional branches. Our long-term vision also includes supplementing our organic growth with strategic acquisitions. As discussed below, we have completed and integrated multiple bank acquisitions and we consider additional acquisitions to be a critical component of furthering our future growth. We believe that acquiring other financial institutions, in whole or in part, through business line spin-offs, branch purchases or the hiring of teams of individuals, will allow us to expand our market, achieve certain operating efficiencies, and grow our stockholder base and thus our share value and liquidity. We believe that our demonstrated expertise in commercial lending and deposit gathering (especially non-interest bearing transactional deposits), our demonstrated ability to attract additional investment and capital, and community leadership, positions us as an attractive acquirer.

Our Market Area
Our headquarters are located in Baltimore City, Maryland. We consider our primary market area to be the Greater Baltimore Metropolitan Area in Maryland. As of December 31, 2020, we had 15 full-service branches and eight commercial lending offices located throughout Maryland; however, we plan to close two of our branches in early 2021. For additional details regarding branch and lending offices, see “Item 2. Properties” below in this report.
Competition
Our primary market area is highly competitive and heavily branched by other financial institutions of all sizes. The principal methods of competition for financial services are price (interest rates paid on deposits, interest rates charged on loans and fees charged for services) and service (convenience and quality of services rendered to customers). In addition to competition from other commercial banks, we face significant competition from non-bank financial institutions, including savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, insurance companies and investment firms. The financial services industry has become more competitive as technology advances have lowered barriers to entry, enabling more companies, including nonbank companies, to provide financial services. Many of our nonbank competitors which are not subject to the same extensive federal regulations that govern bank holding companies and banks, such as the Company and the Bank, may have certain competitive advantages. Technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial institutions. We also compete for deposits with a broad range of other types of investments, including mutual funds and annuities.
Mergers and acquisitions have also led to increased concentration in the banking industry, placing added competitive pressure on our core banking products and services as we see competitors enter some of our markets or offer similar products. While we believe that acquisitions of several local competitors by larger institutions headquartered outside of the State of Maryland during the last several years has enhanced our competitive position as a locally-headquartered and managed community bank, many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we do and offer services, such as extensive and established branch networks and trust services, that we do not expect to provide in the near future or ever.
As a community bank with over $2.5 billion in assets, we believe that we are well positioned to navigate the ongoing market consolidation and heightened regulatory environment. We have the ability to outsource certain activities (internal audit, compliance review, information security monitoring) and to source new products and services in a highly efficient manner, allowing us to avoid the risk of impairment of operating earnings faced by some banks. We believe this offers an advantage over our competitors which may be locked into legacy systems, or which may find the onslaught of new regulations and evolving consumer expectations challenging. Strategic partnerships for these outsourced activities include contractual relationships with some of the largest and strongest providers of item processing, data processing, information monitoring and payment systems alternatives. We believe that this provides us with the best of technology and product selection without sacrificing the more intimate delivery advantages of a community bank. We further believe the current economic and regulatory environment will continue to result in greater consolidation among financial institutions, including community banks. Some of that consolidation will occur with larger banks, thus exacerbating the scarcity of banks able to underwrite and offer advice in interactions with customers as we do, which we believe gives us a wider window of opportunity to extend our brand and value proposition. We believe, however, that to the extent some of that consolidation occurs between and among smaller banks, the resulting combined institutions will be better positioned to differentiate themselves. Areas of our primary market are currently experiencing significant disruption due to industry consolidation, management turnover and de novo banking activities. We believe these disruptions will continue in the short-term and may accelerate, which could create additional opportunities for us.
We believe that “Our Mission to Build our Legacy by Helping Others to Build Theirs” approach to delivering services to small and medium-sized businesses is essential to our competitive position. Through a team of experienced advisors, we provide our customers with access to local policy and decision makers. We also offer an array of competitive credit and cash management services that we feel fills a “white space” in the market. We believe that we fit well between sophisticated, but often distracted large banks and responsive, but less capable small banks. Our relationship managers, team leaders and executive management generally have decades of banking experiences and are well established in the communities that they serve. They are able to interface with clients directly to share that experience and to provide 

3



connections with their own network of other specialized advisors. We believe we also benefit from our committed leadership, at both the executive management and board level, who bring a broad array of skills and experiences and who are able to position us for consistent profitable growth.
Lending Activities
General
Our primary focus is making loans to and gathering deposits from small and medium-sized businesses and their owners, professionals and executives, and high-net-worth individuals in our primary market area. Our loans are made to customers primarily in the Greater Baltimore market and, to a lesser extent, the Greater Washington market. Our lending activities consist generally of short to medium-term commercial lending, commercial mortgage lending for both owner occupied and investment properties, residential mortgage lending, and consumer lending, both secured and unsecured. A substantial portion of our loan portfolio consists of loans to businesses secured by real estate and/or other business assets.
Credit Policies and Administration
We have adopted a comprehensive lending policy that includes stringent underwriting standards for all types of loans. Our lending teams follow pricing guidelines established periodically by our management team. In an effort to manage risk, minimal lending authority is given to individual loan officers. Most loan officers can approve loans up to $100,000 (with a select number of loan officers having the authority to $1,000,000). The Chief Credit Officer, the Chief Commercial Banking Officer, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer can approve loans up to $2,500,000, or any two together can approve loans up to $5,000,000. Loans above these amounts are reviewed by our Loan Committee. Under the leadership of our executive management team, we believe that we employ experienced lending officers, secure appropriate collateral, and carefully monitor the financial condition of our borrowers and the concentration of loans in our portfolio.
In addition to the normal repayment risks, all loans in the portfolio are subject to the state of the economy and the related effects on the borrower and/or the real estate market. Generally, longer-term loans have periodic interest rate adjustments and/or call provisions. Senior management monitors the loan portfolio closely to ensure that we minimize past due loans and that we swiftly deal with potential problem loans.
We also retain an outside, independent firm to annually perform a detailed review of our loan portfolio. We use the results of the firm’s report primarily to validate the risk ratings applied to loans in the portfolio and identify any systemic weaknesses in underwriting, documentation or management of the portfolio. Results of the annual review are presented to executive management, the Asset Quality Committee of the board of directors of the Bank and the full board of directors of the Bank and are available to and used by regulatory examiners when they review the Bank’s asset quality.
We also use an internal credit administration group that assists us in the underwriting and serves as an additional reviewer of underwriting. In addition, a separately-managed loan administration group oversees documentation, compliance and timeliness of collection activities. Our outsourced internal audit firm also reviews documentation, compliance and file management.
Commercial Lending
Our commercial lending consists of lines of credit, revolving credit facilities, accounts receivable and inventory financing, term loans, equipment loans, equipment leases, small business administration (“SBA”) loans, stand-by letters of credit and unsecured loans. We originate commercial loans for any business purpose, including the financing of leasehold improvements and equipment, the carrying of accounts receivable, general working capital, contract administration and acquisition activities. These loans typically have maturities of seven years or less. We have a diverse client base and we do not have a concentration of these types of loans in any specific industry segment. We generally secure commercial business loans with accounts receivable and inventory, equipment, indemnity deeds of trust and other collateral such as marketable securities, cash value of life insurance, and time deposits at the Bank. Commercial business loans have a higher degree of risk than residential mortgage loans because the availability of funds for repayment generally depends on 

4



the success of the business. To help manage this risk, we establish parameters/covenants at the inception of the loan to provide early warning systems before payment default. We normally seek to obtain appropriate collateral and personal guarantees from the borrower’s principal owners. We are able, given our business model, to proactively monitor the financial condition of the business.
Commercial Mortgage Lending
We finance commercial real estate for our clients, for both owner-occupied properties and non-owner occupied (investment) properties (including residential properties). We generally will finance owner occupied commercial real estate at a maximum loan-to-value of 85% and non-owner occupied at a maximum loan-to-value of 80%. Our underwriting policies and processes focus on the underlying credit of the owner for owner-occupied real estate and on the rental income stream (including rent terms and strength of tenants) for non-owner occupied real estate as well as an assessment of the underlying real estate. Risks inherent in managing a commercial real estate portfolio relate to vacancy rates/absorption rates for surrounding properties, sudden or gradual drops in property values as well as changes in the economic climate. We attempt to mitigate these risks by carefully underwriting loans of this type as well as by following appropriate loan-to-value standards. We are cash flow lenders and we generally do not rely solely on property valuations in reaching a lending decision. Personal guarantees are often required for commercial real estate loans as they are for other commercial loans. Most of our commercial real estate loans carry fixed interest rates and amortize over 20 to 25 years but have five to seven-year maturities. Properties securing our commercial real estate loans primarily include office buildings, office condominiums, distribution facilities and manufacturing plants. Substantially all of our commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located in our market area.
Commercial real estate loans generally carry higher interest rates and have shorter terms than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. Commercial real estate loans, however, entail significant additional risks as compared with residential mortgage lending, as they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, the payment of loans secured by income-producing properties typically depends on the successful operation of the property, as repayment of the loan generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the property to cover operating expenses and debt service. Changes in economic conditions that are not in the control of the borrower or lender could affect the value of the collateral for the loan or the future cash flow of the property. Additionally, any decline in real estate values may be more pronounced for commercial real estate than residential properties.
Construction Lending
Construction lending can cover funding for land acquisition, land development and/or construction of residential or commercial structures. Our construction loans generally bear a variable rate of interest and have terms of one to two years. Funds are advanced on a percentage-of-completion basis. These loans are generally repaid at the end of the development or construction phase, although loans for both residential and commercial construction will often convert into a permanent mortgage loan at the end of the term of the loan. Loan to value parameters range from 65% of the value of land to 75% for developed land, 80% for commercial or multifamily construction and 85% for residential construction. These loan-to-value ratios represent the upper limit of advance rates to remain in compliance with Bank policy. Typically, loan-to-value ratios should be somewhat lower than these upper limits, requiring the borrower to provide significant equity at the inception of the loan. Our underwriting looks not only at the value of the property but the expected cash flows to be generated by sale of the parcels or completed construction. We expect the borrower to demonstrate solid experience in this type of construction and personal guarantees are usually required.
Construction lending entails significant risks compared with residential mortgage lending. These risks involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers with funds advanced upon the security of the land or the project under construction. The value of the project is estimated prior to the completion of construction. Thus, it is more difficult to evaluate accurately the total loan funds required to complete a project and related loan to value ratios. If the estimate of construction or development cost proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance additional funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property. Moreover, if the estimated value of the completed project proves to be inaccurate, the borrower may hold a property with a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment. To mitigate these risks, in addition to the underwriting considerations noted above, we maintain an in-house 

5



construction monitoring unit that has oversight for the projects and we require both site visits and frequent reporting before funds are advanced.
Residential Mortgage Lending
Beginning in early 2020, we ceased originating first lien residential mortgage loans as a result of the exit of our mortgage banking activities. In order to manage loan run-off within the residential mortgage loan portfolio, we now purchase first lien residential mortgage loans, on a servicing released basis, from third-party originators. In addition to ensuring program eligibility and prudent underwriting from our delegated correspondents, we require that all loans meet the ability to repay rules established by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). Correspondents must demonstrate experience, facilities, selling standards, capital requirements, legal standing, licensing and insurance in order to participate.
We originate home equity loans and home equity lines of credit that are primarily secured by a second mortgage on owner occupied one-to-four family residences. Our home equity loans are originated at fixed interest rates and with terms of between five and 30 years for primary residences and between five and 15 years for secondary and rental properties, and are fully amortizing. Our home equity lines allow for the borrower to draw against the line for ten years, after which the line is refinanced into a 20-year fixed-rate loan. Home equity lines of credit carry a variable rate of interest and minimum monthly payments during the draw period, which are the greater of (i) $50.00 or (ii) depending on credit score, loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios, either the interest due or interest due plus 1% of the outstanding loan balance. Home equity loans and lines of credit are generally underwritten with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 85% (80% when appraised value is greater than $1 million) for a primary residence when combined with the principal balance of the existing mortgage loan. At the time we close a home equity loan or line of credit, we record a mortgage to perfect our security interest in the underlying collateral.
Home equity loans and lines of credit generally have greater risk than owner-occupied residential loans secured by first mortgages. When customers default on their loans we attempt to foreclose on the property. However, the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to repay the amount of the unpaid loan, and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from these customers. In addition, decreases in property values could adversely affect the value of properties used as collateral for the loans. These second lien loans represent a smaller portion of our portfolio than our first lien residential mortgage loans.
Our home equity loans and lines of credit provide some diversification in our client base. Although most of these loans are in our primary market area, we believe the diversity of the individual loans in the portfolio reduces our potential risk.
Consumer Lending
We offer various types of secured and unsecured consumer loans, including marine loans originated through brokers. Consumer loans may present greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans because many consumer loans are unsecured or are secured by depreciating assets. Repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance because of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation. Consumer loan collections also depend on the borrower’s continuing financial stability. If a borrower suffers personal financial difficulties, the loan may not be repaid. Also, various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount we can recover on such loans.
Loan Originations, Purchases, Sales, Participations and Servicing
All loans that we originate or purchase are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures, which incorporate standard underwriting guidelines. We originate both fixed and variable rate loans. Our loan origination activity may be adversely affected by a rising interest rate environment that typically results in decreased loan demand. With the exit of our mortgage banking activities, we now generally retain in our portfolio the majority of loans that we originate. In addition, we now purchase first lien residential mortgage loans, on a servicing released basis, from third-party originators. We do not retain the servicing rights on any loans sold.

6



We occasionally sell participations in commercial loans to correspondent banks if the amount of the loan exceeds our internal lending limits. In addition, we purchase loan participations from correspondent banks in our local market. Those loans are underwritten in-house with the same care as loans directly originated.
Loan Approval Procedures and Authority
Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our board of directors. The loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower’s ability to repay the loan, the viability of the loan, and the adequacy of the value of the collateral that will secure the loan, if applicable. To assess a business borrower’s ability to repay, we review and analyze, among other factors, current income, credit history including our prior experience with the borrower, cash flow, any secondary sources of repayment, other debt obligations in regards to the equity/net worth of the borrower and collateral available to us to secure the loan.
We generally require appraisals of all real property securing one- to four-family residential and commercial real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit. All appraisers are state-licensed or state-certified appraisers, and our practice is to have local appraisers approved by our board of directors annually.
Mortgage Banking
Although we exited our mortgage banking activities in early 2020 and still have recourse exposure on loans we previously originated and sold. In general, we may be required to repurchase a previously sold mortgage loan or indemnify the purchaser if there is non-compliance with defined loan origination or documentation standards, including fraud, negligence or material misstatement in the loan documents. In addition, we may have an obligation to repurchase a loan if the mortgagor has defaulted early in the loan term. The potential default repurchase period varies by purchaser but can be up to approximately 12 months after sale of the loan to the purchaser. The recourse period for fraud, material misstatement, breach of representations and warranties, noncompliance with law, or similar matters could be as long as the term of the loan. Mortgages subject to recourse are collateralized by single-family residential properties, follow purchaser guidelines, and carry private mortgage insurance, where applicable.
The exit of our mortgage banking activities is discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Investments and Funding
We utilize both our investment and borrowings portfolios to balance the liquidity needs that result from changes in loan and deposit balances. It is our goal to provide adequate funding in support of loan growth and ample contingent liquidity against unusual funding needs. A significant portion of our investment portfolio is generally kept in highly liquid securities, and a portion of the portfolio is used to generate additional positive earnings. Our primary source of funds is, and will continue to be, core deposits generated from our market area. Additional funding is provided by overnight unsecured master notes, customer repurchase agreements, Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (“FHLB”) advances, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Discount Window borrowings, subordinated debentures and other purchased funds. Other purchased funds may include certificates of deposit (“CDs”) over $100,000, federal funds purchased, and institutional or brokered deposits. Collateralized lines of credit and Fed Funds lines of credit are maintained with multiple correspondent banks in order to protect liquidity levels resulting from unexpected deposit withdrawals and natural-market credit demand.
Our investment policy is reviewed annually by our board of directors. Our board of directors has appointed the Board Asset Liability Committee (“Board ALCO”) to serve as the Investment Committee. The Board ALCO meets at regular intervals (not less than quarterly) and provides a report on the investment portfolio performance to our full board of directors. The investment officer is designated by the Chief Executive Officer and is responsible for the day-to-day management of liquidity and the investment portfolio in accordance with the policies approved by our board of directors. We actively monitor our investment portfolio and the majority of the portfolio is classified as “available for sale.” In general, under such a classification, we may sell investment instruments as management deems appropriate.

Other Banking Products
We offer our customers wire transfer services, automated teller machines (“ATMs”) at all of our branch locations, ATM and check cards, safe deposit boxes at selected branches, and credit cards through a third party processor. In addition, we offer our business customers merchant card services, overnight sweep services, ACH origination capabilities, ACH and check positive pay, remote deposit capture devices for those customers who have a high volume of checks to deposit, and through a third-party provider, an insured cash sweep product to provide expanded FDIC coverage beyond the standard $250,000 per depositor.
We also provide digital banking capabilities to our customers. Our Online and Mobile Banking capabilities allow both consumer and business customers to essentially do their banking from anywhere at any time. All customers can open accounts, check balances, view eStatements, pay bills, set real-time account alerts, manage cards, and deposit checks from their desktops, tablets, and/or mobile devices. In addition, our consumer customers have access to send and receive money via Zelle®, mobile payment options including Apple Pay®, Google Pay™ and Samsung Pay™ and can control their debit cards by allowing them to remotely manage, monitor, and proactively control their debit card activity.
Deposit Activities
Deposits are the major source of our funding. We offer a broad array of consumer and business deposit products that include demand, money market, savings, individual retirement accounts, and certificates of deposit. Utilizing key technology partnerships, we offer a competitive array of commercial cash management products that allow us to attract demand deposits. We believe that we pay competitive rates on our interest bearing deposits. As a relationship-oriented organization, we generally seek to obtain deposit relationships with our loan clients.
Employees
We have 235 full-time and eight part-time employees as of December 31, 2020. None of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit, and we believe that relations with our employees are good.
Lending Limits
The Bank’s legal lending limit for loans to one borrower was $41.1 million as of December 31, 2020, and we further monitor our exposure to one borrower through an internal policy “in-house” lending limit of $25.0 million as of December 31, 2020, which in-house limit can be exceeded on a limited basis. As part of our risk management strategy, we may participate a portion of larger loans to other financial institutions. This strategy allows us to maintain customer relationships yet observe both the legal and “in house” lending limits and manage credit exposure. However, this strategy may not always be available.
Available Information
The Company is a public company subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). We file electronically with the SEC our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). We make available on the investor relations page of our website at www.howardbank.com, free of charge, copies of these reports as soon as reasonably practicable after filing or furnishing them to the SEC. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
As a financial institution, we operate in a highly regulated environment. The regulatory framework under which we operate is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (the “FDIC’s”) Deposit Insurance Fund and not for the protection of our stockholders and creditors. The following is a general summary of the material aspects of certain statutes and regulations applicable to us. These summary descriptions are not complete, 

8



and you should refer to the full text of the statutes, regulations, and corresponding guidance for more information. These statutes and regulations are subject to change, and additional statutes, regulations, and corresponding guidance may be adopted. We are unable to predict these future changes or the effects, if any, that these changes could have on our business, revenues, and results of operations.
Recent Regulatory Developments
Regulatory developments implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the CARES Act and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, which enhanced and expanded certain provisions of the CARES Act, have had and will continue to have an impact on our operations.
The CARES Act and Initiatives Related to COVID-19 
On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, was signed into law. The CARES Act provided for approximately $2.2 trillion in direct economic relief in response to the public health and economic impacts of COVID-19. Many of the CARES Act’s programs are, and remain, dependent upon the direct involvement of financial institutions like the Bank. These programs have been implemented through rules and guidance adopted by federal departments and agencies, including the U.S. Department of Treasury, the Federal Reserve and other federal bank regulatory authorities, including those with direct supervisory jurisdiction over the Company and the Bank. Furthermore, as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, federal regulatory authorities continue to issue additional guidance with respect to the implementation, life cycle, and eligibility requirements for the various CARES Act programs, as well as industry-specific recovery procedures for COVID-19. In addition, it is possible that Congress will enact supplementary COVID-19 response legislation, including amendments to the CARES Act or new bills comparable in scope to the CARES Act. We continue to assess the impact of the CARES Act and other statutes, regulations and supervisory guidance related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
On March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, or ARP, was signed into law. The ARP provides for approximately $1.9 trillion in direct economic relief as well as funding for COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, and vaccine deployment. The ARP builds upon many of the measures from the CARES Act and subsequent COVID-19 related legislation.
Paycheck Protection Program
A principal provision of the CARES Act amended the SBA’s loan program to create a guaranteed, unsecured loan program, the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, to fund operational costs of eligible businesses, organizations and self-employed persons impacted by COVID-19. These loans are eligible to be forgiven if certain conditions are satisfied and are fully guaranteed by the SBA. Additionally, loan payments will also be deferred for the first six months of the loan term. The PPP commenced on April 3, 2020 and was available to qualified borrowers through August 8, 2020. No collateral or personal guarantees were required. On December 27, 2020, the President signed into law omnibus federal spending and economic stimulus legislation titled the “Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021” that included the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act (the “HHSB Act”). Among other things, the HHSB Act renewed the PPP, allocating $284.45 billion for both new first time PPP loans under the existing PPP and the expansion of existing PPP loans for certain qualified, existing PPP borrowers. In addition to extending and amending the PPP, the HHSB Act also creates a new grant program for “shuttered venue operators.” As a participating lender in the PPP, we continue to monitor legislative, regulatory, and supervisory developments related thereto, including the most recent changes implemented by the HHSB Act.
Troubled Debt Restructurings and Loan Modifications for Affected Borrowers
The CARES Act, as extended by certain provisions of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, permits banks to suspend requirements under GAAP for loan modifications to borrowers affected by COVID-19 that may otherwise be characterized as troubled debt restructurings and suspend any determination related thereto if (i) the borrower was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019, (ii) the modifications are related to COVID-19, and (iii) the modification occurs between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of 60 days after the date of termination of the national 

9



emergency or January 1, 2022. Federal bank regulatory authorities also issued guidance to encourage banks to make loan modifications for borrowers affected by COVID-19.
Howard Bancorp, Inc.
We are a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”). We are subject to regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (the “FRB”) and the Maryland Office of the Commissioner of Financial Regulation (the “Commissioner”) and are required to file periodic reports and any additional information that the FRB and the Commissioner may require. In addition, the FRB and the Commissioner have enforcement authority over the Company, which includes the power to remove officers and directors and the authority to issue cease and desist orders to prevent us from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices or violating laws or regulations governing our business. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with regulatory authorities.
The status of Howard Bancorp as a registered bank holding company under the BHC Act and a Maryland-chartered bank holding company does not exempt it from certain federal and state laws and regulations applicable to corporations generally, including, without limitation, certain provisions of the federal securities laws.
Source of Strength
Under FRB regulations, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. Under this requirement, we could, in the future, be required to provide financial assistance to the Bank should the Bank experience financial distress. In addition, in serving as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks, a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks. A bank holding company’s failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the FRB to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice, a violation of FRB regulations or both. The FRB may require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or relinquish control of a nonbank subsidiary (other than a nonbank subsidiary of a bank) upon the FRB’s determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness or stability of any subsidiary depository institution of the bank holding company. Further, federal bank regulatory authorities have additional discretion to require a bank holding company to divest itself of any bank or nonbank subsidiary if the agency determines that divestiture may aid the depository institution’s financial condition.
Acquisitions
The primary purpose of a bank holding company is to control and manage banks. The BHC Act generally requires the prior approval of the FRB for any merger involving a bank holding company or any acquisition by a bank holding company of another bank or bank holding company. Subject to certain conditions (including deposit concentration limits established by the BHC Act), the FRB may allow a bank holding company to acquire banks located in any state of the United States. In approving interstate acquisitions, the FRB is required to give effect to applicable state law limitations on the aggregate amount of deposits that may be held by the acquiring bank holding company and its FDIC-insured institution affiliates in the state in which the target bank is located (provided that those limits do not discriminate against out-of-state institutions or their holding companies) and state laws that require that the target bank have been in existence for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years) before being acquired by an out-of-state bank holding company. Furthermore, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), bank holding companies must be well-capitalized and examiners must rate them well-managed in order to effect interstate mergers or acquisitions.

Change in Control
Two statutes, the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act (the “CIBC Act”), together with regulations promulgated under them, require some form of regulatory review before any company may acquire “control” of a bank or a bank holding company. Under the BHC Act, control is deemed to exist if a company acquires 25% or more of any class of voting securities of a bank holding company; controls the election of a majority of the members of the board of directors; or exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of a bank or bank holding company. On January 30, 2020, the FRB issued a final rule (which became effective September 30, 2020) that clarified and codified the FRB’s standards for determining whether one company has control over another. The final rule established four categories of tiered presumptions of noncontrol that are based on the percentage of voting shares held by the investor (less than 5%, 5-9.9%, 10-14.9% and 15-24.9%) and the presence of other indicia of control. As the percentage of ownership increases, fewer indicia of control are permitted without falling outside of the presumption of noncontrol. These indicia of control include nonvoting equity ownership, director representation, management interlocks, business relationship and restrictive contractual covenants. Under the final rule, investors can hold up to 24.9% of the voting securities and up to 33% of the total equity of a company without necessarily having a controlling influence.
Under the CIBC Act, an investor that owns or controls 10% or more of any class of voting stock of a bank or bank holding company and (i) the institution has registered securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act and (ii) no other person owns, controls or has the power to vote a greater percentage of that class of voting securities is considered a “control” person and may be required to file a change in control notice with the primary federal regulator of the bank or with the FRB. For the purposes of both the BHC Act and the CIBC Act, ownership by affiliated parties, or parties acting in concert, is typically aggregated.
Activities
Pursuant to provisions of the BHC Act and regulations promulgated by the FRB thereunder, the Company may only engage in or own companies that engage in activities deemed by the FRB to be so closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto, and the holding company must obtain permission from the FRB prior to engaging in most new business activities. As a bank holding company, we also can elect to be treated as a “financial holding company,” which would allow us to engage in a broader array of activities. In sum, a financial holding company can engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to financial activities, including insurance underwriting, sales and brokerage activities, providing financial and investment advisory services and underwriting services, and engaging in limited merchant banking activities. We have not sought financial holding company status, but we may elect that status in the future as our business matures. If we were to elect in writing for financial holding company status, we would be required to be well capitalized and well managed, and each insured depository institution we control would also have to be well capitalized, well managed and have at least a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act (discussed below).
Capital Requirements
The FRB imposes certain capital requirements on a bank holding company under the BHC Act, including a minimum leverage ratio and a minimum ratio of “qualifying” capital to risk-weighted assets. These requirements are essentially the same as those that apply to the Bank and are described below under “Howard Bank—Capital Requirements.” However, because the Company currently has less than $3.0 billion in consolidated assets, it currently qualifies as a small bank holding company, and these capital requirements do not currently apply to the Company. Subject to certain restrictions, we are able to borrow money to make a capital contribution to the Bank, and these loans may be repaid from dividends paid from the Bank to the Company.
Dividends
The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The FRB has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies. In general, the FRB’s policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. Under the prompt corrective 

11



action rules discussed below, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions.
In addition, funds for cash distributions to our stockholders are derived primarily from dividends received from our Bank. Our Bank is subject to various general regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends. Any restriction on the ability of our Bank to pay dividends will indirectly restrict the ability of the Company to pay dividends to our stockholders. See “Howard Bank—Dividends” below.
Federal Securities Regulation
Our common stock is registered with the SEC under the Exchange Act. As such, we are subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements of the Exchange Act.
Further, if we wish to sell common stock or other securities to raise capital in the future, we will be subject to the registration, anti-fraud, and other applicable provisions of state and federal securities laws. For example, we will have to register the sales of such securities under the Securities Act, the Maryland Securities Act, and the applicable securities laws of each state in which we offer or sell the securities, unless an applicable exemption from registration exists with respect to such sales. Such exemptions may, among other things, limit the number and types of persons we could sell such securities to and the manner in which we could market the securities. We would also be subject to federal and state anti-fraud requirements with respect to any statements we make to potential purchasers in connection with the offer and sale of such securities.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
The Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. We have adopted policies, procedures and systems designed to ensure compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act and related regulations.
Howard Bank
Howard Bank is a Maryland-chartered trust company (with all powers of a commercial bank), and its deposit accounts are insured by the FDIC up to the maximum legal limits. It is subject to regulation, supervision and regular examination by the Commissioner and the FDIC. The regulations of these agencies govern most aspects of the Bank’s business, including required reserves against deposits, loans, investments, mergers and acquisitions, borrowing, dividends and location and number of branch offices.
Financial Institutions Article of the Maryland Annotated Code
The Financial Institutions Article of the Maryland Annotated Code (the “Banking Code”) contains detailed provisions governing the organization, operations, corporate powers, commercial and investment authority, branching rights and responsibilities of directors, officers and employees of Maryland banking institutions. The Banking Code delegates extensive rulemaking power and administrative discretion to the Commissioner in its supervision and regulation of state-chartered banking institutions. The Commissioner may order any banking institution to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice.
The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act
On May 24, 2018, President Trump signed into law the first major financial services reform bill since the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act.  The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the “Reform Law”) modifies 

12



or eliminates certain requirements on community and regional banks and nonbank financial institutions.  For instance, under the Reform Act and related rule making:
● banks that have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and total trading assets and trading liabilities of less than five percent of total consolidated assets are exempt from Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, known as the “Volcker Rule”, which prohibits “proprietary trading” and the ownership or sponsorship of private equity or hedge funds that are referred to as “covered funds”;
● the asset threshold for bank holding companies to qualify for treatment under the “Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement” was raised from $1 billion to $3 billion, which exempts these institutions (including the Company) from certain regulatory requirements including the Basel III capital rules;
● a new “community bank leverage ratio” was adopted, which is applicable to certain banks and bank holding companies with total assets of less than $10 billion (as described below under “Capital Requirements”); and
● banks with up to $3 billion in total consolidated assets may be examined by their federal banking regulator every 18 months (as opposed to every 12 months).
Capital Requirements
Regulatory capital rules adopted in July 2013 and fully phased in as of January 1, 2019, which we refer to as Basel III, impose minimum capital requirements for bank holding companies and banks. The Basel III rules apply to all national and state banks and savings and loan associations regardless of size and bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies other than “small bank holding companies,” generally holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $3 billion. The Company is currently considered a “small bank holding company.” More stringent requirements are imposed on “advanced approaches” banking organizations-those organizations with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets, $10 billion or more in total foreign exposures, or that have opted into the Basel II capital regime. Specifically, the following minimum capital requirements apply to the Bank:
● a common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%;
● a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%;
● a total risk-based capital ratio of 8%; and
● a leverage ratio of 4%.
The final rules also established a “capital conservation buffer” above the regulatory minimum capital requirements, which must consist entirely of CET1 risk-based capital, which was phased in over several years. The fully phased-in capital conservation buffer of 2.500%, which became effective on January 1, 2019, resulted in the following effective minimum capital ratios beginning in 2019: (i) a CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%. Under Basel III, institutions are subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if their capital levels fall below the buffer amount. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.
Under Basel III, Tier 1 capital includes two components: CET1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. The highest form of capital, CET1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, otherwise referred to as AOCI, and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock. Additional Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, Tier 1 minority interests and grandfathered trust preferred securities (as discussed below). Tier 2 capital generally includes the allowance for loan and lease losses up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, qualifying preferred stock, subordinated debt and qualifying tier 2 minority interests, less any deductions in Tier 2 instruments of an unconsolidated financial institution. Cumulative perpetual preferred stock is included only in Tier 2 capital, except that the Basel III rules permit bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in total consolidated assets to continue to include trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued before May 19, 2010 in Tier 1 Capital (but not in CET1 capital), subject to certain restrictions. The regulations also require unrealized gains and losses on certain “available-for-sale” securities holdings to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital unless the Bank elected to opt-out from this treatment, which it did.

13



On December 21, 2018, the federal banking agencies issued a joint final rule to revise their regulatory capital rules to (i) address the upcoming implementation of a new credit impairment model, the Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL model, an accounting standard under GAAP; (ii) provide an optional three-year phase-in period for the day-one adverse regulatory capital effects that banking organizations are expected to experience upon adopting CECL; and (iii) require the use of CECL in stress tests beginning with the 2020 capital planning and stress testing cycle for certain banking organizations that are subject to stress testing. We are currently evaluating the impact the CECL model will have on our accounting, and expect to recognize a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to our allowance for loan and lease losses as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2023, the first reporting period in which the new standard is effective for us. At this time, we cannot yet reasonably determine the magnitude of such one-time cumulative adjustment, if any, or of the overall impact of the new standard on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
In November 2019, the federal banking regulators published final rules implementing a simplified measure of capital adequacy for certain banking organizations that have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets. Under the final rules, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, depository institutions and depository institution holding companies that have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and meet other qualifying criteria, including a leverage ratio of greater than 9%, off-balance-sheet exposures of 25% or less of total consolidated assets and trading assets plus trading liabilities of 5% or less of total consolidated assets, are deemed “qualifying community banking organizations” and are eligible to opt into the “community bank leverage ratio framework.” A qualifying community banking organization that elects to use the community bank leverage ratio framework and that maintains a leverage ratio of greater than 9% is considered to have satisfied the generally applicable risk-based and leverage capital requirements under the Basel III rules and, if applicable, is considered to have met the “well capitalized” ratio requirements for purposes of its primary federal regulator’s prompt corrective action rules, discussed below. The final rules include a two-quarter grace period during which a qualifying community banking organization that temporarily fails to meet any of the qualifying criteria, including the greater-than-9% leverage capital ratio requirement, is generally still deemed “well capitalized” so long as the banking organization maintains a leverage capital ratio greater than 8%. A banking organization that fails to maintain a leverage capital ratio greater than 8% is not permitted to use the grace period and must comply with the generally applicable requirements under the Basel III rules and file the appropriate regulatory reports. We do not have any immediate plans to elect to use the community bank leverage ratio framework but may make such an election in the future.
Prompt Corrective Action
Under federal prompt corrective action regulations, the bank regulatory agencies are authorized and, under certain circumstances, required, to take various “prompt corrective actions” to resolve the problems of any bank subject to their jurisdiction that is not adequately capitalized. Depending on their capital levels, every insured depository institution is in one of five capital tiers: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. Under the prompt corrective action regulations, a bank is considered “well capitalized” if it: (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater; (iii) a CET1 ratio of 6.5% or greater; (iv) a leverage capital ratio of 5.0% or greater; and (iv) is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. Well capitalized status is a prerequisite for certain types of favorable regulatory treatment, including expedited processing of applications by the FDIC and the ability to rely on brokered deposits.
The Bank has been “well capitalized” since it commenced its business operations.
Effective with the March 31, 2020 Call Report, qualifying community banking organizations that elect to use the new community bank leverage ratio framework and that maintain a leverage ratio of greater than 9.0% will be considered to have satisfied the risk-based and leverage capital requirements to be deemed well-capitalized. We do not have any immediate plans to elect to use the community bank leverage ratio framework but may make such an election in the future.
The bank regulatory agencies may impose higher capital requirements on certain banks, and future regulatory change could impose higher capital standards as a routine matter. The regulators may also set higher capital requirements for holding companies whose circumstances warrant it. For example, holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets.

14



As an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain non-capital safety and soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator. The standards relate generally to operations and management, asset quality, interest rate exposure and executive compensation. The agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards.
Dividends
The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. Virtually all of the Company’s revenue available for the payment of dividends on its common stock results from dividends paid to the Company by the Bank. Under Maryland law, the Bank may declare a cash dividend, after providing for due or accrued expenses, losses, interest and taxes, from its undivided profits or, with the prior approval of the Commissioner, from its surplus in excess of 100% of its required capital stock. Also, if the Bank’s surplus is less than 100% of its required capital stock, then, until its surplus is 100% of its capital stock, the Bank must transfer to its surplus annually at least 10% of its net earnings and may not declare or pay any cash dividends that exceed 90% of its net earnings. In addition, federal bank regulators have stated that paying dividends that deplete a banking organization’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that banking organizations should generally only pay dividends out of current earnings. The Bank must also maintain the CET1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% to avoid becoming subject to restrictions on capital distributions, including dividends, as described above.
Deposit Insurance Assessments
The Bank’s deposit accounts are insured by the FDIC generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor. FDIC-insured depository institutions are required to pay deposit insurance assessments to the FDIC. The amount of a particular institution’s deposit insurance assessment is determined by an FDIC risk-based assessment system. The assessment is a function of a financial ratios method that takes into account seven financial ratios and the institution’s weighted average CAMELS component ratings. The assessment must be within a range that depends on the institution’s composite CAMELS rating, and the assessment will be adjusted up or down to come within the range. Assessment rates (inclusive of possible adjustments) for institutions with less than $10 billion in consolidated assets currently range from 1.5 to 30 basis points of each institution’s total assets less tangible capital. The FDIC may increase or decrease the range of assessments uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base assessment rate without notice and comment rulemaking. The FDIC may terminate insurance of deposits upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.
In addition to the ordinary assessments described above, the FDIC has the ability to impose special assessments in certain instances. For example, under the Dodd-Frank Act, the minimum designated reserve ratio for the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) was increased to 1.35% of the estimated total amount of insured deposits. On September 30, 2018, the DIF reached 1.36%, exceeding the statutorily required minimum reserve ratio of 1.35%. On reaching the minimum reserve ratio of 1.35%, FDIC regulations provided for two changes to deposit insurance assessments: (i) surcharges on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more (large institutions) ceased; and (ii) small banks were to receive assessment credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed to the growth in the reserve ratio from between 1.15% and 1.35%, to be applied when the reserve ratio is at or above 1.38%. The Bank subsequently received such assessment credits in 2019.
Maryland Regulatory Assessment
The Commissioner annually assesses state banking institutions to cover the expense of regulating banking institutions. The Bank’s asset size determines the amount of the assessment.
Liquidity
The Bank is subject to the uniform reserve requirements of the FRB’s Regulation D, which applies to all insured depository institutions with transaction accounts or non-personal time deposits. Effective March 26, 2020, the FRB reduced reserve 

15



requirement ratios to zero percent, thus eliminating reserve requirements for depository institutions to support lending to households and businesses. The FRB may change its reserve requirements in the future and the Bank may be subject to new reserve requirements for 2021.
Loans-to-One-Borrower Limitation
With certain limited exceptions, a Maryland banking institution may lend to a single or related group of borrowers an aggregate amount not more than 15% of its unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be lent, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if such loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which is defined to include certain securities and bullion, but generally does not include real estate. The Bank is in compliance with the loans-to-one borrower limitations.
Commercial Real Estate Loans
Commercial real estate (“CRE”) loans are subject to two types of regulatory oversight. If total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent more than 100% of a bank’s total capital or if total CRE loans represent 300% or more of total capital and have grown by 50% or more in the last 36 months, the bank is expected to have enhanced risk management and will be subject to greater regulatory scrutiny. In addition, the risk-based capital rules (so long as they are applicable) presumptively risk weight CRE loans at 100% but impose a 150% risk weight on loans deemed to be high volatility. Among other things, the capital rules required that a borrower contribute 15% of the equity of a financed project in order for the loan to qualify for the lower risk weight. The Reform Act narrowed the types of loans potentially subject to the higher risk weight but did not eliminate that risk weight.
Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws
Under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”), the FDIC is required to assess the record of all financial institutions regulated by it to determine if such institutions are meeting the credit needs of the communities (including low and moderate income neighborhoods) that they serve. CRA performance evaluations are based on a four-tiered rating system: Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve and Substantial Noncompliance. CRA performance evaluations are considered in evaluating applications for such things as mergers, acquisitions and new branches. The Bank has a CRA rating of “Satisfactory.”
In December 2019, the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) proposed changes to the regulations implementing the CRA. The FRB did not join the proposal. On May 20, 2020, the OCC issued a final rule to strengthen and modernize its existing CRA framework, but the FDIC was not prepared to finalize its CRA proposal at that time.
In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics, such as ethnicity, gender, and race, as specified in each statute. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the FDIC, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Department of Justice, and in private civil actions by borrowers.
Transactions with Related Parties
Transactions between banks and their related parties or affiliates are limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. In a holding company context, the parent bank holding company and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the bank.
Generally, Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act and the FRB’s Regulation W limit the “covered transactions” in which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of such bank’s capital stock and surplus, and limit such covered transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such bank’s capital stock and surplus. The term ‘‘covered transaction’’ includes loans, asset purchases, issuances of guarantees, and other similar 

16



transactions that expose the bank to the credit risk of an affiliate. In addition, loans or other extensions of credit by the bank to an affiliate must be collateralized in accordance with regulatory requirements. The Bank’s transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices and may not involve the purchase by the Bank of any low-quality asset. Section 23B applies to covered transactions as well as certain other transactions and requires that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the bank or subsidiary as those provided to non-affiliates.
Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and the FRB’s Regulation O govern extensions of credit made by a bank to its directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders (‘‘insiders’’). Among other things, these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Further, such extensions may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of Howard Bank’s capital. Extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must also be approved by the board of directors.
On December 22, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interagency statement extending the temporary relief from enforcement action against banks or asset managers, which become principal stockholders of banks, with respect to certain extensions of credit by banks that otherwise would violate Regulation O, provided the asset managers and banks satisfy certain conditions designed to ensure that there is a lack of control by the asset manager over the bank. This temporary relief will apply until January 1, 2022, unless amended or extended, while the FRB, in consultation with the other federal banking agencies, considers whether to amend Regulation O.
Standards for Safety and Soundness
Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation, and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard.
Enforcement Powers
The Bank and its “institution-affiliated parties,” including its management, employees, agents, independent contractors, and consultants such as attorneys and accountants and others who participate in the conduct of the financial institution’s affairs, are subject to potential civil and criminal penalties for violations of law, regulations or written orders of a government agency. These practices can include the failure of an institution to timely file required reports or the filing of false or misleading information or the submission of inaccurate reports. Potential civil penalties have been substantially increased. Criminal penalties for some financial institution crimes have been increased to 20 years.
In addition, regulators are provided with considerable flexibility to commence enforcement actions against institutions and institution-affiliated parties. Possible enforcement actions include the termination of deposit insurance. Furthermore, banking agencies’ have expansive power to issue cease-and-desist orders. These orders may, among other things, require affirmative action to correct any harm resulting from a violation or practice, including restitution, reimbursement, indemnifications or guarantees against loss. A financial institution may also be ordered to restrict its growth, dispose of certain assets, rescind agreements or contracts or take other actions as determined by the ordering agency to be appropriate.
Further, state attorneys general may bring civil actions or other proceedings under the Dodd-Frank Act or regulations against state-chartered banks, including the Bank.

Anti-Money Laundering and Office of Foreign Assets Control
Under federal law, financial institutions must maintain programs to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism that include established internal policies, procedures and controls; a designated compliance officer; an ongoing employee training program; testing of the program by an independent audit function; and a “know your customer” program with enhanced due diligence of certain customers. Financial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering; they must file currency transaction reports for deposits and withdrawals of large amounts of currency and suspicious activity reports of possible criminal activity. Financial institutions also must assess their money laundering risk with respect to private banking and foreign correspondent banking relationships. Law enforcement authorities have been granted increased access to financial information maintained by financial institutions. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations, and they must consider an institution’s compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications, including applications for banking mergers and acquisitions. The regulatory authorities have imposed “cease and desist” orders and civil money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be violating these obligations.
Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering compliance has been a special focus of the Federal banking agencies in recent years. Any non-compliance is likely to result in an enforcement action, often with substantial monetary penalties and reputation damage. A savings association or bank that is required to strengthen its compliance program often must put on hold any initiatives that require banking agency approval.
The Office of Foreign Assets Control, (“OFAC”) is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC sends bank regulatory agencies lists of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. If we find a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, we must freeze such account, file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities.
USA PATRIOT Act
The Patriot Act became effective on October 26, 2001 and amended the Bank Secrecy Act. The Patriot Act provides, in part, for the facilitation of information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering by enhancing anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws, as well as enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanics for the U.S. government, including:
● requiring standards for verifying customer identification at account opening;
● rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering;
● reports by nonfinancial trades and businesses filed with the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network for transactions exceeding $10,000; and
● filing suspicious activities reports by brokers and dealers if they believe a customer may be violating U.S. laws and regulations.
The Patriot Act requires financial institutions to undertake enhanced due diligence of private bank accounts or correspondent accounts for non-U.S. persons that they administer, maintain, or manage. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and are required to consider compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications.
Under the Patriot Act, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) can send the Bank a list of the names of persons suspected of involvement in terrorist activities or money laundering. The Bank may be requested to search its records for any relationships or transactions with persons on the list. If the Bank finds any relationships or transactions, it must report those relationships or transactions to FinCEN.

Consumer Protection Laws
We are subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and various state law counterparts. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, which has the responsibility for making rules and regulations under the federal consumer protection laws relating to financial products and services. The CFPB has the authority to supervise and examine depository institutions with more than $10 billion in assets for compliance with federal consumer laws. The authority to supervise and examine depository institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, such as the Bank, for compliance with federal consumer laws remains largely with those institutions’ primary regulators. However, the CFPB may participate in examinations of these smaller institutions on a “sampling basis” and may refer potential enforcement actions against such institutions to their primary regulators. As such, the CFPB may participate in examinations of the Bank. The CFPB also has a broad mandate to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices and is specifically empowered to require certain disclosures to consumers and draft model disclosure forms. Failure to comply with consumer protection laws and regulations can subject financial institutions to enforcement actions, fines and other penalties.
In addition, federal law currently contains extensive customer privacy protection provisions. Under these provisions, a financial institution must provide to its customers, at the inception of the customer relationship and annually thereafter, the institution’s policies and practices regarding the handling of customers’ nonpublic personal financial information. These provisions also provide that, except for certain limited exceptions, a financial institution may not provide such personal information to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution discloses to the customer that such information may be so provided and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure. Further, under the ‘‘Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security Standards,’’ banks must implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information. Federal law makes it a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means.
Effect of Governmental Monetary Policies
Our earnings are affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. The FRB’s monetary policies have had, and are likely to continue to have, an important impact on the operating results of commercial banks through the FRB’s power to implement national monetary policy in order, among other things, to curb inflation or combat a recession. The monetary policies of the FRB affect the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits through the FRB’s control over the issuance of United States government securities, its regulation of the discount rate applicable to member banks and its influence over reserve requirements to which member banks are subject. We cannot predict the nature or impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies.
