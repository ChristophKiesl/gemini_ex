Significant Contracts
 
Some of our significant contracts are as follows:
 
Military Aircraft – Subcontracts with Prime Contractors
 
NGC E-2D “Advanced Hawkeye”: The NGC E-2 Hawkeye is an all-weather, carrier-based tactical Airborne Early Warning aircraft. The twin turboprop aircraft was designed and developed in the 1950s by the Grumman Aircraft Company for the United States Navy. The United States Navy aircraft has been progressively updated with the latest variant, the E-2D, first flying in 2007. In 2008, we received an initial $7.9 million order from NGC to provide structural kits used in the production of Outer Wing Panels (“OWP”) of the E-2D. We initially valued the long-term agreement at approximately $98 million over an eight-year period, with the potential to be in excess of $195 million over the life of the aircraft program. In February of 2019, we announced a new multi-year award valued at up to approximately $47.5 million. In June 2020, we announced that we had received firm orders valued in excess of $43 million and $5 million in long-lead funding in anticipation of purchase orders for OWP structural components and kits. Since 2008, the cumulative orders we have received on this program through December 31, 2020 exceed $207 million.
 
In addition, in 2015 we won an award to supply structural components and kits for the Wet Outer Wing Panel (“WOWP”) on the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye airborne early warning and control (“AEW&C”) aircraft that will be manufactured for Japan. We are responsible for component source selection, supply chain management, delivery of kits, and are providing manufacturing engineering services to NGC during the integration of the components into the WOWP. In late 2019, CPI Aero received additional WOWP kit requirements increasing the total expected value of the WOWP program for Japan to be in excess of $37 million.
 
In February 2020, the Company’s WMI subsidiary received from NGC approximately $4 million in purchase orders to provide numerous welded structure and tubes for the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye. Under the terms of the purchase orders, WMI will manufacture more than 140 different items in support of the production of at least 25 E-2D aircraft. The period of performance is expected to be through 2022.
 
ALQ-249 Next Generation Jammer – Mid-Band Pod (NGJ-MB): The Raytheon NGJ-MB pod is an external jamming pod that will disrupt and degrade enemy aircraft and ground radar and communication systems and will replace the ALQ-99 system on the U.S. Navy's EA-6B Growler carrier-based electronic warfare aircraft. The U.S. Navy plans to install these pods on 138 EA-18G Growlers during the production phase. There are two pods per aircraft. Raytheon received a $1 billion sole source contract from the U.S. Navy in April 2016, and CPI Aero has a contract with Raytheon to assemble the pod structural housing and air management system (“AMS”). In 2019, Raytheon authorized CPI Aero to begin production of pod structures and air management system components for the System Demonstration and Test Article (“SDTA”) phase of the NGJ-MB program. All SDTA pods and AMS components are expected to ship during 2021. CPI Aero estimates the value of the NGJ-MB program through the SDTA phase to be approximately $60 million. On November 16, 2021 the Company announced it was authorized by Raytheon to start the production phase of the program. We believe that the total value of the NGJ-MB program through production will be in excess of $210 million through 2030.
A-10 Thunderbolt II “Warthog”: The Boeing A-10 Thunderbolt II, also known as the Warthog, is a twin-engine aircraft that provides close-air support of ground forces and employs a wide variety of conventional munitions including general-purpose bombs. The simple, effective and survivable single-seat aircraft can be used against all ground targets, including tanks and other armored vehicles. On August 21, 2019, Boeing announced an award from the USAF with a maximum contract value of $999 million to manage the production of up to 112 new wing sets and spares kits for A-10 aircraft. The USAF ordered 27 wing sets immediately at contract award. In 2019, CPI Aero announced the receipt of an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a maximum ceiling value of $48 million from Boeing for structural assemblies for the A-10. Under the terms of the IDIQ contract, CPI Aero will manufacture major structural subassemblies of the A-10 aircraft’s wing. The Company also announced that it has received initial purchase orders under the IDIQ contract valued at approximately $6 million for the production of four shipsets of assemblies and associated program start-up costs. In May 2020, CPI Aero announced the receipt of additional purchase orders totaling approximately $14 million from Boeing.
 
F-35 Lightning II: The Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II is a family of single-seat, single-engine, all-weather stealth multirole fighters designed to perform ground attack, aerial reconnaissance, and air defense missions. The DOD plans to acquire over 2,400 F-35's by 2034 and 11 other countries also have plans to acquire the aircraft. The Company has two significant contracts for products used on the F-35. In 2015, CPI Aero was awarded a multi-year contract to supply four different lock assemblies for the arresting gear door on the F-35A CTOL. CPI Aero made its first delivery under that contract in May 2017. In 2018, the Company received a new long-term agreement value at approximately $8 million for lock assemblies to be delivered between 2020 and 2024. In November 2017, CPI Aero was awarded an additional $15.8 million multi-year contract to manufacture canopy activation drive shaft assemblies for the F-35A, F-35B, and F-35C aircraft.

UH-60 “BLACK HAWK”: The Sikorsky UH-60 BLACK HAWK helicopter is the leader in multi-mission-type-aircraft. Among the mission configurations its serves are troop transport, medical evacuation, electronic warfare, attack, assault support and special operations. More than 3,000 BLACK HAWK helicopters are in use today, operating in 29 countries. CPI Aero and its WMI subsidiary manufacture several different structural assemblies, including welded structure, for the BLACK HAWK helicopter. The majority of CPI Aero’s contracts for the BLACK HAWK are as a Tier 1 supplier to Sikorsky. The Company also is a Tier 2 supplier to GKN Aerospace for ultimate use on the BLACK HAWK. In 2017, CPI Aero received an approximate $21 million long-term agreement through 2022 for the production of fuel panel assemblies, work it has performed for Sikorsky since 2010. Also in 2017, the Company received an $8 million long-term agreement through 2022 to manufacture machine gunner window assemblies, continuing work it has performed since 2010. More recently, since October 2018, CPI Aero has received multiple purchase orders totaling $22 million for Hover Infrared Suppression System (HIRSS) module assemblies for use as spares on older variants of the UH-60 BLACK HAWK helicopter. The HIRSS is a defensive countermeasures system that is integral to the survival of the UH-60 Black Hawk by reducing the opportunity for an infrared-seeking threat system to acquire, lock onto, track, and destroy the helicopter. In May 2021, the Company announced receiving a multi-year contract valued at up to $17.2 million for the overhaul and repair (O&R) of outboard stabilator assemblies in support of the Sikorsky MH-60 SEAHAWK.
 
F-16V Fighting Falcon: The Lockheed Martin F-16 is the world’s most successful, combat-proven multirole fighter. Approximately 3,000 operational F-16s are in service today in 25 countries. The F-16V is a new variant, sold exclusively to international air forces and is the most technologically advanced, fourth generation fighter in the world. In 2019, the Company announced it had been awarded a multi-year contract by Lockheed Martin to manufacture Rudder Island and Drag Chute Canister (RI/DCC) assemblies for the F-16V. The RI/DCC is a large structural sub-assembly that is installed on the tail section of the aircraft. Deliveries are expected to begin during late 2020 and continue through 2024. In June 2020, the Company announced that it had been awarded a follow-on order from Lockheed Martin to manufacture structural assemblies for new production F-16 Block 70/72 aircraft. The total value of the RI/DCC program is approximately $21 million and we have received more than $8.7 million in orders through December 31, 2020.
CH-53K King Stallion: The CH-53K is a heavy-lift helicopter being developed by Sikorsky for the United States Marine Corps. Flight testing began in 2018. We manufacture composite electronics racks as a Tier 2 supplier to Spirit AeroSystems, Inc., the manufacturer of the CH-53K cockpit and cabin. Through December 31, 2020, we have received orders for development and test valued at more than $2.5 million, including a $1.1 million order for rack with delivery requirements commencing in mid-2020 through 2021.
Undisclosed Vehicle: In 2018 the Company received an initial purchase order from Raytheon Missile Systems Company, a subsidiary of Raytheon, to manufacture structural assemblies on an undisclosed vehicle. In 2019, CPI Aero completed the initial order and in January 2021, CPI Aero announced a subsequent purchase order to manufacture additional units. The undisclosed vehicle is currently under development. Terms of the order will not be disclosed.
Undisclosed Pod Structure: In 2019, the Company received an initial purchase order from Raytheon to manufacture pod structures for an undisclosed application. The value of the order was approximately $2.3 million for manufacturing engineering service, development of assembly tooling and the production of the prototypes. The undisclosed pod structure is currently under development. In October 2021, the Company announced Raytheon awarded an approximate $6 million contract modification that changes the scope of work the Company would perform and increases the quantity of pods to be produced. .
Military Aircraft – Prime Contracts with U.S. Government
 
F-16 “Fighting Falcon”: Since 2014, we have been a prime contractor to the DLA to provide structural wing components and logistical support for global F-16 aircraft MRO operations. Through December 31, 2020 we have received almost $15 million in orders on this program.
T-38 Pacer Classic III, Phase 2: For more than 50 years, the Northrop T-38 has been the principal supersonic jet trainer used by the USAF. The T-38C Pacer Classic III Fuselage Structural Modification Kit Integration program (“PC III”) and the Talon Repair Inspection and Maintenance (“TRIM”) programs are expected to increase the structural service life of the T-38 beyond 2030. In 2015, CPI Aero was awarded Phase 2 of PC III and has received purchase orders valued at approximately $2 million from the USAF to provide structural modification kits for the PC III aircraft structural modification program. Through December 2020, we have received $23.8 million in orders on this program.
 
8


T-38 Pacer Classic III, Phase 3 and TRIM: In July 2019, the Company announced a new $65.7 million IDIQ contract from the USAF for the final phase of PC III as well as TRIM. The TRIM program is a separate USAF structural modification effort that will extend the structural service life of T-38A and T-38 model types, as well as, T-38C models that were not modified during PC III. Through December 31 2020, the Company has received orders valued at approximately $15.3 million for the PC III, Phase 3 and TRIM programs. In 2021, the Company announced it had received three separate orders for additional requirements valued at $16.2 million, bringing total orders under this long term contract to approximately $31.5 million.
 
Commercial Aircraft – Subcontracts with Prime Contractors
 
G650/G650ER: The Gulfstream G650 is a twin-engine business jet airplane produced by Gulfstream Aerospace that can be configured to carry from 11 to 18 passengers. Gulfstream began the G650 program in 2005 and revealed it to the public in 2008. The G650 is Gulfstream’s largest and fastest business jet. The G650ER is an extended range version of the aircraft. In 2020, Gulfstream announced the launch of a new derivative the G700. In March 2008, Spirit AeroSystems, Inc. awarded us a contract to provide fixed leading edges (FLE) for the Gulfstream G650 business jet, and derivative models, a commercial program that Spirit was supporting. In December 2014, Spirit transferred its work-scope on this program to Triumph Group. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, in May 2020, Triumph Group cancelled nearly all open orders with the Company. On May 27, 2020, Triumph Group announced it had reached an agreement in principle to sell the G650 wing program to Gulfstream Aerospace, and on June 12, 2020, we received a joint communication from Gulfstream Aerospace and Triumph Group that stated Gulfstream’s intention at the conclusion of the transaction is to continue to purchase G650 wing components from the Company. In December 2020, we received purchase orders directly from Gulfstream for wing components for use on the G650, G650ER and/or G700 aircraft.
Phenom 300: The Phenom 300 is a twin-engine, executive jet produced by Brazilian aircraft company Embraer, S.A. that can carry between 6 and 10 passengers and a crew of 2. We have been producing engine inlet assemblies for Embraer under a long-term agreement we entered into in 2012. We have received approximately $36 million in orders on this program through December 31 2020. We estimate the potential value of the program to be in excess of $52 million.
Sales and Marketing
 
We are recognized within the aerospace industry as a Tier 1 or Tier 2 supplier to major aircraft suppliers. Additionally, we may bid for military contracts set aside specifically for small businesses.
 
We are generally awarded initial contracts for our products and services through the process of competitive bidding. This process begins when we first learn, formally or otherwise, of a potential contract from a prospective customer and concludes after all negotiations are completed upon award. When preparing our response to a prospective customer for a potential contract, we evaluate the contract requirements and determine and outline the services and products we can provide to fulfill the contract at a competitive price.
 
Many times for our defense programs, after the initial contract, subsequent follow-on contracts are awarded on a sole-source basis, subject to cost-justification and direct negotiation with our customer and in some cases, the federal government.
 
Our average sales cycle, which generally commences at the time a prospective customer issues a request for proposal and ends upon delivery of the final product to the customer, varies widely.
 
Because of the complexities inherent in the aerospace industry, the time from the initial request for proposal to award ranges from as little as a few weeks to several years. Additionally, our contracts have ranged from six months to as long as 10 years. Also, repeat and follow-on jobs for current contracts frequently provide additional opportunities with minimal start-up costs and rapid rates to production.
 
The Market
 
We have positioned our Company to take advantage of opportunities in the military aerospace market to a broad customer base, thereby reducing the impact of direct government contracting limitations. Our success as a subcontractor to defense prime contractors has provided us with opportunities to act as a subcontractor to prime contractors in the production of commercial aircraft structures, which also reduced our exposure to government spending decisions.
 
Over time, our Company has expanded in both size and capabilities, with growth in our operational and global supply chain program management. These expansions have allowed us the ability to supply more complex aerostructure assemblies and aerosystems and structures in support of our government-based programs as well as to pursue opportunities within the commercial and business jet markets. Our capabilities have also allowed us to acquire MRO and kitting contracts.
 
9


Approximately $2.9 million and $3.3 million of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were from customers outside the U.S. All other revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 has been attributable to customers within the U.S. We have no assets outside the U.S.
 
Government-based contracts are subject to national defense budget and procurement funding decisions that, accordingly, drive demand for our business in that market. Government spending and budgeting for procurement, operations and maintenance are affected not only by military action, but also the related fiscal consequences of these actions, as well as the political process.
 
Backlog
 
We produce custom assemblies pursuant to long-term contracts and customer purchase orders. Funded backlog consists of aggregate funded values under such contracts and purchase orders, excluding the portion previously included in operating revenues pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 (“ASC606”). Unfunded backlog is the estimated amount of future orders under the expected duration of the program. Substantially all of our backlog is subject to termination at will and rescheduling, without significant penalty. Funds are often appropriated for programs or contracts on a yearly or quarterly basis, even though the contract may call for performance that is expected to take a number of years. Therefore, our funded backlog does not include the full value of our contracts.
 
The total backlog at December 31, 2020 is primarily comprised of long-term programs with Raytheon (NGJ-MB), Northrop Grumman (E-2D), USAF (T-38), Boeing (A-10), and Embraer (Phenom 300). Funded backlog is primarily from purchase orders under long-term contracts with Northrop Grumman (E-2D), Sikorsky (BLACK HAWK), Lockheed Martin (F-16V), and the USAF (T-38). Approximately 54% of the funded backlog at December 31, 2020 is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2021.
 
Our total backlog as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:
 

Backlog (Total) | December 31, 2020 | | December 31, 2019 | 
-----------------+-------------------+-------------+-------------------+--
Funded | $ | 169,567,000 | | $ | 147,647,000
Unfunded | | 306,618,000 | | | 414,231,000
Total | $ | 476,185,000 | | $ | 561,878,000

 
Approximately 96% of the total amount of our backlog at December 31, 2020 was attributable to government contracts, compared to 88% at December 31, 2019. Our backlog attributable to government contracts at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:
 

Backlog (Government) | December 31, 2020 | | December 31, 2019 | 
---------------------+-------------------+--------------+-------------------+--
Funded | $ | 166,156,000 | | $ | 136,932,000
Unfunded | | 290,632,000 | | | 359,770,000
Total | | 456,788, 000 | | $ | 496,702,000

 
Our backlog attributable to commercial contracts at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:
 

Backlog (Commercial) | December 31, 2020 | | December 31, 2019 | 
---------------------+-------------------+------------+-------------------+--
Funded | $ | 3,411,000 | | $ | 10,715,000
Unfunded | | 15,986,000 | | | 54,461,000
Total | $ | 19,397,000 | | $ | 65,176,000

Material and Parts
 
We subcontract production of substantially all parts incorporated into our products to third-party manufacturers under firm fixed price orders. Our decision to purchase certain components generally is based upon whether the components are available to meet required specifications at a cost and with a delivery schedule consistent with customer requirements. From time to time, we are required to purchase custom made parts from sole suppliers and manufacturers in order to meet specific customer requirements.
 
10


We obtain our raw materials from several commercial sources. Although certain items are only available from limited sources of supply, we believe that the loss of any single supplier would not have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Competition
 
We face competition in our role as both a prime contractor to the U.S. Government and as a Tier 1 or Tier 2 subcontractor to military and commercial aircraft manufacturers. Within our aerostructures capability, we often compete against much larger Tier 1 suppliers, such as Triumph Group, Spirit AeroSystems, Kaman Aerospace, GKN, Ducommun, and LMI Aerospace. We believe that we can compete effectively with these larger companies by delivering products with the same level of quality and performance at a better value for our customer. Within our aerosystems capability, such as our portfolio of EW and ISR integrated pod structures, we find more limited competition and are not aware of competition from any of the aerostructures companies mentioned above. In these cases, we typically compete with the internal manufacturing arm of our customer. We believe our unique skills related to integrated pod structures combined with a very efficient and generally much lower cost structure creates a competitive advantage for bidding on aerosystems contracts.
 
For certain unrestricted contracts for the U.S. Government, we may compete against well-established prime contractors, including NGC, Lockheed Martin, and Boeing. All of these competitors possess significantly larger infrastructures, greater resources and the capabilities to respond to much larger contracts. We believe that our competitive advantage lies in our ability to offer large contractor capabilities with the flexibility and responsiveness of a small company, while staying competitive in cost and delivering superior quality products. While larger prime contractors compete for significant modification awards, they generally do not compete for awards in smaller modifications, spares and replacement parts, even for aircraft for which they are the original manufacturer. In certain instances, the large prime contractors often subcontract much of the work they win to their Tier 1 suppliers so we also may act as a subcontractor to some of these major prime contractors. Further, in some cases these companies are not permitted to bid, for example when the U.S. Government designates a contract as a Small Business Set-Aside. In these restricted contracts for the U.S. Government, CPI Aero typically competes against numerous small business competitors. We believe we compete effectively against the smaller competitors because smaller competitors generally do not have the expertise we have in responding to requests for proposals for government contracts, nor will they typically have the more than 40 years of past performance in conducting thousands of contracts for the U.S. Government.
 
COVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic Impact on Our Business
 
The outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization during our first quarter of 2020. During the latter part of our first quarter and subsequent to our quarter end, the COVID-19 pandemic grew, causing non-essential businesses to shut down and many people to observe the shelter-in-place directive from our state government. Our business and operations and the industries in which we operate have been impacted by public and private sector policies and initiatives in the U.S. to address the transmission of COVID-19, such as the imposition of travel restrictions and the adoption of remote work. The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to a general slowdown in the global economy, has adversely impacted the businesses of certain of our customers and suppliers, and, if it continues for an extended period of time, it could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. In response to the COVID-19 impact on our business, we have been and continue to actively mitigate costs. We have also been taking actions to preserve capital and protect the long-term needs of our businesses, including negotiating progress payments with our customers and reducing discretionary spending. For more information on the current and potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, see Risk Factors included in Part I, Item 1A of this Comprehensive Form 10-K/A.
Government Regulation
 
Environmental Regulation
 
We are subject to regulations administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, various state agencies and county and local authorities acting in cooperation with federal and state authorities. Among other things, these regulatory bodies impose restrictions to control air, soil and water pollution, to protect against occupational exposure to chemicals, including health and safety risks, and to require notification or reporting of the storage, use and release of certain hazardous chemicals and substances. The extensive regulatory framework imposes compliance burdens and risks on us. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with these regulations and to obtain injunctions or impose civil and criminal fines in the case of violations.
 
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”) imposes strict, joint and several liability on the present and former owners and operators of facilities that release hazardous substances into the environment. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (“RCRA”) regulates the generation, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous waste. In New York State, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances are governed by the Environmental Conservation Law, which contains the New York counterparts of CERCLA and RCRA. In addition, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which requires employers to provide a place of employment that is free from recognized and preventable hazards that are likely to cause serious physical harm to employees, obligates employers to provide notice to employees regarding the presence of hazardous chemicals and to train employees in the use of such substances.
 
11


Our operations require the use of a limited amount of chemicals and other materials for painting and cleaning, including solvents and thinners, which are classified under applicable laws as hazardous chemicals and substances. We have obtained a permit from the Town of Islip, New York, Building Division in order to maintain a paint booth containing flammable liquids.
 
Federal Aviation Administration Regulation
 
We are subject to regulation by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) under the provisions of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended. The FAA prescribes standards and licensing requirements for aircraft and aircraft components. We are subject to inspections by the FAA and may be subjected to fines and other penalties (including orders to cease production) for noncompliance with FAA regulations. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of or our disqualification from some of our contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
Government Contract Compliance
 
Our government contracts and sub-contracts are subject to the procurement rules and regulations of the U.S. Government. Many of the contract terms are dictated by these rules and regulations. Specifically, cost-based pricing is determined under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”), which provide guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S. Government contracts. For example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, advertising, interest expense, and public relations are unallowable, and therefore not recoverable through sales. During and after the fulfillment of a government contract, we may be audited in respect of the direct and allocated indirect costs attributed thereto. These audits may result in adjustments to our contract costs. Additionally, we may be subject to U.S. Government inquiries and investigations because of our participation in government procurement. Any inquiry or investigation can result in fines or limitations on our ability to continue to bid for government contracts and fulfill existing contracts. We believe that we are in compliance with all federal, state and local laws and regulations governing our operations and have obtained all material licenses and permits required for the operation of our business.
 
The U.S. Government generally has the ability to terminate our contracts, in whole or in part, without prior notice, for convenience or for default based on performance. If a U.S. Government contract were to be terminated for convenience, we generally would be protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contract and profit on those costs, but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed. In the unusual circumstance where a U.S. Government contract does not have such termination protection, we attempt to mitigate the termination risk through other means. Termination resulting from our default may expose us to liability and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for other contracts. The U.S. Government also has the ability to stop work under a contract for a limited period of time for its convenience. In the event of a stop work order, we generally would be protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contract to date and for costs associated with the temporary stoppage of work on the contract. However, such temporary stoppages and delays could introduce inefficiencies for which we may not be able to negotiate full recovery from the U.S. Government, and could ultimately result in termination for convenience or reduced future orders on certain contracts. Additionally, we may be required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. Government contracts, even if the U.S. Government is unable to make timely payments.
 
Insurance
 
We maintain a $2 million general liability insurance policy, a $100 million products liability insurance policy, and a $5 million umbrella liability insurance policy. Additionally, we maintain $15 million of director and officers’ insurance. We believe this coverage is adequate for claims that have been and may be brought against us, and for the types of products presently marketed because of the strict inspection standards imposed on us by our customers before they take possession of our products. Additionally, the FAR generally provide that we will not be held liable for any loss of or damage to property of the U.S. Government that occurs after the U.S. Government accepts delivery of our products and that results from any defects or deficiencies in our products unless the liability results from willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of our managerial personnel.
Proprietary Information
 
None of our current assembly processes or products is protected by patents. We rely on proprietary know-how and information and employ various methods to protect the processes, concepts, ideas and documentation associated with our products. These methods, however, may not afford complete protection and there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop such processes, concepts, ideas and documentation.

In addition, we have taken measures to protect our workforce in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including allowing employees to work from home when possible and implementing safety protocols to support our essential employees required to work onsite, such as making changes to shift work to promote social distancing among our manufacturing personnel, and providing masks and hand sanitizer.
