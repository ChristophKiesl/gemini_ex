ITEM 1 - BUSINESS

Description of Business and Industry

The principal business of Superior Industries International, Inc. (referred to herein as the “company” or “we,” “us” and “our”) is the design and manufacture of aluminum wheels for sale to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"). We are one of the largest suppliers of cast aluminum wheels to the world's leading automobile and light truck manufacturers, with manufacturing operations in the United States ("U.S.") and Mexico. Customers in North America represent the principal market for our products. Our OEM aluminum wheels are primarily sold for factory installation, as either optional or standard equipment, on many vehicle models manufactured by BMW, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. ("FCA"), Ford, General Motors ("GM"), Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru, Tesla, Toyota and Volkswagen.
Historically our business focus primarily was on providing wheels for relatively high-volume programs with lower degrees of competitive differentiation. In order to improve our strategic position, we continue to augment our product portfolio with wheels containing higher technical content and greater differentiation. We believe this direction is consistent with the trend of the market and needs of our customers. In connection with this strategic advancement, we opened a new plant in Mexico in 2015 and continue to invest in new manufacturing processes targeting the more sophisticated finishes and larger diameter products which typically have more value. At the same time, we also continue to explore and implement operating improvements to enhance efficiencies and lower cost. As part of our continued strategy to provide our customers with premium finishes, we began building a physical vapor deposition ("PVD") finishing facility next to one of our already existing facilities. PVD is a finishing method that creates bright chrome-like surfaces with an environmentally friendly process. Because the majority of our customer programs are planned two or three years in advance, the upgrade of our product portfolio will evolve over time.
The diversification of the product portfolio into larger wheels and premium finishes could result in higher margins and continued growth in earnings. The diluted earnings per share has improved significantly over the last three years due mainly to the improvement in gross margin, which is attributed to increased unit sales and cost efficiency initiatives. The charts below show our 2016 major customers, key highlights for 2016 and the improvement in diluted earnings per share.
Demand for our products is mainly driven by light-vehicle production levels in North America. The North American light-vehicle production level in 2016 was 17.8 million vehicles, a 3 percent or 0.4 million unit increase over 2015. The 2016 North American production level was one of the highest in the history of the industry. We track annual production rates based on information from Ward's Automotive Group. Current economic conditions, low consumer interest rates and relatively inexpensive gas prices have generally been supportive of market growth and, in addition, the record high average age of vehicles on the road appears to be contributing to higher rates of vehicle replacement. It was reported in 2016 that the average age of all light vehicles in the U.S. increased to an all-time high of 11.6 years, according to IHS Automotive.
In 2015, production of automobiles and light-duty trucks in North America reached 17.4 million units, an increase of 3 percent over 2014. Production in 2014 reached 16.9 million units, an increase of 5 percent, from 16.1 million vehicles in 2013.

Raw Materials
The raw materials used in manufacturing our products are readily available and are obtained through numerous suppliers with whom we have established trade relations. Purchased aluminum accounted for the vast majority of our total raw material requirements during 2016. The majority of our aluminum requirements are met through purchase orders with certain major producers, with physical supply primarily coming from North American production locations. Generally, aluminum purchase orders are fixed as to minimum and maximum quantities, which the producers must supply and we must purchase during the term of the orders. During 2016, we were able to successfully secure aluminum commitments from our primary suppliers to meet production requirements and we anticipate being able to source aluminum requirements to meet our expected level of production in 2017. We procure other raw materials through numerous suppliers with whom we have established trade relationships.
When market conditions warrant, we may also enter into purchase commitments to secure the supply of certain commodities used in the manufacture of our products, such as aluminum, natural gas and other raw materials. We had no purchase commitments in place for the delivery of aluminum, natural gas or other raw materials in 2016. 
Customer Dependence
We have proven our ability to be a consistent producer of high quality aluminum wheels with the capability to meet our customers' price, quality, delivery and service requirements. We strive to continually enhance our relationships with our customers through continuous improvement programs, not only through our manufacturing operations but in the engineering, design, development and quality areas as well. These key business relationships have resulted in multiple vehicle supply contract awards with our key customers in the past few years.
Ford, GM, Toyota and FCA were our only customers individually accounting for more than 10 percent of our consolidated trade sales. Net sales to these customers in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows (dollars in millions):

 | 2016 | 2015 | 2014 
 | Percent of Net Sales | Dollars | Percent of Net Sales | Dollars | Percent of Net Sales | Dollars
Ford | 38% | $271.4 | 44% | $315.1 | 44% | $321.6 
GM | 30% | $216.4 | 24% | $175.6 | 24% | $175.8 
Toyota | 14% | $98.4 | 14% | $104.5 | 12% | $88.3 
FCA | 6% | $44.4 | 8% | $56.3 | 10% | $72.0 

The loss of all or a substantial portion of our sales to Ford, GM, Toyota or FCA would have a significant adverse effect on our financial results. See also Item 1A - "Risk Factors" of this Annual Report.
Foreign Operations
We manufacture a significant portion of our products in Mexico that are sold both in the U.S. and Mexico. Net sales of wheels manufactured in our Mexico operations in 2016 totaled $612.3 million and represented 84 percent of our total net sales. We anticipate that the portion of our products produced in Mexico versus the U.S. will remain comparable in 2017. Net property, plant and equipment used in our operations in Mexico totaled $189.6 million at December 31, 2016. The overall cost for us to manufacture wheels in Mexico currently is lower than the cost to manufacture wheels in the U.S., in particular, because of reduced labor costs relating to lower prevailing wage rates. Such current advantages to manufacturing our product in Mexico may be affected by changes in cost structures, tariffs imposed by the U.S., trade protection laws, policies and other regulations affecting trade and investments, social, political, labor, or general economic conditions in Mexico. Other factors that can affect the business and financial results of our Mexican operations include, but are not limited to, valuation of the peso, availability and competency of personnel and tax regulations in Mexico. See also Item 1A, "Risk Factors - Our international operations and international trade agreements make us vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries that can affect our business, financial condition and results of operations" and Item 1A, "Risk Factors - Fluctuations in foreign currencies may adversely impact our financial condition."

Net Sales Backlog
We receive OEM purchase orders typically for one year for vehicle wheel programs that usually last three to five years. We manufacture and ship based on customer release schedules, normally provided on a weekly basis, which can vary in part due to changes in market demand, industry and/or customer maintenance cycles, new program introductions or dealer inventory levels. While we have long term commitments for our wheel programs from our customers, the quantity is restricted to weekly demand schedules. Since the release schedules are based on weekly demand from our customers, the backlog is not significant and is not a meaningful indicator of our future operating results.
Competition
Competition in the market for aluminum wheels is based primarily on price, technology, quality, delivery and overall customer service. We are the largest producer of aluminum wheels for OEM installations in North America. We currently supply approximately 21 percent of the aluminum wheels installed on passenger cars and light-duty trucks in North America. Competition is global in nature with a significant volume of exports from Asia into North America. There are several competitors with facilities in North America but we have more than twice the North American production capacity of any competitor based on our current estimation. See also Item 1A., "Risk Factors" of this Annual Report. Other types of road wheels, such as those made of steel, also compete with our products. According to Ward's Automotive Group, the aluminum wheel penetration rate on passenger cars and light-duty trucks in the U.S. was 81 percent for the 2016 model year and 79 percent for the 2015 model year, compared to 81 percent for the 2014 model year. We expect the aluminum wheel penetration rate to remain relatively stable. However, several factors can affect this rate including price, fuel economy requirements and styling preference. Although aluminum wheels currently are more costly than steel, aluminum is a lighter material than steel, which is desirable for fuel efficiency and generally viewed as aesthetically superior to steel and thus, more desirable to the OEMs and their customers. 
Research and Development
Our policy is to continuously review, improve and develop our engineering capabilities to satisfy our customer requirements in the most efficient and cost effective manner available. We strive to achieve this objective by attracting and retaining top engineering talent and by maintaining the latest state-of-the-art computer technology to support engineering development. A fully staffed engineering center, located in Fayetteville, Arkansas, supports our research and development manufacturing needs. We also have a technical sales function at our corporate headquarters in Southfield, Michigan that maintains a complement of engineering staff located near some of our largest customers' headquarters and engineering and purchasing offices.
Research and development costs (primarily engineering and related costs), which are expensed as incurred, are included in cost of sales in our consolidated income statements. Amounts expended on research and development costs during each of the last three years were $3.8 million in 2016; $2.6 million in 2015; and $4.4 million in 2014.
Government Regulation
Safety standards in the manufacture of vehicles and automotive equipment have been established under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, as amended. We believe that we are in compliance with all federal standards currently applicable to OEM suppliers and to automotive manufacturers.
Environmental Compliance
Our manufacturing facilities, like most other manufacturing companies, are subject to solid waste, water and air pollution control standards mandated by federal, state and local laws. Violators of these laws are subject to fines and, in extreme cases, plant closure. We believe our facilities are in material compliance with all presently applicable standards. However, costs related to environmental protection may grow due to increasingly stringent laws and regulations. The cost of environmental compliance was approximately $0.4 million in 2016, $0.7 million in 2015 and $0.4 million in 2014. We expect that future environmental compliance expenditures will approximate these levels and will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position. Furthermore, climate change legislation or regulations restricting emission of "greenhouse gases" could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the vehicles that use our products. See also Item 1A, - "Risk Factors - We are subject to various environmental laws" of this Annual Report.

Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 4,189 full-time employees and 682 contract employees compared to approximately 3,050 full-time employees and 719 contract employees at December 31, 2015. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The increase in employees in 2016 was due in part to the operational inefficiencies we experienced at one of our plants. See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations."
Fiscal Year End
Our fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending generally on the last Sunday of the calendar year. The fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 comprised the 52-week periods ended on December 25, 2016, December 27, 2015 and December 28, 2014, respectively. For convenience of presentation, all fiscal years are referred to as beginning as of January 1, and ending as of December 31, but actually reflect our financial position and results of operations for the periods described above.
Segment Information
We operate as a single integrated business and, as such, have only one operating segment - automotive wheels. Financial information about this segment and geographic areas is contained in Note 5, "Business Segments" in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report.
Seasonal Variations
The automotive industry is cyclical and varies based on the timing of consumer purchases of vehicles, which in turn vary based on a variety of factors such as general economic conditions, availability of consumer credit, interest rates and fuel costs. While there have been no significant seasonal variations in the past few years, production schedules in our industry can vary significantly from quarter to quarter to meet the scheduling demands of our customers.
History
We were initially incorporated in Delaware in 1969. Our entry into the OEM aluminum wheel business in 1973 resulted from our successful development of manufacturing technology, quality control and quality assurance techniques that enabled us to satisfy the quality and volume requirements of the OEM market for aluminum wheels. The first aluminum wheel for a domestic OEM customer was a Mustang wheel for Ford Motor Company. We reincorporated in California in 1994, and in 2015, we moved our headquarters from Van Nuys, California to Southfield, Michigan and reincorporated in Delaware. Our stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "SUP."
