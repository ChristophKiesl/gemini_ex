ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Information

Following the acquisition and subsequent investment into the further development of the Boatim trading platform, Boatim Inc. successfully launched its online boat trading marketplace platform (boatim.com) during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021, making it the company’s primary business activity.

Boatim Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada as Emerald Data Inc., a for-profit company on August 15, 2014 and established a fiscal year end of August 31. On January 24th, 2019, the company name was changed to Boatim Inc. On April 29, 2019, Mr Wolfgang Tippner was appointed as a director and CEO of the company. On June 22, 2021, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Joseph Johnson, as a member of the Board of Directors and as Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Tippner resigned from his position as CEO and Mr. Johnson began his tenure on July 2, 2021.

The largest shareholder of Boatim Inc. with a holding of 32,766,667 shares of common stocks is JTT Global Ventures Ltd. That position represents 63.28% of the Company’s voting rights.

Boatim, Inc. established Boatim Europe S.L. (“Boatim Europe”) as a private limited company pursuant to the laws of Spain on December 18, 2019, with the Company having indirect control of one hundred percent of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Boatim Europe. Boatim Europe commenced operations in February 2020 and is engaged in the business of providing software development, marketing, and selling services for Boatim Inc.

All membership interests of Boatim Europe are currently held in trust by the Company´s CEO for practical reasons and only until the formal transfer into the name of Company has been completed according to the requirements of applicable Spanish law. In December 2020, the Company finalized the process of collecting and submitting all required paperwork to the Spanish authorities to enter Boatim Inc. as direct owner on public records in Spain, making Boatim Europe a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.

On February 27, 2020 the Company received OTC approval on its uplisting to the OTCQB venture market exchange, which is a well recognized trading market for smaller fast growing companies which meet certain reporting and transparency procedures, which are a prerequisite to be admitted to this market. The Company trades under the ticker symbol “BTIM”.

On May 29, 2020, the uplisting was followed by DTC´s confirmation and setting live of the Company´s stock DWAC capability, a technical back-end feature allowing brokers to clear the Company´s stocks directly broker to broker – a capability allowing for fast and seamless settlements and thus commonly better trading volumes in a stock.

Principal Products, Services, and Their Markets

Since the acquisition of the Boatim software platform and the creation of an additional business line, management has focused on operating a global online boat marketplace as its primary business line. 

We intend to combine our strengths in data-driven technology businesses, the growing online boating community, and our digital marketing capabilities to offer a rolling subscription for service model of access to the Boatim platform for the extensive market of global boat dealers, and intend to establish steady revenue streams this way. Our connection with the online communities in key markets, as well as our presence in the key boating communities of Florida and Barcelona, Spain, will be of substantial benefit when further rolling out our online marketplace product to dealers. Dealers will be able to purchase additional options to boost their listings, for example “Featured Listings”. In order to make the process as smooth and seamless as possible for new customers, Boatim recently launched in beta its Smart Connected InventoryTM offering, allowing dealers to automatically connect and manage their inventory on the Boatim platform.

With the Boatim platform intended to attract many boat owners and sellers, we are creating a growing social and commercial community around the subject of boats. The community will be enhanced by relevant boating content from various sources, including internally developed by Boatim’s own team. As the community grows in size and activity, it is intended to attract boat manufacturers, boat show promoters, and other trade players, which will create an additional revenue stream for paid advertising and sponsored content. 

Marketing

To extend and publicize the latest industry trends, and promote its clients’ listings, Boatim Inc. intends to use direct and online marketing methods attract visitors to the platform to advertise their business.

We intend to further expand the business with affiliate programs which will over time offer buyers a broader scope of services needed to successfully complete the hassle-free acquisition of a boat, including insurance, financing, and contract services. Where customers are referred through an affiliate program and ultimately make a completed purchase, we intend to receive a revenue share from the affiliate partner.

Market Overview

The world has arrived solidly in the next generation of connectivity and digital services and products. Regardless of industry, digital marketing and selling is increasingly used as a company’s primary marketing tool for sales and services, thus increasing market reach and even introducing entirely new distribution channels.

The boating market has 24.2 million private boat owners, and more than 1.5 million used boats are traded annually. For every boat owner, there are 5 prospective owners or those who are seriously interested in owning one. We estimate that there are over 100,000 relevant participants in the boat and yacht industry worldwide.

According to research by Grand View Research, Inc., in 2019 the global market size for the new and used leisure boat market was $39.75 billion, and for the leisure boat rental market, $6.5 billion. 

Initial observations and media articles indicate that boating as a leisure and recreational activity has not suffered from a loss of interest as a result of the current global novel coronavirus pandemic. In fact, several market participants have noticed an increase in demand for leisure boats, given their ability to support distancing from other watercraft and their users, and the benefits of outdoor activity.

Competition

There are several competing marketplaces for the buying, selling, and chartering of boats. Their competitive offers vary according to location, target segments, and approach to advertising and marketing. Boatim intends to establish a strong competitive offering against competing marketplaces by virtue of building digital products with an enhanced user experience, using data-driven analytics and technology, and dynamic marketing and digital advertising methods.
