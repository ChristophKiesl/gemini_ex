ITEM 1. | BUSINESS OVERVIEW
--------+------------------

 We are a vertically integrated, advanced materials provider specializing in monocrystalline sapphire for applications in optical and industrial systems. We design, assemble and maintain our own proprietary crystal growth furnaces to grow high-purity, low-stress, ultra-low-defect-density sapphire crystals. We apply our proprietary crystal growth technology to produce high-quality sapphire products to meet our customers exacting specifications. Sapphire is a desirable material for high-performance applications due to its hardness and strength, transparency in the visible and IR spectrum, thermal conductivity, thermal shock resistance, abrasion resistance, high melting point and chemical inertness. As a result, it is ideally suited for extreme environments in a range of industries where material durability is just as important as optical clarity.
 Historically, we have also provided sapphire products to the LED and mobile device markets, which are the largest markets for sapphire. The LED and mobile device markets for sapphire have attracted significant investment in sapphire production in China, which has resulted in oversupply and low pricing. We had been trying to stay in the LED substrate market by limiting our product offering to six-inch diameter wafers and working hard to reduce cost to make this product profitable. While we made significant progress on that front, the continual decline of prices made the prospects of becoming profitable in the LED substrate market unlikely for the foreseeable future. As a result, in September 2016, we announced our decision to limit our focus to the optical and industrial sapphire markets and exit the LED and mobile device markets. While these are smaller markets, we believe that due to more challenging customer requirements, competition is more limited and margin opportunities are greater. We believe our high quality crystal, strong and developing U.S. customer base, and optical finishing capability are strong differentiators from our competitors in the optical and industrial sapphire markets, and we believe there may be emerging applications in these markets. 
 With the decision to exit the LED market, we transitioned our patterning equipment to a strategic customer and subsequently closed our plant in Penang, Malaysia and are attempting to sell the real estate and equipment located there. We stopped production activities in November 2016 and ceased all operations in Penang, Malaysia in December 2016. Our wafer patterning equipment in Penang, Malaysia was sold in the fourth quarter of 2016 for $4.5 million, and we have structured and begun an auction process to attempt to sell the polishing and fabrication equipment. Additionally, our Malaysia real estate is currently on the market. The timing of the sale of the real estate is difficult to predict. 
 Focusing on smaller optical and industrial sapphire markets also means that we now have excess crystal growth and fabrication capacity in the U.S. We are in the process of consolidating operations into our leased spaces in Bensenville, Illinois and Franklin Park, Illinois and vacating our largest owned facility in Batavia, Illinois. The relocation is now near completion and we are planning a second auction for the excess equipment in the Batavia plant in the next 60 days. The plant itself is a special purpose facility with extensive enhancements to power and water-cooling systems required for crystal growth production. We are also actively selling this property and our initial focus is to seek a buyer that is interested in both the building and improved infrastructure. Timing on the sale of this real estate is also difficult to predict. 
 With the shutdown of our Malaysia operations and downsizing of our U.S. operations, we have reduced overall company headcount from 220 at September 30, 2016 to 40 at February 28, 2017. However, we have been careful to maintain the employee knowledge base in our strategic markets built over the past 15 years. 
 Historically, we sold sapphire cores into the mobile device market and sapphire cores and wafers into the LED market. With the cessation of our LED-related production activities at our Malaysia facility, in future periods we expect our LED revenue will cease. We anticipate that our sales will be almost exclusively from optical and industrial sapphire components. The following table summarizes optical revenue for each of the last three years: 
 

Year ended December 31, | Optical revenue(in thousands) | | % of totalrevenue
2016 | $ | 4,568 | | 23 | %
2015 | $ | 5,086 | | 21 | %
2014 | $ | 7,057 | | 15 | %

 We operate in an extremely volatile market, so our ability to expand our optical and industrial business and acceptance of new product offerings is difficult to predict. 
 In addition, our optical and industrial sapphire business serves smaller markets than our historical undertakings, so we are actively evaluating the acquisition of profitable companies both in and outside of the sapphire market in order to accelerate growth and to utilize our substantial net tax loss carry-forwards. Because acquisitions are being given greater consideration, in February 2017, we commenced a search for a new Chief Executive Officer (CEO) with more extensive experience in mergers and acquisitions. On March 16, 2017, we announced the appointment of Timothy E. Brog as our new President and CEO, effective as of March 17, 2017. Mr. Brog has served on our Board of Directors since May 2016 and will continue to serve as a director of the Company.

 INDUSTRY OVERVIEW 
 Sapphire is utilized in optical and industrial applications. It is used for windows and optics for aerospace, sensor, medical, semiconductor, instrumentation, electronics and laser applications due to its wide-band transmission, superior strength, chemical and scratch resistance and high strength-to-weight ratio. Sapphires physical and optical properties also make it very well suited for defense applications such as electro-optical and sensor suite windows for military fighter jets, helicopters, unmanned air vehicles and ships, forward-looking infrared windows for commercial and business aircrafts as well as missile domes, submarine windows and components and transparent armor for military vehicles. These markets are growing as new applications for sapphire emerge for larger size and higher quality sapphire components and also due to the availability of more cost effective sapphire part production. 
TECHNOLOGY 
 Our proprietary crystal growth technique, which we refer to as ES2, produces high-quality sapphire crystals for use in our sapphire products. ES2 is derived from the standard Kyropoulos method of crystal growth. We developed this technique with the goal of establishing greater control over the crystal growth process while maintaining minimal temperature variations. Unlike other techniques, during the ES2 technique, the growing sapphire crystal exists in an unconstrained, low stress environment inside a closed growth chamber. The closed system allows for enhanced control of the melt, resulting in higher quality crystals. The temperature gradient between the melt and the crystal in the ES2 technique is significantly lower than in other crystal growth techniques. These aspects of the ES2 technique enable us to grow crystals that have a significantly lower dislocation density, higher crystal purity and greater uniformity than sapphire crystals grown using other techniques. The ES2 technique provides an inherent annealing process once the crystal is fully grown. This thermal annealing is an integral means of relieving stress in the crystal during the ES2 process. We have demonstrated the ability to readily scale our ES2 technology in a production environment while maintaining high crystal quality even as crystal boule size is increased. 
 We have automated the crystal growth process of our proprietary ES2 technique. Our furnace environments are controlled by closed-loop control systems and the overall crystal growth process is run with minimal operator intervention, which reduces the potential for human error. In addition, a single operator can supervise the control of multiple ES2 furnaces simultaneously, which reduces costs. 
 We have now completed crystal growth development for our Large Area Net Shaped Crystal Extraction (LANCE) technology, which is a technology designed to produce very large, thick sapphire windows. This technology was developed with government funding under a contract with the Air Force Research Laboratory. We have now completed the window blank deliverables on this project, including the largest size sapphire window available in the world at 36 x 18 x 1 inch dimensions. While the project will not be fully completed until our subcontractors complete the polishing of the windows, we have received permission from the government to begin selling and commercializing LANCE sapphire products. We will continue to refine the process to improve yield; however, our main focus now is the development of the market for these larger windows. The product has been displayed at trade shows and has attracted interest both from military and industrial product developers. 
 We also continue development of our family of aluminum oxide-based, clear optical coatings for glass and quartz parts that provide most of the durability of sapphire at a lower cost. We have branded the coatings SapphirEX. We have provided samples of coated glass and quartz to a number of prospective customers for products in the retail scanner, semiconductor processing, defense and consumer electronics markets. We continue to work on active qualification for use in the point of sale (POS) scanner market with some of our samples being tested in stores. We feel that initially we are more likely to find a number of niche markets, such as POS scanners, but also believe there is potential to address larger markets, such as smart phones and tablets and we are providing samples for smart-phone after-market cover glass as well as the OEM market for ruggedized mobile applications. We are focusing on building contract manufacturing relationships that we can rely on for production volumes in order to avoid major capital expenditures. 
 PRODUCTS 
 We believe the developing optical and industrial segments of the market require large diameter sapphire products, high quality sapphire and ultra-thin double side polished windows and wafers which many sapphire producers do not have the capability to provide. In addition, military applications often require a U.S. based source for sapphire. We believe we continue to have a reputation for producing the highest quality sapphire in the market. We also have the ability to maintain that crystal quality while growing crystal in very large formats, we have a strong and developing U.S. customer base, and we have the ability to provide very high performance ultra-thin double side polished sapphire products, which we believe position us well in these markets.

We provide optical and industrial sapphire products in various shapes and sizes, including round and rectangular windows and blanks, domes, tubes and rods. These optical sapphire products are qualified and used in equipment for a wide variety of end markets and high performance applications including defense and aerospace, specialty lighting, instrumentation, sensors and detectors, semiconductor process equipment, electronic substrates, medical and laser applications. 
 We believe we offer the industrys largest sapphire windows and highest quality, ultra-thin, double side polished windows and substrates. Our product lines include very thin, double-side polished windows as thin as 300 microns for 6 optical windows, and also very large-area blanks and polished windows. We offer round C-plane sapphire windows up to 11 in diameter and A-plane windows up to 18in diameter with UV grade windows up to 13.5 in diameter. We also have produced sapphire window blanks at 18 x 36 x 1 dimensions. 
 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
 Our research and development (R&D) activity plays a vital role in supporting our technology, product and revenue roadmaps. In 2016 and 2015, our R&D expenses totaled $2.5 million and $2.2 million, respectively. However, the scope of R&D projects has recently been reduced, and we expect R&D expenses to be significantly lower in 2017. These expenses generally do not include costs incurred in connection with our R&D activities under the LANCE government contract. However, in 2016 we recorded estimated costs of $217,000 in excess of the contract value at December 31, 2016. 
 Activities under the LANCE government contract up to the contract value are accounted for as revenue and cost of goods sold. We record R&D revenue associated with the LANCE government contract as costs are incurred plus a fixed fee. For each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 revenue from R&D accounted for less than 10% of our revenue. Since 2012, we have recorded $4.3 million in revenue and the total value of the contract is $4.7 million. As LANCE is largely complete, we expect our R&D revenue as a percentage of total revenue to be significantly lower in 2017, despite overall revenue being lower due to our exit from the LED market. 
 MANUFACTURING 
 The process of growing the crystal begins by heating the raw material, aluminum oxide, until it reaches an ideal temperature above its melting point. This ideal temperature is essential for our process because it allows us to produce high-purity crystals with very low defect rates. Following the heating, a seed rod is inserted in the melted material as the material is being cooled to crystallize into a boule. Following the growth process, each boule is rigorously inspected by using polarized lighting and magnification to find imperfections, such as bubbles, dislocations and granular deposits within the crystal. 
 We then drill the resulting boules into cylindrical cores using our custom high-precision crystal orientation equipment and proprietary processes. For many of our parts, the cores are then finished through an outsourcing model using trusted partners. 
 We are dedicated to quality assurance throughout our entire operation. We employ detailed material traceability from raw material to finished product. Our quality system is certified as ISO9001:2000. 
 All of our long-lived assets are located in the U.S. and Malaysia. While there are long-lived assets in Malaysia, we are attempting to sell them, as that facility is shut-down and is not an active part of our operations. For more information see Note 2  Segment Information to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
SALES AND MARKETING 
 We market and sell our products through our direct sales force to customers. Our direct sales force includes experienced and technically sophisticated sales professionals and engineers who are knowledgeable in the development, manufacturing and use of sapphire windows and other optical materials. Our sales staff works with customers during all stages of the manufacturing process, from developing the precise composition of the parts through manufacturing and processing the parts to the customers specifications. 
 A key component of our marketing strategy is developing and maintaining strong relationships with our customers. We achieve this by working closely with our customers to optimize our products for their production processes. In addition, we are able to develop long-term relationships with key customers by offering product specification assistance, providing direct access to enable them to evaluate and audit our operations, delivering high-quality products and providing superior customer service. We believe that maintaining close relationships with senior management and providing technical support improves customer satisfaction. 
 In order to increase brand recognition of our products and our Company in general, we publish technical articles, distribute promotional materials and participate in industry trade shows and conferences.

CUSTOMERS 
 Our principal customers have been semiconductor device manufacturers and wafer polishing companies. A substantial portion of our sales have been to a small number of customers. In 2016 our top customer accounted for approximately 60% of our revenue and in 2015, the top two customers accounted for a combined approximately 31% of our revenue. Our revenue from the optical and industrial markets also tends to be concentrated, with three customers accounting for approximately 19%, 13%, and 11% of the optical revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 and four customers accounting for approximately 20%, 14%, 10% and 10% of the optical revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. Although we are attempting to diversify and expand our customer base, we expect our sales to continue to be concentrated among a small number of customers. However, we also expect that our significant customers may change from time to time. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenues during 2016 or 2015. 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
 Our ability to protect our proprietary technologies and other confidential information is a key factor in our ability to compete successfully. We rely primarily upon a combination of patent, trade secret laws and non-disclosure agreements with employees, customers and potential customers to protect our intellectual property. We have seven patents issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark office expiring between 2027 and 2030. In addition, we have twelve pending patent applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and twenty patent applications pending with various other foreign countries. The patents and patent applications mostly cover aspects of our core production, wafer grinding and lapping technologies. However, we believe that factors such as the technological and innovative abilities of our personnel, the success of our ongoing product development efforts and our efforts to maintain trade secret protection are more important than patents in maintaining our competitive position. We pursue the registration of certain of our trademarks in the U.S. and currently have three registered trademarks. 
COMPETITION 
 The markets for high-quality sapphire products are very competitive and have been characterized by rapid technological change. The products we produce must meet certain demanding requirements to succeed in the marketplace. Although we are a well-established sapphire producer, we face significant competition from other established providers of similar products as well as from new and potential entrants into our markets. 
 We have several competitors that compete directly with us. We believe that the key competitive factors in our markets are: 
 

 | consistently producing high-quality products in the desired size, orientation and finish;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | pricing;
--+---------


 | providing a low total cost-of-ownership for customers;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


 | driving innovation through focused research and development efforts;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


 | offering solutions through collaborative efforts with customers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


 | producing large format high-quality crystal for certain applications;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


 | providing U.S.-based source of sapphire for military applications; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 | financial stability of the companies.
--+--------------------------------------

 We believe the developing optical and industrial segments of the market require cost effective high quality sapphire, large diameter sapphire products and ultra-thin double side polished windows and wafers, which we have the capabilities to provide while many other sapphire producers do not. In addition, defense applications often require a U.S. based source for sapphire. We believe we continue to have a reputation for producing the highest quality sapphire in the market. We believe this positions us well with competitive advantages in the markets for optical and industrial sapphire. 
 ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION 
 In our manufacturing process, we use water, oils, slurries, acids, adhesives and other industrial chemicals. We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of these materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. These include statutory and regulatory provisions under which we are responsible for the management of hazardous materials we use and the disposition of hazardous wastes resulting from our manufacturing processes. Failure to comply with such provisions, whether intentional or inadvertent, could result in fines and other liabilities to the government or third parties, injunctions requiring us to suspend or curtail operations or other remedies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The cost of complying with environmental regulation is not material.
