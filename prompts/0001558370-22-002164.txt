Item 1.Business
Overview
​
Tabula Rasa HealthCare, Inc. is a healthcare technology company advancing the safe use of medications by creating solutions designed to empower pharmacists, providers, and patients to optimize medication regimens. Our advanced proprietary technology, MedWise®, identifies the cause of medication-related problems, including adverse drug events (“ADEs”), so healthcare professionals can minimize harm and reduce medication-related risks. Our software and services help improve patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs through reduced hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and healthcare utilization. We also believe we have the most extensive clinical tele-pharmacy network in the United States (“U.S.”), with seven call centers across the country, a number of which are tethered to academic institutions. Health plans and pharmacies nationwide use our solutions to assist them in meeting a range of value-based payment requirements and quality improvement benchmarks. Our vision and mission are supported by our industry-recognized leadership team, our significant investments and collaborations to advance precision pharmacotherapy research and its application in clinical practice, and our culture. 
​
We operate our business through two segments, CareVention HealthCare and MedWise HealthCare. Our CareVention HealthCare segment provides our clients, primarily organizations with Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (“PACE”), with medication fulfillment services, cloud-based software, pharmacy benefit management (“PBM”) solutions, and clinical pharmacist services at the point-of-care. Our MedWise HealthCare segment provides our clients, primarily health plans and retail pharmacies, with cloud-based software and full-service clinical pharmacy programs.
​
CareVention HealthCare
​
CareVention HealthCare primarily services PACE, which is a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) sponsored program providing comprehensive medical and social services to adults age 55 and older who need a nursing facility level of care but can live safely in community settings. Our clients include ArchCare Senior Life, Trinity Health, Palm Beach PACE, St. Paul’s PACE, and Welbe Health. We access the market through a number of different service lines and brands, including CareKinesis®, Capstone Risk Adjustment Services, CareVention Consulting™, PACElogic™, TruChart®, PeakTPA, PersonifilRx®, and Pharmastar®.
​
Our largest CareVention HealthCare revenue offering is our medication fulfillment services, which are built around our novel and proprietary MedWise technology, designed to enable clinicians to increase patient safety, create individualized medication regimens, promote adherence, and eliminate unnecessary prescriptions. Our medication fulfillment and adherence packaging services utilize MedWise technology to reduce medication-related risk for the high-cost, high-risk PACE population. The CareVention HealthCare suite of offerings also includes risk adjustment services, PBM solutions, cloud-based electronic health records solutions, and third-party administration services, which are all specifically tailored to the PACE market. Our CareVention HealthCare segment serves more than 150 healthcare organizations.
​
The CareVention HealthCare segment revenue model is primarily based on payments on a per-member per-month (“PMPM”) basis, payments on a subscription basis, payments on a transaction basis, and payments for charges and dispensing fees for medication fulfillment.
​
MedWise HealthCare
​
Our MedWise HealthCare segment promotes medication safety and adherence to improve patient outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and strengthen patient engagement through our cloud-based software and clinical pharmacist services.
​
 MedWise HealthCare is primarily comprised of service offerings from our acquisitions of the SinfoníaRx business (“SinfoníaRx”) in September 2017 and Prescribe Wellness, LLC (“PrescribeWellness”) in March 2019. As a result of these acquisitions, we believe that we are one of the leading providers of medication therapy management (“MTM”) software and services for Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial health plans, and that we are a leading provider of cloud-based patient engagement software and services for retail pharmacies.

​
Approximately 18,000 retail pharmacies and more than 350 health plans, including several Blue Cross Blue Shield organizations, Express Scripts, Humana, UnitedHealth Group, and WellCare, utilize our MedWise HealthCare solutions to execute a range of clinical programs. These programs support MTM, Medicare quality improvement programs, Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (“HEDIS”) quality measures, and post-hospital discharge care transitions through a combination of our nearly 30,000 PrescribeWellness network pharmacists and/or our clinical tele-pharmacy call centers across the country.
​
The MedWise HealthCare segment revenue model is primarily based payments on a PMPM basis, payments on a subscription basis, and payments on a fee-for-service basis for each clinical intervention, which represents the MedWise HealthCare segment’s largest source of revenue.
​
Industry and Market
​
We believe demographic, legislative, and industry trends support our long-term growth targets. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of Americans age 65 and older, or seniors, is expected to reach 74.1 million by 2030, which will represent more than one in five Americans. An April 2020 report from the Lown Institute noted polypharmacy (defined as the simultaneous use of five or more medications) has reached “epidemic proportions”. The Lown Institute stated that 40% of seniors are taking five or more prescription medications to treat the growing prevalence of multiple chronic conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, asthma, high blood pressure, and cancer.
​
From a legislative perspective, we believe that important drivers supporting our growth are: the long-term transition to value-based care; CMS Medicare Part C and Part D regulations governing Star Ratings; and the changing pharmacy landscape, including the expanding scope and role of community pharmacists as highlighted by new state laws in Idaho, New Mexico, Virginia, and West Virginia, which were enacted in 2020 and recognize pharmacists as providers and allow for reimbursement under Medicare Part B.
​
From an industry perspective, we are addressing a large and growing healthcare problem, which encompasses adverse drug events, or ADEs, compounded by the demographic trends described above. In 2020, 6.3 billion prescriptions were dispensed in the U.S. per IQVIA Institute, an increase of 1.77% from 2019. That year, prescriptions for chronic, persistent conditions accounted for nearly 80% of the total dispensed prescriptions. Also in 2018, an Annals of Pharmacology review estimated the annual cost of prescription-related morbidity and mortality resulting from non-optimized medication therapy at $528.4 billion including 275,689 deaths per year.
​
Our Growth Strategy
​
We continue to progress toward the long-term growth strategy that we had articulated in early 2020. Continued achievement of this long-term growth is based on three key tenets: 
​

1) | Further penetration of the PACE market by leveraging our existing CareVention HealthCare membership base that includes more than 80% of all PACE members utilizing at least one of our solutions and cross-selling to increase our average PMPM fee; organic member growth within our existing clients in part due to: 1) the acceleration of the National PACE Association’s PACE 2.0 initiative designed to significantly increase enrollment to 200,000 by 2028, and 2) the growing influence of for-profit PACE operators; and continued investments in our offerings to attract new PACE members and, more broadly, Medicare Advantage organizations with a focus on dual-eligible beneficiaries.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

2) | Accelerating the adoption of our MedWise software and clinical pharmacy programs by health plans across all lines of business, including Medicare Part C and Part D, Medicaid managed care, and commercial clients with a focus on self-insured employer groups. In addition, we are focused on addressing a broader set of medication-related Star Rating measures as the vast majority of our medication safety services revenue is derived from MTM.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

3) | Increasing the number of pharmacies licensing the entire PrescribeWellness solution set across our growing pharmacy footprint of approximately 15,000 pharmacies nationwide.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To supplement our organic growth, we made a total of seven acquisitions from the beginning of 2018 through 2020, the most recent of which was Personica, LLC, (“Personica”) in October 2020. Our PACE clients had a combined patient census of 49,769 at the end of 2021, as compared to 44,947 and 31,820 patients at the end of 2020 and 2019, respectively.
​
Further Penetrate the Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Older Adult Market
​
We believe we are the market leader in providing medication risk management services to PACE, a CMS-sponsored program through which participating healthcare organizations provide fully integrated healthcare services on an at-risk basis for older adults, most of whom are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. Our medication management plus pharmacy fulfillment PACE clients cover approximately 35% of the total PACE enrollees nationwide at the end of 2021 as compared to 31% at the end of 2020.
​
We have organized our PACE offerings under our CareVention HealthCare segment, which offers comprehensive sets of solutions, including medication management services and fulfillment, PBM solutions, risk adjustment services, third-party administrator services, and electronic health records software. By organizing our sales and marketing resources under our CareVention HealthCare segment, we have streamlined efforts to facilitate cross-selling and increase the adoption of our services. 
 ​
We believe that we have a significant opportunity to continue to grow within the PACE market and we expect our PACE clients to continue to grow organically to cover more eligible lives through expansion of existing sites and new PACE center locations. Based on recent industry data there are 2.2 million PACE-eligible individuals in the U.S., which is less than 3% penetrated. In 2017, the National PACE Association launched PACE 2.0, an initiative designed to facilitate the acceleration of growth in the number of PACE enrollees, or participants. The goal is 100,000 participants by 2024 and 200,000 by 2028. 
​
Continue Expansion into the Payer and At-Risk Provider Markets
​
We believe that the growth of government healthcare programs and the shift to value-based care models are creating opportunities to capture growing portions of the expanding healthcare market. Accordingly, we are actively targeting at-risk, value-based markets, including managed care organizations, physician provider groups, and self-insured employer groups. We have recently started leveraging our CareVention HealthCare portfolio of services to secure contracts with a number of start-up Medicare Advantage plans, and we expect to continue to further penetrate the broader Medicare market with our solutions. 
​
The Enhanced MTM, or EMTM, program was a CMMI Part D pilot that began on January 1, 2017 and ended on December 31, 2021. In September 2021, we announced a peer-reviewed three-part series published in the American Journal of Managed Care validating that medication interventions informed by MedWise clinical decision support tools as part of the EMTM program improve health outcomes and lower healthcare costs. Specifically, the third study as part of this series highlights total healthcare cost savings of $958 per member per year. 
​
Continue to Innovate and Expand Platform Offerings to Meet Evolving Market Needs
​
We believe our strategic investments in human capital, technology, and services position us to continue to pursue rapid innovation and expand our medication risk management solutions and other platform offerings to the broader healthcare marketplace. For example, we developed the MedWise Risk Score™, or MRS, and launched associated high-throughput medication risk stratification technology for identification of patients in need of clinical intervention.
​
Divestiture of Non-Core Assets
​
We are evaluating certain non-core assets to better align our corporate strategy and ultimately increase shareholder value. In February 2022, we commenced an initial plan to sell the DoseMe business, which we had acquired in January 2019. We recently began a search for the appropriate strategic acquirer, and we are continuing to evaluate additional divestiture options to sharpen our focus and drive increased revenue growth and profitability.

Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions
​
Since our founding in 2009, we have successfully completed and integrated eleven acquisitions, which have significantly expanded our market footprint, enhanced our medication risk management offerings, and added valuable complementary services that can be sold into our existing customer base. We plan to continue to acquire assets and businesses and may enter into strategic partnerships that strengthen or expand our service offerings, capabilities and geographic reach and facilitate our entry into new markets. Our acquisition strategy is driven by our commitment to serving client needs, and we continuously assess the market for potential opportunities.
​

● | In 2017, we acquired SinfoníaRx and became a leading provider of MTM services to Medicare Part D plans. We currently service more than 350 health plans and 8.6 million lives across Medicare (Part C and Part D), Medicaid managed care, and the employer market.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In 2019, we acquired PrescribeWellness, a provider of cloud-based patient engagement solutions to retail pharmacy focusing on independent community pharmacies. At the end of 2021, we served approximately 15,000 pharmacies. We believe the pharmacy market is evolving and our customers are looking for new ways to generate revenue beyond prescription fulfillment, especially as pharmacists are granted greater prescriptive authority and provider status.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In 2020, we acquired Personica, a provider of pharmacy services, including 340B and Medicare Part D administration solutions to the PACE market. This addition to our CareVention HealthCare segment increased our pharmacy footprint, added a new set of pharmacy benefit management capabilities, and advanced our pharmacy offering to serve 340B entities, which represent some of the largest PACE programs, and, we believe, strengthens our ability to cross-sell highly complementary solutions.

Clinical Pharmacist Collaboration
​
We have teams of clinical pharmacists dedicated to performing both medication safety reviews, or MSRs, and comprehensive medication reviews, or CMRs. These interventions include one-on-one consultations with patients, as well as communications with prescribers. Clinical pharmacist recommendations can include guidance based on the clinical application of pharmacogenomic test results, assessment of the MedWise findings and of patient medical history, and optimization of medication regimens. Our clinical pharmacists provide these personalized medication recommendations through real-time digital and verbal communications. We provide clinical decision support, medication safety recommendations, and adherence support for patients nationwide.
​
Prescription Fulfillment and Adherence Packaging
​
We operate four prescription fulfillment pharmacies strategically located to efficiently distribute medications nationwide. Informed by each patient’s personalized MedWise Matrix, we package medications, synchronize fills, and aggregate doses by day and time-of-day. These measures increase the ease of adherence by patients to their optimized medication regimens. Using robotic dispensing machines, our scalable, high-performance systems allow for an array of medication packaging options that include multi-dose deep-well cards and multi-dose pouches.
​
Health Plan Management
​
Our health plan management services include risk adjustment services, through our Capstone Risk Adjustment Services offerings, and third-party administration services, through our PeakTPA service offerings.
​
Long-term optimization of risk adjustment outcomes is complex and, for many organizations, significantly affects financial performance. We take a prospective approach to risk adjustment beyond the typical strategy of providing retrospective reviews and claims data analysis. We specialize in helping clients optimize processes and systems to capture timely, complete, and accurate data. Through these services, we help PACE and other healthcare organizations remain compliant with regulations, make reliable comparisons to internal and external benchmarks and identify high-volume/high-cost issues for quality program initiatives.
​
We provide third-party administrator services that optimize health plans’ financial management functions and fulfill regulatory requirements. Our expertise in health plan management, particularly in PACE, enables our clients to focus on delivering high-quality care to their members. Our services include enrollment management, accounts receivable, claims adjudication, risk adjustment data submission, encounter data processing and submission, and Medicare Part D data submission.
​
Pharmacy Benefit Management Solutions
​
We provide PBM solutions to PACE and commercial organizations. These capabilities cover a broad range of administrative and clinical functions, including: claims processing, rebate administration and direct and indirect renumeration (“DIR”) reporting, drug utilization review programs, prescription drug event management, compliance and audit risk, plan-to-plan management, annual Medicare Part D bids, coordination of benefits, true out-of-pocket cost support, and government and state-level reporting.
​
Our Clients
​
Our clients are typically at-risk healthcare organizations, primarily PACE organizations, managed-care organizations, including government and commercial plans, retail pharmacies, and other provider groups. We have strong and long-standing relationships with our clients, in many cases providing services under multi-year contracts. As of December 31, 2021, our largest segment, CareVention HealthCare, served more than 150 healthcare organizations, predominantly PACE organizations. Our MedWise HealthCare segment served more than 350 health plans and approximately 18,000 retail pharmacies, including Walmart retail pharmacy locations across the U.S.
​

PACE Organizations
​
PACE, a federal and state collaboration, is one of only three established models serving the more than 12 million dual-eligible patient population in the U.S. and focuses on preventing institutional-based placement. PACE embodies many of the characteristics and trends affecting the healthcare industry as a whole, specifically value-based payment models and the desire for seniors to age in place. Our proof of concept was to provide medication risk management technology and services to PACE organizations, which are responsible for individuals who typically have complex medication regimens. Since our inception, we believe we have become the market-leader in providing PACE with medication services. Our PACE clients utilizing our medication risk management and pharmacy fulfillment services covered approximately 35% of the total PACE enrollees nationwide at the end of 2021. In addition, we also provide complimentary solutions to assist PACE organizations with operations.
​
Managed Care Organizations
​
According to CMS, at the end of 2021, 51.4 million Americans were enrolled in Medicare Part C (i.e., Medicare Advantage) and Part D (Prescription Drug Plan or PDP), a 3.0% increase as compared to the end of 2020, driven by growth in Medicare Advantage. In the past decade, the number of beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage (“MA”) plans has more than doubled to 27.3 million in 2021. MA enrollment increased 10.1% in 2021 and total enrollment is expected to grow to more than 40 million by 2030. The Congressional Budget Office projects MA to increase to nearly 51% of total Medicare enrollment or more than 80 million Americans by 2030. According to Medicaid.gov, there were 41.9 million adult lives covered under Medicaid as of June 2021, which represents 15.2% growth as compared to the same period a year ago. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 156.2 million Americans or 49% of the country’s total population is covered under employer-sponsored health insurance. Many of the health plans we currently contract with have multiple lines of business spanning Medicare, Medicaid and the self-funded employer market. We currently provide a range of clinical programs, including MTM, medication adherence, opioid management, and medication safety reviews to these markets. We believe our solutions are broadly applicable throughout the managed care landscape, including to self-funded employer groups.
​
At-Risk Provider Groups
​
We contract with at-risk provider groups across the country to provide care transition support and comprehensive medication management services.  We risk-stratify patient cohorts for these groups and identify patients at risk for medication problems. We then collaborate with these groups on interventions to mitigate that risk. These interventions are performed by our clinical teams, or in some cases, by employees of the at-risk provider who we have trained and certified.
​
Intellectual Property
​
We create, own, and maintain various intellectual property assets that, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business. Our intellectual property assets include: six issued patents and nineteen pending patent applications related to our innovations, products, and services; trademarks related to our brands, products, and services; copyrights in software, documentation, content, and databases; and trade secrets relating to data processing, statistical methodologies, data security, and other aspects of our business. We are licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others, and, similarly, other companies are licensed on a nonexclusive basis to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us.
​

11




We rely on patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, licenses, and other agreements with employees, consultants, vendors, and clients.

​
Our Competitive Landscape
​
We compete with a broad and diverse set of businesses spanning both of our major business segments, CareVention HealthCare and MedWise HealthCare. We believe the competitive landscape is highly fragmented with no single competitor offering our novel, multi-drug interaction software and similarly expansive capabilities and solution offerings. Our competitive advantage is largely based on our proprietary multi-drug interaction software, healthcare industry expertise, breadth and depth of services, intellectual property including six patents issued or pending, ease of use, reputation, innovation, security, price, reliability and client service. Our multi-drug interaction software has been developed over the course of three decades, and investments in this domain include the largest pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic laboratory in the Western hemisphere. TRHC has invested more than $100 million in research and development across all technology platforms from 2016 to 2021. A competitive challenge, most notably within our MedWise HealthCare segment, is to demonstrate to our existing and potential clients the value of utilizing our platforms rather than developing or assembling their own alternative capabilities or utilizing providers who offer a subset of our services. However, we believe that the combination of our competitive strengths and successful culture of innovation, including the real-world-tested nature of our solutions and subject matter expertise of our team members, makes it time- and cost-prohibitive for our clients or competitors to replace or replicate all that we offer without facing material risk.
​
Current industry players providing medication risk management service offerings include large and small healthcare data analytics and consulting companies, community and long-term care pharmacies, national pharmacy providers, health plans, genomic testing labs, and healthcare information technology companies. Many of our competitors’ solutions are regulatory-driven, retrospective in nature, and offer no intervention at the point of care. The services offered by these organizations may include e-prescribing and EHRs utilizing antiquated drug interaction analysis, lab-based genomic evaluation, basic risk stratification solutions, and other traditional approaches to MTM. Many health plans attempt to address non-adherence solely through outreach efforts, which often require in-house or third-party consultants and have low success rates. Many genomic testing labs lack the ability to apply patient test results in a useful way at the point of care. Post-acute providers typically employ pharmacist consultants to review prescription 

12




regimens every 30 days, which is retrospective in nature and generally less effective in improving patient outcomes. Furthermore, typical prescription fulfillment models are reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis and are incentivized based on prescription dispensing volumes. Our clients partner with us to mitigate and prevent medication problems, lower healthcare costs, and improve overall health outcomes, which often involves utilizing our software to optimize prescription regimens.
​
While we believe that no competitor provides a similar breadth and dept of solutions, we nevertheless compete with other companies’ specific products or solutions and markets or care settings. For example, traditional, single drug-to-drug interaction databases are provided by Wolters Kluwer, Elsevier, and Hearst Health. Additional competitors across both of our major market segments include our health plan clients that opt to in-source clinical programs (such as MTM), as well as external vendors such as Cardinal Health, Adhere Health, Aspen RxHealth, CSS Health, Pack4U, and MedWatchers. Across the retail pharmacy landscape, we compete with a wide range of public and private companies including Omnicell, RedSail Technologies, and OmniSYS. We expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of consolidation in both the information technology and healthcare industries. The continued growth in healthcare spending, the ongoing shift to value-based payment models, such as PACE and Medicare Advantage, and changes in government regulation may draw increasing attention and generate new competitors, such as management consultants, traditional technology companies, and start-ups that may enter the market.
​
Healthcare Regulatory Environment
​
We operate in a highly regulated industry and our business operations must comply with a number of complex and evolving federal and state agency requirements. While we believe we comply in all material respects with applicable healthcare laws and regulations, these laws can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and the state and federal interpretation of existing laws and regulations, and their enforcement, may change from time to time. Additionally, a state or federal government enforcement body may disagree that we are in material compliance with applicable healthcare laws and regulations. Federal and state legislatures also may enact various legislative proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of our business.
​
There has been no material adverse effect to our consolidated financial statements or competitive positions as a result of these government regulations.
​
A non-exhaustive list of federal and state statutes, regulations, sub-regulatory guidance, and contractual provisions that may apply to our business activities include:
​
Healthcare Legislation
​
In 2010, Congress passed major health reform legislation, mostly through the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”). Generally, the ACA was designed to expand coverage for the uninsured while containing overall healthcare costs. Following passage, the U.S. government has issued numerous rules and regulations to implement the provisions of the ACA. While not all of these rules, regulations, and reforms affect our business directly, many continue to affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by many of our clients.
​
The Biden administration and the United States Congress, which is now controlled by Democrats, are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals that could, if passed into law, impact the healthcare system, the ACA, and/or the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Congress is considering legislation to increase the number of individuals covered by the Medicare or Medicaid programs, reduce prescription drug costs, increase price transparency for consumers, restrict the sale of certain classes of drugs, and reform medication management practices. While not all of the potential legislation, if enacted, would affect our business directly, much of it could directly or indirectly impact some or many of our business arrangements. In addition, regulatory agencies have separately implemented price transparency rules for hospitals and insurers that, while not impacting our business directly, could change the way we interact with these entities. Given that legislative and regulatory change is still being formulated, we cannot predict with any certainty the outcome of any future legislation or regulation. However, we believe that many of the legislative items noted above enjoy bipartisan support.

On October 24, 2018, President Trump signed legislation into law aimed at curbing the opioid crisis in the U.S. The Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act (Pub. L. 115-271), or SUPPORT Act, includes provisions that address law enforcement, public health, and coverage under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Broad in scope, the legislation increases federal oversight of the production and distribution of opioids, bolsters fraud prevention safeguards, enhances oversight of prescription opioids, expands coverage of opioid addiction treatment services, and authorizes consumer education and provider training programs aimed at preventing and treating opioid use disorders. 
​
Given the focus on addressing the opioid epidemic and the federal government’s focus on increasing transparency in drug pricing and oversight, the legislative environment surrounding prescription drugs is in flux. While not all legislative reforms affect our business directly, many continue to affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by many of our clients.
​
On October 10, 2018, two pieces of legislation were enacted to enhance drug price transparency. The Know the Lowest Price Act (Pub. L. 115-262) and the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act (Pub. L. 115-263) each prevent various parties from instituting “gag” orders or clauses against pharmacists and pharmacies, which heretofore may have prevented a pharmacist from disclosing the lowest available price of a drug to a consumer. These laws may have a financial impact on various stakeholders due to pressures to develop more competitive pricing. It is not clear how these changes might affect our business.
​
PACE Organizations
​
Our partnership with PACE organizations is a significant source of our current revenue stream. The PACE program is a unique, comprehensive managed care benefit for older adults, most of whom are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid benefits, provided by a not-for-profit or public entity. The PACE program features a comprehensive medical and social service delivery system using an interdisciplinary team approach in an adult day health center that is supplemented by in-home and referral services in accordance with participants’ needs. Financing for the program is capped, which allows providers to deliver all needed services rather than only those reimbursable under Medicare and Medicaid fee-for-service plans. PACE is a program under Medicare, and states can elect to provide PACE services to Medicaid program beneficiaries as an optional Medicaid benefit. The PACE program becomes the sole source of Medicaid and Medicare benefits for PACE participants.
​
HIPAA Healthcare Fraud Provisions
​
In addition to privacy protections, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) created and expanded federal criminal statutes regarding fraud. Specifically, the HIPAA healthcare fraud statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or to obtain by false or fraudulent pretenses any of the money or property owned by a healthcare benefit program, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, and willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense. The HIPAA healthcare fraud statutes also prohibit, among other things, concealing a material fact or making a materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. The ACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA, like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”), such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Those found to have aided in a violation of these prohibitions are deemed by statute to have committed the offense and are punishable as a principal offender. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (H.R. 1892) enhanced the penalties associated with AKS violations. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) Office of Inspector General, which promulgates rules under the AKS, recently finalized a set of rules as part of the “Regulatory Sprint to Coordinated Care” in 2020. These rules enhance protections for entities that participate in value-based arrangements. It is not yet clear what impact these new rules will have on our business.

State and Federal Data Privacy and Security Laws
​
We process, collect, use, and disclose individual patient data directly or for our clients and, therefore, we are subject to various laws protecting privacy and security of that patient information. Certain segments of our company qualify as a “Covered Entity” under HIPAA, and others qualify as a “Business Associate” to our partners who are Covered Entities. We are required to comply with HIPAA and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (“HITECH”) Act as implemented through regulations promulgated thereunder by HHS, which include the HIPAA Omnibus Final Rule, the HIPAA Privacy Rule and the HIPAA Security Rule. HIPAA generally requires Covered Entities and their Business Associates (each as defined therein) to adopt certain safeguards to ensure the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI, and to limit uses and disclosures of such PHI to those permissible under the law. When Covered Entities utilize Business Associates to provide services, pursuant to which the Business Associate may access the Covered Entity’s PHI, the parties must enter into a Business Associate Agreement through which the Business Associate must contractually agree to safeguard PHI in certain ways and to notify the Covered Entity of improper uses or disclosures of PHI.
​
Covered Entities and Business Associates are required to have written policies and procedures addressing HIPAA compliance and must designate a Security Officer to oversee the development and implementation of the policies and procedures related to the safeguards to protect privacy of electronic PHI. Covered Entities must also designate a Privacy Officer (as defined in HIPAA), although the Privacy Officer and the Security Officer may be the same person. As part of their security policies and procedures, Covered Entities and Business Associates are required to conduct periodic risk assessments to identify vulnerabilities to electronic PHI. Additionally, Covered Entities and Business Associates are required to train all employees on their HIPAA policies and procedures. Further, in the event of a breach of PHI as defined by HIPAA, Covered Entities must notify affected individuals, HHS, and sometimes the media, and must take steps to mitigate damage, and they may be subject to fines and penalties. HIPAA violations can result in significant civil monetary penalties and/or imprisonment for up to ten years depending on the facts surrounding the violation.
​
Many states also have similar data privacy and security laws that track federal requirements or impose different and/or more stringent conditions for use and disclosure of PHI. Failure to comply with these laws may also result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or the CCPA, imposes rules governing how businesses handle personal data of California residents. Companies that do business in California are, as of January 1, 2020, required to disclose the types of data they collect, the purpose for the data collection, how the data will be used, as well as expand organizational responsibilities pertaining to individual rights, accountability, and governance. In November 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act of 2020 (“CPRA”). While the CPRA will not take effect until January 1, 2023, it expands the CCPA and establishes a California regulatory agency dedicated to enforcing data privacy compliance requirements. Other states are considering legislation similar to the CCPA and the CPRA, which could expand our data protection obligations.
​
Federal and State Oversight of Medical Devices, Genomic Testing, Drugs, and Controlled Substances 
​
Some technologies and software applications used in connection with healthcare analytics and genomic testing and analysis are considered medical devices and are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA. The 21st Century Cures Act (Pub. L. 114-255), enacted in December 2016, included certain changes to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to exempt certain medical-related software from FDA regulation. In December 2017, the FDA issued a draft guidance document describing the FDA’s proposed interpretation of the exemption under the 21st Century Cures Act for clinical decision support, or CDS, software. The FDA issued a revised draft of this CDS software guidance document in September 2019, which included proposed policies of enforcement discretion for certain types of CDS software that do not fully meet the exemption criteria under the 21st Century Cures Act. Although we believe that our technologies and software are not subject to active FDA regulation, there is a risk that the FDA could disagree. There is also a risk that the FDA could finalize its guidance for CDS software in such a way that it excludes our software and technologies from the scope of the CDS software exemption under the 21st Century Cures Act. If the FDA determines that any of our current or future services, technologies or software applications are regulated by the FDA as medical devices, we would become subject to various statutes, regulations, and policies enforced by the FDA and other governmental authorities, including both pre-market and post-market requirements, and we would need to ensure that the affected services, technologies, and/or software comply with such requirements. The FDA could also require that we cease marketing and/or recall the affected services, technologies, and software unless and until they comply with the FDA’s requirements.

​
The FDA also regulates COVID-19–related drugs and medical devices, including COVID-19 tests, and generally requires emergency use authorization (“EUA”) or other premarket approval for such products. We market and sell certain COVID-19 tests authorized by the FDA. Our marketing, sale, and distribution of COVID-19 tests is subject to the requirements and restrictions imposed by the FDA in the EUA approval letters for such tests, as well as the state laws and regulations governing prescription devices and clinical tests.
​
Clinical laboratories that perform human genomic testing are subject to oversight by CMS and state regulators.  The laboratories that we contract with for genomic testing must comply with federal and state laws and regulations applicable to clinical laboratories and genomic testing, including the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments and the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018 (“EKRA”).
​
The Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), the FDA, and state regulators, such as state boards of pharmacy, regulate drug and controlled substance packaging, repackaging, purchasing, handling, storage, distribution, security, and dispensing activities. Our prescription fulfillment pharmacies must comply with the applicable FDA, DEA, and state statutes, regulations, and policies. In addition, our prescription fulfillment pharmacies may be subject to periodic audits by state regulators, the DEA, and/or the FDA to assess our compliance with these requirements. 
​
Non-compliance with applicable federal or state requirements, as described above, can result in an enforcement action that could substantially harm our business.
​
Anti-Kickback Laws
​
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, or AKS makes it unlawful for individuals or entities, among other things, to knowingly and willfully solicit, offer, receive, or pay any kickback, bribe or other remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce or reward the referral of an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program, or the purchase, lease, or order, or arranging for or recommending purchasing, leasing or ordering, of any good, facility, service, or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment, and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (H.R. 1892) enhanced the penalties associated with AKS violations. The HHS Office of Inspector General, which promulgates rules under the AKS, recently finalized a set of rules as part of the “Regulatory Sprint to Coordinated Care” In 2020. These rules enhance protections for entities that participate in value-based arrangements. It is not yet clear what impact these new rules will have on our business.
​
The federal AKS is an intent-based statute, but following the amendment from the ACA, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Further, the failure of an arrangement to satisfy all elements of an AKS safe harbor will not necessarily make it illegal, but it may subject that arrangement to increased scrutiny by enforcement authorities. The federal AKS is applicable to us as operators of specialty pharmacies, contractors to health plans and providers, and contractors to various federal healthcare program payers. When our compensation arrangements implicate the AKS, we evaluate whether we believe they fall within one of the safe harbors. If not, we consider the factors to identify the intent behind such arrangements and the relative risk of fraud and abuse. We also design business models that seek to reduce the risk that any such arrangements might be viewed as abusive and trigger AKS scrutiny or claims.
​
In addition to the federal AKS, many states have anti-kickback prohibitions that may apply to arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payers.

Federal and State Self-Referral Laws
​
The federal physician self-referral law, often referred to as the Stark Law, with limited exceptions, prohibits physicians from referring Medicare Program or Medicaid patients to an entity for the provision of certain designated health services, among them outpatient prescription medications, if the physician or a member of such physician’s immediate family has a direct or indirect financial relationship (including an ownership or investment interest or a compensation arrangement) with the entity. The Stark Law also prohibits the entity from billing Medicare or Medicaid for such designated health services. A referral that does not fall within a statutory exception is strictly prohibited by the Stark Law. A violation of the Stark Law is punishable by civil sanctions, including overpayment liability, significant fines and exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs. CMS, which promulgates rules under and enforces the Stark Law, recently finalized a set of rules as part of the “Regulatory Sprint to Coordinated Care.” These rules enhance protections for entities that participate in value-based arrangements. It is not yet clear what impact these new rules will have on our business.
​
We evaluate when these physician (or immediate family member) financial arrangements are created to ensure we do not enter into a prohibited financial relationship and design structures that satisfy exceptions under the Stark Law.
​
Our business may implicate federal and state physician self-referral laws to the extent our pharmacy, a designated health services entity, has financial arrangements in the form of ownership, investment or compensation with referring physicians or a referring physician’s immediate family member. Our pharmacy may have compensation arrangements with physicians who serve on its Clinical Advisory Panel and who order designated health services for patients enrolled in a PACE program. If any such compensation arrangements exist, we believe such compensation arrangements fall within an exception to the physician self-referral prohibition.
​
A number of states have statutes and regulations that prohibit the same general types of conduct as those prohibited by the Stark Law, but some have even broader applications, extending beyond Medicare and Medicaid programs and including commercial and self-payers.
​
Federal and State False Claims Acts
​
The federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act, impose criminal and civil liability on individuals and entities that, among other things, knowingly submit, or cause to be submitted, false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government or knowingly make, or cause to be made, a false statement in order to have a false claim paid. The civil False Claims Act provides for treble damages and mandatory and significant minimum penalties per false claim or statement ($11,803 to $23,607 per false claim). The qui tam or whistleblower provisions of the civil False Claims Act permit a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. Our future activities relating to the manner in which we sell and market our services may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. False Claims Act qui tam lawsuits in healthcare are common, although the government often declines to pursue such actions following investigation. Analogous state false claims laws also may apply to our sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payers.
​
Other State Laws
​
The vast majority of, if not all, states have laws regulating licensure, registration and certification of pharmacies, pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, other pharmacy personnel, and health insurance administrators. We are licensed in all states that require such licensure in which we do business and believe that we substantially comply with all state licensing laws applicable to our business. Where required by law, we also have pharmacists licensed in all states in which we dispense. If we violate state pharmacy licensure laws or engage in conduct prohibited under our license, we could be subject to enforcement action, including but not limited to suspension or loss of such pharmacy license.
​
The DEA, as well as some similar state agencies, requires our pharmacy locations to individually register in order to handle controlled substances, including prescription pharmaceuticals. Federal and various state laws also regulate specific labeling, reporting, and record-keeping related to controlled substances. We maintain DEA registrations for each of our facilities that require such registration and follow procedures intended to comply with all applicable federal and state requirements regarding dispensing controlled substances.
