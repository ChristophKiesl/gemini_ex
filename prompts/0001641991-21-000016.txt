Such statements may address our plans, our strategies, our prospects, or changes and trends in our business and the markets in which we operate under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”) or in other sections of this document. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “could,” “would,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “project,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of those terms or similar expressions. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially because of market conditions in our industries or other factors, and forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results. In addition, management’s estimates of future operating results are based on our current complement of businesses, which is subject to change as management selects strategic markets.
All the forward-looking statements in this document are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed in this document, including under the heading “Risk Factors” and in any documents incorporated by reference herein that describe risks and factors that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. We caution you that these risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment and frequently enter into new businesses and product lines. We cannot predict these new risk factors, and we cannot assess the impact, if any, of these new risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. We undertake no obligation to update or publicly revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date of this document.
BUSINESS
Our Business
SPX FLOW, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (“SPX FLOW,” ‘‘the Company,’’ “we,” “us,” or “our”) operate in two business segments. Based in Charlotte, North Carolina, SPX FLOW innovates with customers to help feed and enhance the world by designing, delivering and servicing high-value process solutions at the heart of growing and sustaining our diverse communities. The product offering of the Company's continuing operations is concentrated in process technologies that perform mixing, blending, fluid handling, separation, thermal heat transfer and other activities that are integral to processes performed across a wide variety of sanitary and industrial markets. In 2020, SPX FLOW had approximately $1.4 billion in annual revenues, with approximately 36%, 37%, and 27% from sales into the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific regions, respectively, and has continuing operations in more than 30 countries and sales in more than 140 countries.
Our product portfolio of pumps, valves, mixers, filters, air dryers, hydraulic tools, homogenizers, separators and heat exchangers, along with the related aftermarket parts and services, supports global industries, including food and beverage, chemical processing, compressed air and mining. From an end-market perspective, in 2020, approximately 47% of our revenues were from sales into the food and beverage end markets and approximately 53% were from sales into the industrial end markets. Our core strengths include expertise in rotating, actuating and hydraulic equipment, a highly skilled workforce, global capabilities, product breadth, and a deep application knowledge that enables us to optimize configuration and create custom-engineered solutions for diverse processes.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
As further discussed in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" (or "MD&A") below, the novel coronavirus pandemic ("COVID-19" or "COVID-19 pandemic") had an adverse 
impact on our consolidated financial results for the year ended December 31, 2020. These adverse impacts began in the first quarter of 2020, continued through the fourth quarter of 2020, and are expected to continue in 2021, but we are unable to determine the extent, duration, or nature of further impacts at this time. Although certain of our product lines (e.g., shorter-cycle product lines within our Industrial reportable segment) have been impacted more than others in our portfolio, we believe that our diverse set of products, along with our strong balance sheet position and available liquidity, position us well to mitigate further potential adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, because we serve customers which produce food, beverages, personal care items, cleaning products, pharmaceuticals, and specialty chemicals, and serve critical infrastructure and industrial enablement functions, a majority, but not all, of our products, services and operations have been classified as “essential” under various governmental orders restricting business activities implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. While we temporarily closed certain of our offices and engineering, service and manufacturing centers during 2020, and may be required to close additional facilities in the future in response to governmental orders, other COVID-19 pandemic safety-related concerns or in response to market conditions affected by COVID-19, our manufacturing facilities have not experienced significant interruptions in operations to date.
In terms of liquidity, as of December 31, 2020, we had over $440 of cash and equivalents on hand and, as discussed in Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, approximately $490 of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities. As noted below, we received net proceeds of approximately $401.1 from the sale of our discontinued operations during 2020. On August 15, 2020 we redeemed our $300.0 aggregate principal amount 5.625% senior notes, as discussed further in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements, and there are no debt repayments due under other primary debt obligations until June 2022. We also have taken actions to manage near-term costs and cash flows, including reducing discretionary spending, and will continue to assess the actual and expected impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and any requirements for further actions.
REPORTABLE SEGMENTS
Our continuing operations are organized into two reportable segments — the Food and Beverage segment and the Industrial segment. The following summary describes the products and services offered by our reportable segments:
Food and Beverage:  The Food and Beverage reportable segment operates in a regulated, global industry with customers who demand highly engineered, process solutions. Key demand drivers include dairy consumption, emerging market capacity expansion, sustainability and productivity initiatives, customer product innovation and food safety. Key products for the segment include homogenizers, pumps, valves, separators and heat exchangers. We also design and assemble process systems that integrate many of these products for our customers. Key brands include APV, Gerstenberg Schroeder, Seital and Waukesha Cherry-Burrell. The segment's primary competitors are Alfa Laval AB, Fristam Pumps, GEA Group AG, Krones AG, Südmo, Tetra Pak International S.A. and various regional companies.
Industrial: The Industrial reportable segment primarily serves customers in the chemical, air treatment, mining, pharmaceutical, marine, infrastructure construction, general industrial and water treatment industries. Key demand drivers of this segment are tied to macroeconomic conditions and growth in the respective end markets we serve. Key products for the segment are air dryers, filtration equipment, mixers, pumps, hydraulic technologies and heat exchangers. Key brands include Airpel, APV, Bolting Systems, Bran+Luebbe, Deltech, Hankison, Jemaco, Johnson Pump, LIGHTNIN, POSI LOCK, Power Team and Stone. The segment's primary competitors are Alfa Laval AB, Chemineer Inc., EKATO, Enerpac, IDEX Viking Pump, KSB AG, Lewa, Milton Roy, Parker Domnick Hunter, Prominent and various regional companies. 
Divestitures
We periodically review and negotiate potential divestitures in the ordinary course of business, some of which are or may be material. As a result of this continuous review, we initiated a process in 2019 to divest a substantial portion of our former Power and Energy reportable segment, excluding the Bran+Luebbe product line (collectively, the “Disposal Group”). In connection with this initiative, we narrowed our strategic focus by separating our process solutions technologies, comprised of our Food and Beverage and our Industrial reportable segments, plus the Bran+Luebbe product line, from our flow control application technologies, comprised of the Disposal Group. Given the specific capabilities that are unique to each category of technologies and businesses, our further intent was that each business would, through a process of separation, be positioned to improve its respective service to customers through the narrowing of such strategic focus.
In connection with the May 2019 announcement and the continued development of the divestiture process thereafter, we reported the Disposal Group as “held-for-sale”, and as discontinued operations, initially as of the end of our second quarter of 2019. As the operations and organizational structure of the remaining business of the former Power and Energy segment (primarily the Bran+Luebbe product line as noted above) have been absorbed into the Industrial reportable segment, 
and the operating results of the Industrial reportable segment (now including the Bran+Luebbe product line) are regularly reviewed by the Company’s chief operating decision maker, we have reclassified the results of that remaining business into the Industrial reportable segment. The results of operations, cash flows, and assets and liabilities of our discontinued operations and our Industrial segment, for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, reflect this presentation.
In November 2019, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Sale Agreement”) with an affiliate of Apollo Global Management, LLC (the “Buyer”), pursuant to which we agreed, indirectly through certain of our subsidiaries, to sell the Disposal Group to the Buyer for a gross purchase price of $475.0 (the “Transaction”). The gross purchase price of $475.0 was subject to (i) reductions based upon the level of certain deductions of the Disposal Group at the closing date, and (ii) certain adjustments based upon the level of net working capital, cash and debt of the Disposal Group at the closing date. The deductions include, for example, components of the Contract Liabilities and certain other current and long-term liabilities of the Disposal Group, as well as deductions for budgeted but un-incurred capital expenditures and other business infrastructure costs measured over periods defined in the Sale Agreement, but in all cases which expired at the closing date. 
On March 30, 2020, we completed the sale of substantially all Disposal Group businesses and received proceeds from the Buyer of $406.2, based on an estimate of certain adjustments to the gross purchase price as of the closing date and as discussed further above and, to a lesser extent, certain fees. During the fourth quarter of 2020 and upon receiving relevant regulatory approvals, we completed the sale of the remaining net assets of the Disposal Group, based in India, to the Buyer for total proceeds of $6.3. Considering proceeds received from the Buyer of $406.2 in the second quarter of 2020, net of cash and restricted cash of $7.3 included in the net assets of the Disposal Group which were sold at that time, proceeds of $6.3 received related to consummation of the sale of the India business less cash paid of $4.1 for a net working capital settlement during the fourth quarter of 2020, cash flows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, reflect net proceeds of $401.1 from disposition of the Disposal Group.
See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the divestiture process, as well as further details regarding the results, major classes of assets and liabilities, and significant non-cash operating items and capital expenditures of discontinued operations. See also Note 4 for information regarding a less significant disposal of a business in the Industrial reportable segment, based in our Asia Pacific region, which occurred during the fourth quarter of 2020.
Unless otherwise indicated, amounts reported in Part I of this Form 10-K pertain to continuing operations only.
Acquisitions
As part of our long-term strategy, we plan to evaluate potential acquisitions that (a) are complementary to our existing products and services, (b) increase our relevance to customers and our capabilities to serve them, (c) expand our global capabilities and accelerate our localization strategy and (d) expand our end market reach.
On August 1, 2020, we completed the acquisition of POSI LOCK, Inc ("POSI LOCK"), a manufacturer of hydraulic and mechanical pullers used to remove certain parts from equipment in a variety of industries ranging from power transmission and light to heavy industrial applications. We purchased substantially all of the assets, including net working capital, long-term and intangible assets, and assumed certain liabilities of the business, for a cash payment of $10.0. The pro forma effects of the acquisition of POSI LOCK are not material to our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
On January 18, 2021, the Company completed the purchase of approximately 98% of the issued and outstanding shares of Plc Uutechnic Group Oyj ("UTG Mixing Group"), a public company, listed on the Nasdaq Helsinki, for approximately $41.0. The Company has initiated a squeeze-out process prescribed by Finnish law pursuant to which the Company will (a) acquire the remaining outstanding shares in UTG Mixing Group and (b) delist the shares of UTG Mixing Group from the Nasdaq Helsinki. UTG Mixing Group is the maker of Stelzer, Uutechnic, and Jamix mixing solutions for the chemical, food, metallurgical and fertilizer, environmental technology, water treatment and pharmaceuticals markets. The addition of UTG Mixing Group's operations, based in Finland and Germany, adds technology, manufacturing capacity and technical expertise to SPX FLOW's global portfolio of mixing and blending solutions and will be included in the Industrial reportable segment. 
Research and Development
We are engaged in research and development programs designed to improve existing products and manufacturing methods and to develop new products to better serve our current and future customers. We place particular emphasis on the development of new products that are compatible with, and build upon, our manufacturing and marketing capabilities.
Intellectual Property
We own approximately 139 domestic and 314 foreign patents, including 25 patents that were issued in n 2020, covering a variety of our products and manufacturing methods. We also own a number of registered trademarks. Although in the aggregate our patents and trademarks are of considerable importance in the operation of our business, we do not consider any single patent or trademark to be of such importance that its absence would adversely affect our ability to conduct business as presently constituted. We are both a licensor and licensee of patents. For more information, please refer to “Risk Factors—Our technology is important to our success, and failure to develop new products may result in a significant competitive disadvantage.”
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 4,800 employees in 34 countries. While none of our approximately 1,400 U.S. employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement, certain of our non-U.S. employee groups are covered by various collective labor arrangements. While we generally have experienced satisfactory labor relations, we are subject to potential collective labor campaigns, work stoppages, collective labor negotiations and other potential labor disputes. 
Our “Focus on People and Culture” initiative prioritizes ensuring the safety of our employees, fostering a culture of belonging, supporting open communication channels with our team members, surveying employee engagement and giving back to the communities in which we live.
We seek employees who share our commitment to hard work, ingenuity and doing what it takes to best serve our customers. Our priorities are to provide competitive compensation and benefits packages, support the ongoing personal and professional development of our employees and provide a safe and inclusive work environment.
We also prioritize the importance of diversity, equity and inclusion through initiatives undertaken to increase diversity (through recruitment and hiring), equity (through investments in targeted development programs and flexible work options) and inclusion (through employee resource groups and inclusive management). 
As part of our oversight with respect to our human capital resources, our Board of Directors periodically receives reports from management regarding the status of our Strategic People and Culture Plan, which focuses on three critical themes: 
•Building Growth Capabilities—through supporting and enabling our Growth Teams to drive profitable growth; 
•Building Leadership—through improving manager effectiveness and promoting internal talent for critical roles; and 
•Building Belonging—through improved engagement survey results and diversity representation in people leadership roles.
Our compensation programs are market-driven and performance-based, allowing us to recognize and reward employees who display the values and leadership practices we embrace. In addition to offering competitive compensation packages (including salary, incentive bonus and stock compensation), we also provide a benefits package that provides employees with options in managing their well-being (including health insurance, paid time off, an employee assistance program, paid parental leave and retirement savings plans).
We offer a work environment with opportunities for personal development, challenges, career growth and recognition. Through our development and career growth programs, employees have opportunities to enhance skills, develop competencies and pursue career goals. 
Raw Materials
We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, including steel, titanium, nickel and petroleum-based products. Where appropriate, we may enter into long-term supply arrangements or fixed-cost contracts to lower the overall cost of raw materials. In addition, due to our diverse product and service offering, as well as the wide geographic dispersion of our production facilities, we use numerous sources for the raw materials needed in our operations. However, we are not dependent on any one supplier or a limited number of suppliers. Lastly, we continue to centralize certain aspects of supply 
chain management in an effort to ensure adequate materials are available for production at low cost. For more information, please refer to “Risk Factors—The price and availability of raw materials may adversely affect our business.”
Competition
The markets we serve are highly competitive and fragmented. Our competitors are diverse, ranging from large multi-nationals to regional and local companies. Our principal global competitors include Alfa Laval AB, GEA Group AG, IDEX Corporation, and Tetra Pak International S.A. We do not have any one competitor with all the same product offerings, nor do we have any one competitor which serves all the same end markets. 
Our ability to compete effectively depends on a variety of factors including breadth of product offering, product quality, engineering strength, brand reputation, lead times, global capabilities, service capabilities, and cost. As many of our products are sold through distributors and independent representatives, our success also depends on building and partnering with a strong channel network. 
Backlog
Information with respect to the backlog of the Company's segments at December 31, 2020 is presented in “MD&A—Results of Reportable Segments.”
Environmental Matters
See “MD&A—Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates—Contingent Liabilities,” “Risk Factors—We are subject to laws, regulations and potential liability relating to claims, complaints and proceedings, including those relating to environmental and other matters” and Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding environmental matters. 
Executive Officers 
See Part III, Item 10 of this report for information about our executive officers. 
Other Matters 
No customer or group of customers that, to our knowledge, are under common control, accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for any of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. 
Our businesses maintain sufficient levels of working capital to support customer requirements, particularly inventory. We believe our businesses' sales and payment terms are generally similar to those of our competitors. 
The financial results of many of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries and end markets they serve. In addition, certain of our businesses have seasonal fluctuations. In aggregate, our businesses tend to be stronger in the second half of the calendar year. Additionally, timing of revenue recognition on large Food and Beverage systems projects and large Industrial original equipment orders may cause significant fluctuations in financial performance from period to period.
