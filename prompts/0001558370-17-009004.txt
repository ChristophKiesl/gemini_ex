 Item 1.    Business
 Overview
 We are a leading global provider of automation and cryogenic solutions for multiple applications and markets. We primarily serve the semiconductor capital equipment market and sample management market for life sciences. We believe our leadership position and global support structure in these markets makes us a valued business partner to the largest semiconductor capital equipment and device makers and pharmaceutical and life science research institutions in the world. Our offerings are also applied to industrial capital equipment and other adjacent technology markets. We are headquartered in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, employ approximately 1,660 full-time employees worldwide, have sales in more than 50 countries, and provide customer support services globally.
 Since 1978, we have been a leading partner to the global semiconductor manufacturing markets. In our early days, we developed and marketed automated handling equipment for semiconductor manufacturers. Since then, we have expanded our products and services through product development initiatives and acquisitions, and we are now recognized as a leading provider of vacuum robots, vacuum automation systems, wafer carrier contamination control systems, and cryogenic vacuum solutions to the global semiconductor capital equipment industry. In recent years we have made several key acquisitions, including certain integrated handling system assets of Crossing Automation, Inc. acquired in fiscal year 2013, the automated contamination cleaning equipment of Dynamic Micro Systems Semiconductor Equipment GmbH in fiscal year 2014 and Contact Co., Ltd. in fiscal year 2015. We have invested in research and development initiatives to advance the offerings from each of these acquisitions, as well as our offerings of vacuum automation and cryogenic products and services. In fiscal year 2014 we divested out Granville-Phillips

Instruments business. Our business supporting the semiconductor capital equipment and adjacent markets provided approximately 79% of our revenue in fiscal year 2017.
 We entered the life sciences sample management market in 2011.  We believed this market was underserved and that we could leverage our core competencies of automation and cryogenics to simultaneously diversify our business into a market that provides us the potential for higher growth and margin expansion. Our strategic objective was to provide offerings to assist customers in managing the “cold chain of custody” of their compound and biological samples, including storage, work flow solutions, transportation, handling, informatics and services.  Today we are a leading provider of the life sciences sample management solutions for automation infrastructure, storage services, infrastructure services, and consumables and instruments. We have also recently commercialized software offerings which enable or enhance our customers’ visibility into their sample management inventories, which in turn is expected to increase the customers’ speed to market.  Taken together, we believe these offerings allow our customers to maintain a complete “cold chain of custody” for their samples. Our business supporting the life science sample management market provided approximately 21% of our revenue in fiscal year 2017.
 Our portfolio of product and service solutions is a result of strategic acquisitions, as well as internal research and product development initiatives over the past several years. We acquired three providers of large automated ultra-cold storage freezers and bench-top instruments for sample management: RTS Life Sciences and Nexus BioSystems, Inc., both of which were completed in fiscal year 2011, as well as Matrical, Inc. completed in fiscal year 2013. In fiscal year 2013, we launched an improved, internally-designed, automated freezer system successfully combined large automated systems into our single Twinbank platform, which we now manufacture in Manchester, United Kingdom. Market research led to our development of the BioStoreTM III Cryo offering, a smaller, automated, liquid nitrogen-cooled freezer that operates at -150°C, which we began to sell in 2016. The Twinbank and BioStore III Cryo systems are our core automated infrastructure offerings.  
 In November of 2015, we acquired BioStorage Technologies, Inc., a full-service outsourcing sample management business, which gave us the capability to support customers with an integrated, comprehensive set of sample management products, services and solutions. In July 2017, we acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Pacific Bio-Material Management, Inc. and Novare, LLC, two companies that provide storage, transportation, management, and cold chain logistics of biological materials. These acquisitions are expected to expand our existing capabilities with respect to sample management and integrated cold chain storage and transportation solutions.
 In October 2014, we acquired FluidX Ltd., a consumable sample tube and bench-top instruments business, and in November 2016 we acquired Cool Lab, LLC, a subsidiary of BioCision, LLC, a provider of a range of cryogenic product solutions that assist in managing the temperature stability of therapeutics, biological samples and related biomaterials in ultra-cold environments. We held an equity interest in BioCision prior to the acquisition of Cool Lab and collaborated in the development of advanced solutions in temperature controlled environments. We have made several investments in developing new consumable and instrument offerings since the acquisitions of FluidX and Cool Lab. Subsequent to September 30, 2017, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of 4titude Limited, a U.K.-based manufacturer of scientific consumables for biological sample materials used in a variety of genomic and DNA analytical applications. The acquisition is expected to expand our existing offerings of consumables and instruments within the Brooks Life Science Systems segment.
 In fiscal year 2017, we launched BioStudies, a bioinformatics software platform that enables customers to manage their global sample collections. In August 2017, we acquired certain assets and liabilities related to FreezerPro®, a web-based software platform from RURO, Inc., which provides sample management software across multiple end markets, including academic research, government, pharmaceutical, biotech, and healthcare. We expect this acquisition to complement our BioStudies offerings and extend our informatics solutions to address laboratories, biobanks or other enterprises that manage biological samples. 
 As discussed above, we have made acquisitions over the years which accelerated our product development cycle, broadened our installed base and added customer relationships to our business. We have also divested certain of our products that were not in leadership positions in our core markets. As such, we use acquisitions and divestitures to strengthen our portfolio and achieve increased growth and profitability. For further information on our acquisitions and equity investments, please refer to Note 3, "Acquisitions," and Note 7, "Equity Method and Other Investments," to our

Consolidated Financial Statements included under "Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10‑K.
 The demand for semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment is cyclical, resulting in periodic expansions and contractions of this market. While the services element of our semiconductor business is generally more stable, the cyclical nature of the capital equipment business causes sales from products to vary quarterly based on short term market demands. It is not unusual for these variations in sales to be up or down 10% to 20% in sequential quarters. We believe the life science sample management market is generally more stable than the semiconductor capital equipment market and expected to grow more quickly than our semiconductor business as a result of the expanding need for storage and retention of compound and biological samples. However, even in this market, revenue streams from storage services can be more stable than the sale of freezers and other equipment, which exhibit periods of robust growth but also decline. As we have expanded our offerings of consumables, infrastructure services and storage services, we have seen these more stable revenue streams in life sciences increase to account for approximately 53% of our Brooks Life Science Systems segment revenue in fiscal year 2017. Segments
 We have two operating and reportable segments consisting of (i) Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment and (ii) Brooks Life Science Systems segment. Prior to fiscal year 2016, we had three operating and reportable segments that consisted of Brooks Product Solutions segment, Brooks Global Services segment and Brooks Life Science Systems segment. During fiscal year 2016, we reorganized our reporting structure into two operating and reportable segments. For further information on our operating segments and the related restructuring actions, please refer to Note 15, "Restructuring and Other Charges" and Note 18, "Segment and Geographic Information," to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under "Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10‑K.

a) | Markets and Customers
---+----------------------

  The principal markets served by the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment include the following:

· | Semiconductor capital equipment market
--+---------------------------------------

  Each year, the global semiconductor industry makes significant capital investments in equipment to keep up with advancements in semiconductor technology, to add manufacturing capacity and to improve productivity within existing semiconductor fabrication plants, or fabs. We are recognized as a market leader in four critical sub-segments: vacuum automation for wafer handling; cryogenic vacuum pumps; contamination control; and automation for advanced packaging. As discussed above, the global semiconductor capital equipment industry is cyclical, but we believe that it possesses a long-term growth profile driven by the demand for increasingly sophisticated consumer electronics, automotive and smart appliance products, growth in data centers, the expansion of Internet-of-Things which increasingly connects various appliances and devices to servers, and mobile platforms. The demand for higher performance, lower power consumption and reduced size for all such products is enabled by advancements in the technology and processes used for the manufacturing of the devices. We believe this trend continues to provide market opportunities for the 

 
  5

 
Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group to be a valued partner in providing vacuum automation, carrier contamination control, cryogenic solutions and automation for advanced packaging to support the industry’s needs.
 We have been a long-term partner to device manufacturers, or fabs, and the original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, who are the providers of complex processing equipment, or tools, to fabs. We maintain collaborative relationships with our customers for the innovative design of solutions that enable our customers to have a valued wafer process advantage and improved cost of ownership in the fab. Our global network of technical specialists provides extensive support to our customers in all regions, including the key semiconductor markets in Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and China.
 The production of advanced semiconductor chips requires many complex and logistically challenging manufacturing activities. Silicon wafers must go through hundreds of process steps in order to create billions of microscopic transistors and connect them in both horizontal and vertical layers to produce a functioning integrated circuit, or IC. These steps, which comprise the initial fabrication of the IC and referred to in the industry as front-end processes, are repeated many times on a single wafer to create the desired pattern on the silicon wafer. Up to 50% of these processes are performed in tools that operate under vacuum conditions, such as removing, depositing, or measuring materials on wafer surfaces. As the complexity of semiconductors has increased, the number of process steps that occur in a vacuum environment have also increased, resulting in a greater need for both automation and vacuum technology solutions.
 The increase in packing density of components in mobile devices has led the industry to devise new techniques for chip interconnectivity using what is called wafer level packaging, or WLP. This advanced packaging technology is a process of combining multiple wafers together prior to cutting them into pieces and then forming them onto a packaging substrate where they are ultimately divided into the multitude of chips. The recent increased adoption of WLP has increased the need for a contaminant free and high purity manufacturing environment, which is providing new demand across our semiconductor offerings which are tailored to handle full wafer forms expanding our opportunity with existing and new customers. For example, throughout the fabrication and packaging processes noted above, the demand for clean processing extends to increased demand for wafer carrier devices which are used for the safe and clean transport of wafers between tools during the manufacturing process. Large scale semiconductor fabs may use thousands of these carriers. There is also growing demand for wafer carrier cleaning and conditioning tools used to remove microscopic particles, organic compounds and water that are attracted to the inside surface of the carrier. Automated cleaning and conditioning of the carrier devices are also in demand by customers looking to improve yields.

· | Adjacent capital equipment markets
--+-----------------------------------

  In addition to the semiconductor manufacturing industry, there are a variety of adjacent and industrial manufacturing operations that use similar manufacturing processes. Frequently, these markets have common customers and similar technology applications. A few of the adjacent markets which we serve include light-emitting diodes, or LED, which are manufactured using vacuum systems and handling processes similar to those used in semiconductor manufacturing. Organic Light Emitting Diode, or OLED, applications are also gaining traction in the mobile computing and telecommunications device markets because of their high quality display and low power consumption. Touch screen technology found in mobile devices requires either a vacuum or significant cooling for effective deposition of films or coatings during the production process.
 We believe the desire for efficient, higher throughput and extremely clean manufacturing for semiconductor wafer fabs, the chip packaging process and other industrial or high performance electronic-based products and processes have created a substantial market for us in the following offerings: (i) substrate handling automation, which is related to moving the wafers in a semiconductor fab, (ii) tool automation, which is related to using robots and modules in conjunction with and inside process tools that move wafers from station-to-station, (iii) vacuum systems technology to create and sustain the clean environment necessary for fabricating various products, and (iv) automated contamination control systems to condition and clean wafer carriers.

 Product and Service Offerings
 The principal offerings of the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment consist of: (i) wafer handling robotics and systems, (ii) semiconductor contamination control solutions, and (iii) cryogenic pumps and compressors. The segment also provides support services, including repair, diagnostic and installation, as well as spare parts and productivity enhancement upgrades to maximize tool productivity.
 Wafer handling robotics and systems offerings- include vacuum robots and atmospheric robotic modules, as well as tool automation systems that provide precision handling and clean wafer environments. In the semiconductor industry, wafer handling robotics have emerged as a critical technology in the highly complex production tools in the world’s most advanced wafer fabs. A typical customer tool is designed and built around a process chamber and uses automation technology to move wafers in and out of the chamber. We specialize in developing and building the automated handling systems, as well as the vacuum technologies used in these tools. We provide individual components within an OEM customer system as well as complete integrated handling systems. We provide automation products that are used for both atmospheric pressure and vacuum-based tools and are designed to improve performance and productivity of the manufacturing process.
 Contamination control solutions- include automated cleaning and inspection systems for wafer carriers, as well as reticle pod cleaners and stockers, which are automated systems that store wafers or reticles. Our products use enhanced technology to remove critical airborne contamination within the workflow of the manufacturing process. Our solutions contribute to improving yields, productivity and process stability in the manufacturing process which requires an ultra-clean manufacturing environment.
 Cryogenic pumps and compressors- provide vacuum pump and thermal management solutions that are used in critical vacuum process applications. Certain process steps require our vacuum pumps to create and optimize the process environment by maintaining pressure consistency throughout the manufacturing process. Semiconductor manufacturers need to ensure that each process operates at carefully controlled pressure levels to achieve optimal production yields. Impurities or incorrect pressure levels can lower production yields, thereby significantly increasing manufacturing costs. Our cryogenic vacuum pumps are considered the industry standard by many leading semiconductor device manufacturers for ion implant and physical vapor deposition, or PVD, applications, both of which require high vacuum pumping capability.
 Within the semiconductor industry, we sell our products and services to the world’s major semiconductor chip and OEMs. Our customers outside the semiconductor industry are broadly diversified. We have major customers in North America, Europe and Asia.
