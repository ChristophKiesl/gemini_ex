ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Our Company
Welbilt, Inc. ("Welbilt", the "Company", "we", "us" "our") was incorporated in Delaware in 2015 and became publicly traded in March 2016 after a spin-off from The Manitowoc Company, Inc. ("MTW"). Welbilt is one of the world's leading commercial foodservice equipment companies leveraging a full suite of equipment capable of storing, cooking, holding, displaying, dispensing and serving in both hot and cold foodservice categories. We are headquartered in New Port Richey, Florida, and operate 20 manufacturing facilities globally.
We design, manufacture and supply best-in-class equipment for the global commercial foodservice market which are used by commercial and institutional foodservice operators including full-service restaurants, quick-service restaurant ("QSR") chains, hotels, resorts, cruise ships, caterers, supermarkets, convenience stores, hospitals, schools and other institutions. We sell our products through a global network of over 5,000 distributors, dealers, buying groups and manufacturers' representatives (individually and collectively, "channel partners"). 
Our portfolio of award-winning brands includes Cleveland™, Convotherm®, Crem®, Delfield®, Frymaster®, Garland®, Kolpak®, Lincoln™, Manitowoc® Ice, Merco®, Merrychef® and Multiplex®. These product brands are supported by three service brands: KitchenCare®, our aftermarket parts and service brand, FitKitchen®, our fully-integrated kitchen systems brand and KitchenConnect®, our cloud-based application brand. Through these brands, we provide our customers with a full portfolio of product platforms and solutions that are specific to meet our customers' needs, drive brand loyalty and maintain high customer satisfaction. With our in-house culinary staff and skilled engineers, we are able to develop innovative solutions and tailor our product offerings to meet our customers’ evolving menu choices and strategic plans, which serves to further strengthen our relationships. 
We intend to achieve sustainable growth globally and drive increased profitability by leveraging our position as a leading commercial foodservice equipment provider, while selectively pursuing strategic acquisitions and partnerships, growing our customer base, expanding the frontiers of foodservice innovation and continuing to attract and grow industry-leading talent. We continue to explore acquisition opportunities that complement our product lines, allow us to expand our presence in international markets, enable us to leverage our distribution capabilities, provide us with selective technologies and/or otherwise support the expansion of our business in a manner that is consistent with our strategic goals. 
Our History
Our heritage in the commercial foodservice equipment industry stretches back over a century. In 1929, Henry and Alexander Hirsch established the Welbilt Stove Co., which acquired foodservice equipment companies like Garland and Cleveland that had a history dating as far back as the mid-1800s. Our business has grown through strategic and transformational acquisitions of brands that have been integrated to become a foodservice equipment company offering an end-to-end product solution for commercial kitchens. We have also grown organically with expansion of these acquired brands through our long-standing customer relationships that have spanned decades. Coupled with our focus on research and development, innovation, and superior customer service, we have become an industry-leading provider of commercial foodservice equipment. 
In October 2008, our former parent, MTW, completed the acquisition of Enodis plc, a global leader in equipment manufacturing for the foodservice industry, for $2.7 billion. With this acquisition, our portfolio expanded to include refrigeration, ice-making, cooking, food preparation, and beverage-dispensing technologies.
In January 2015, MTW announced plans to create two independent, public companies to separately operate its two businesses: its crane business and its foodservice business. On March 4, 2016, we spun off from MTW and publicly listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the name Manitowoc Foodservice, Inc. Effective March 6, 2017, we renamed the Company to Welbilt, Inc. and rebranded our logo and brand identity to Welbilt as part of our strategic repositioning and long-standing commitment to put customers’ needs first.
In April 2018, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Avaj International Holding AB, whose wholly owned subsidiary, Crem International Holding AB ("Crem") develops, manufactures and markets a full suite of commercial coffee machines for use in offices, restaurants, cafes and coffee shops, catering and convenience stores, for $220.3 million. This acquisition provided us with an established presence in hot beverage equipment, a complementary product category, the potential for operational synergies and cross-selling benefits as well as an increased presence in Europe and Asia.

Key milestones in our history are depicted below. 
Our Markets
Our global footprint positions us to capitalize on growth in both developed and emerging markets, as our full-line of hot and cold foodservice products, systems and services are sold in more than 100 countries. We manage our business in three geographic business segments: Americas, EMEA and APAC. The Americas segment includes the United States ("U.S."), Canada and Latin America. The EMEA segment consists of markets in Europe, including Middle East, Africa, Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States. The APAC segment consists primarily of markets in China, India, Australia, South Korea, Singapore, Philippines, Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong, Taiwan, New Zealand and Vietnam. 
Based on consolidated net sales by destination for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $1,593.9 million, approximately 38% of our consolidated net sales were generated outside the U.S. During such period, the majority of our revenue was derived from customers within the Americas at approximately 69%, 19% from EMEA customers and 12% from APAC customers, after giving effect to the elimination of intersegment sales. As a result of our customer base and distribution network being well balanced, none of our direct customers, which include channel partners as well as large chain accounts, represented 10% or more of Welbilt consolidated net sales for any of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. 
Our broad portfolio of foodservice products, systems and services provides us with a balanced, diverse revenue base. Net sales by product class are as follows:

(in millions) | | December 31,
 | 2019 | | 2018 | 2017 
Commercial foodservice equipment | | $ | 1,335.8 | | $ | 1,329.0 | | $ | 1,173.3
Aftermarket parts and support | | 258.1 | | 261.1 | | | 272.1
Total | | $ | 1,593.9 | | $ | 1,590.1 | | $ | 1,445.4

Commercial foodservice equipment includes revenues generated from both cold and hot category equipment. For each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, approximately 40-45% of our total consolidated revenues were generated from the sale of hot category equipment, 35-40% of our total consolidated revenues were generated from the sale of cold category equipment and approximately 15-20% of our total consolidated revenues were generated from the sale of aftermarket parts and services.

Strategic Objectives
Based on our vision to become the global leader in professional foodservice equipment, systems and services, we have the following strategic objectives:
Achieve profitable growth
We intend to grow sales organically with our best-in-class foodservice equipment product portfolio and kitchen systems approach. While organic growth across all three of our regions is our first priority, we will selectively pursue strategic acquisitions and partnerships. Our industry is fragmented, and we believe there is significant opportunity for consolidation through acquisitions, partnerships and other strategic relationships to drive growth.
Selected initiatives supporting this strategic objective include:

• | Product branding and value proposition: We believe that leveraging our individual brand identities allows us to better differentiate ourselves through customer preference enabling deeper customer relationships and in turn produces a competitive advantage. Our customer insight at the brand level enables us to innovate quickly and bring category leading products to market in order to capture sales in higher growth segments.


• | Breadth and Go-to-Market approach: Our goal is to improve each customer's experience by effectively going to market as a portfolio of brands offering end-to-end foodservice equipment solutions, thus making it easier for customers to do business with us. Our breadth of product line and global scale allows us to pursue multi-product solutions for a given channel which increases our customer loyalty.


• | Identify potential targets for acquisitions and strategic partnerships: We seek to identify, analyze and assess potential targets for acquisitions and partnerships to establish a presence in new markets, supplement our current product offerings or acquire technologies that can be leveraged in our existing product portfolio.

Create innovative products and solutions 
To remain an industry leader and grow our reputation as an innovative company, we continuously develop dynamic product and system solutions for the entire kitchen. We leverage our suppliers and customers to actively address product competitiveness and life cycle extensions. We co-create innovation and refresh existing products with new, locally relevant food-inspiring technologies, while simultaneously finding new ways to integrate those technologies into global platforms in a cost-effective manner and create cohesive kitchen systems for our customers.
Selected initiatives supporting this strategic objective include:

• | Digital solutions and KitchenConnect: We are increasingly bringing touch screen and other controls technologies to our products. These technologies have significant operator benefits and web connectivity for our customers, supporting the integration of equipment into KitchenConnect, which is our cloud-based application that provides customers with necessary visibility and insight into the operating efficiency of the kitchen. By extracting the data from Welbilt kitchen equipment and pushing it to our KitchenConnect system, customers may more effectively operate their kitchens resulting in cost savings and improved food quality, among other benefits. We believe our digital connectivity capabilities and KitchenConnect technology strengthens our product offerings and enhances overall value to our customers.


• | FitKitchen: With our FitKitchen methodology, we take a holistic approach to design and develop integrated kitchen solutions to meet each customer’s individual needs, including equipment requirements, size constraints and customer experience goals. We use a multi-phase approach to clearly identify and understand our customers’ goals and objectives, conduct extensive research and analysis, and develop prototypes for testing and further refinement. This customer-focused process leads to new kitchen platforms, product introductions and long-term customer relationships, thereby providing recurring product sales and sustainable growth opportunities.

Enhance customer satisfaction
We believe our broad product portfolio and the positioning of our industry-leading brands enables us to further grow the number of customers we serve and improve overall customer satisfaction as a trusted provider to the largest companies in the foodservice industry.
Selected initiatives supporting this strategic objective include:

• | Customer-centric product development and planning: Placing the customer in the center of our new product developments and solutions while improving operations and reducing costs across the entire value chain to better serve our customers. Our longstanding relationships with our customers allow us to work in partnership to develop cooking solutions that meet their menu change, quality, or labor efficiency initiatives.

--


• | KitchenCare parts and service: Grow our parts and service business to capture a larger market share and further integrate the full solutions offering to our customers to support reduced operator downtime thereby increasing profitability.

Drive operational excellence
We are focused on productivity gains and cost reductions across our business and plan to continue to leverage our global footprint to drive greater efficiencies across our operations. We are executing these cost reduction initiatives through our Business Transformation Program ("Transformation Program"), which was launched in the second quarter of 2019. The Transformation Program is structured in multiple phases extending through 2021 and is focused on specific areas of opportunity including strategic sourcing, manufacturing facility workflow redesign, distribution and administrative process efficiencies and optimizing our global brand platforms. 
Selected initiatives supporting this strategic objective include:

• | Global sourcing initiative: Ensure that suppliers are able to provide parts to us at competitive cost and lead times. We have initiated the establishment of a procurement center of excellence that leverages our global scale, manages critical vendors and deploys best practices, while developing stronger brand-based procurement capabilities at each facility.


• | Facility rationalization and lean manufacturing: Reduce excess capacity in our network of global manufacturing facilities, implement lean principles in all operations and incorporate production systems that embed continuous improvement into the culture of our manufacturing processes.


• | Quality excellence: Ensure that we deliver high quality products by prioritizing quality and supply chain excellence in all aspects of production, from new product introduction to global manufacturing.


• | 80/20 portfolio rationalization: Focus the most resources and investments in developing the products that yield the greatest returns ("such that 80% of the sales come from 20% of the portfolio").

Develop great people
We strive to make Welbilt an employer of choice in our industry. We believe that we demonstrate a strong commitment to our people by providing a diverse and inclusive culture and environment where employee input, efforts and achievements are recognized and valued.
Selected current initiatives supporting this strategic objective include:

• | Talent and succession program: Focused development through tailored programs for our top talent with key succession planning identified through a robust talent assessment process.


• | Rewards strategy: A total rewards program that recognizes outstanding employee achievements and measurable results in leadership, individual and organizational performance, innovation, and positive culture change that support the values and strategic goals of the business and attracts as well as retains talent.


• | Diversity and inclusion: A diversity and inclusion strategy that recognizes and builds awareness of diversity, leading to a work environment in which all individuals are treated fairly and respectfully, have equal access to opportunities and resources and can engage and contribute fully to our organization’s success.

Key Success Factors
Breadth and complementarity of industry leading brands. We offer a complementary portfolio of hot and cold commercial foodservice equipment integrated under one company that is supported by KitchenCare, our aftermarket parts and service brand, FitKitchen, our fully-integrated kitchen systems brand and KitchenConnect, our cloud based-application brand. Our hot and cold commercial foodservice equipment and capabilities span storing, cooking, holding and displaying and dispensing and serving technologies. The breadth of our portfolio allows us to meet the needs of entire commercial kitchens and serve the world’s growing demand for food prepared away from home.

Integration of food, equipment, digital technologies and people. In our research and development efforts, we combine our expertise in industrial engineering and culinary sciences to continuously optimize both the functionality and ease of operation of our foodservice equipment products. This leads to the creation of innovative kitchens with optimized workflow, energy and labor savings and more comfortable workspaces. 
Seamless customer experience. We are dedicated to putting the customer experience first. Throughout the life cycle of each product, we strive to provide customers with a consistent and seamless experience. We design custom kitchen environments based on the unique operational needs of each customer. We regularly partner with our customers to further develop the equipment, systems and technologies that customers use to serve their specific culinary needs and enable their success by delivering tailored solutions. 
Global scale through our network. The scale and breadth of our worldwide network, which includes our channel partners combined with our distribution centers, enables us to consistently deliver our products to our customers as they expand globally, even in fast-growing emerging markets. We have extensive manufacturing, sales, and customer service networks with 47 locations in 17 countries. We have the scale to serve the largest global customers and the local market expertise to leverage our international presence. Our footprint enables us to manufacture our products as close as possible to intended end markets and apply our developed markets expertise in emerging markets.

Intellectual Property
Intellectual property, including certain patents, trademarks, copyrights, know-how, trade secrets and other proprietary rights, is important to our business. We hold numerous patents pertaining to our products and have presently pending applications for additional patents in the United States and various foreign countries. In addition, we have various registered and unregistered trademarks and licenses that are of material importance to our business and we believe our ownership of this intellectual property is adequately protected in customary fashions under applicable laws. Although certain proprietary intellectual property rights are important to our success, we do not believe we are materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses.
Our worldwide intellectual property portfolio provides: global protection of our research and development efforts and product development investments; recognizable competitive distinctions and proprietary advantages; brand support and enhancement; and leverage for value creation opportunities such as licenses. We take efforts to protect, enforce and defend our intellectual property and proprietary rights, as appropriate.
--

Regulatory Environment
We actively work with U.S. and foreign-based standards organizations, industry associations, certification parties, and regulatory bodies to develop and promote effective and balanced standards, codes, and regulations that provide for the advancement of sustainable customer solutions, with the highest possible levels of energy efficiency, sanitation, environmental standards, safety, and food quality. For example, we are active members of the North American Association of Food Equipment Manufacturers, the Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute, the Underwriters Laboratories task group, the National Sanitation Foundation's International Joint Committee, the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, various working groups responsible for European safety standards in Europe, the Industrial Association for House, Heating and Kitchen Technology, and other regional standards organizations. We fully engage with the U.S. Department of Energy on new energy standards, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on ENERGY STAR programs and the Significant New Alternatives Policy program related to alternative refrigerant regulations, as well as the European Union's ("EU") Ecodesign directive consultant organizations.
Backlog
Due to our diverse products and services portfolio and the relatively short period between order and shipment dates on most products, we believe that our backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects.
Seasonality
Typically, the first quarter of our fiscal year represents the least favorable period for our financial results while the third quarter of our fiscal year typically is the most favorable. Our customers are primarily located in the northern hemisphere, where the warmer summer weather generally leads to an increase in construction and remodeling within the foodservice industry. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we employed approximately 5,100 people worldwide which includes workforce resources from seven employee unions in North America, two trade unions and a local works council in Europe and three trade unions in China. 
Raw Materials
We support our region-of-use production strategy with corresponding region-of-use supplier partners where appropriate. The primary raw materials that we use in the manufacturing of our products are rolled steel, aluminum, and copper, which are generally available in adequate quantities from numerous suppliers. We strive to maintain alternative sources of supplies and materials when possible, but some material parts and key components we use in the manufacturing of our products are obtained from sole sources of supply. We believe that our relationships with our suppliers are good and we consider our current sources of supply to be adequate for our present and anticipated future requirements.
