OVERVIEW
General
Barnes & Noble Education, Inc. (“BNED”) is one of the largest contract operators of physical and virtual bookstores for college and university campuses, and private/parochial K-12 schools, across the United States, and a leading provider of digital education services. Through our Barnes & Noble College (“BNC”) and MBS Textbook Exchange (“MBS”) subsidiaries, we operate 1,481 physical and virtual bookstores and serve more than 6 million students enrolled in higher education institutions and K-12 schools.
Effective with the acquisition of MBS on February 27, 2017, we have determined that we operate two reportable segments: BNC and MBS. See the BNC and MBS segment discussions below.
BNC operates 769 physical campus bookstores, the majority of which also have school-branded e-commerce sites operated by BNC, and BNC also includes our digital operations. Our campus stores are a social and academic hub through which students can access affordable course materials and affinity products, including new and used print and digital textbooks, which are available for sale or rent; emblematic apparel and gifts; trade books; computer products; school and dorm supplies; café offerings; convenience food and beverages; and graduation products. BNC product offerings also include a suite of digital content, software, and services through our LoudCloud platform, such as predictive analytics, a variety of courseware built on a foundation of open educational resources ("OER"), and competency-based learning solutions.
Our MBS subsidiary operates two highly integrated businesses. The MBS Direct business is the largest contract operator of virtual bookstores for college and university campuses, and private/parochial K-12 schools. MBS Direct operates 712 virtual bookstores, offering new and used print and digital textbooks, which are available for sale or rent. Additionally, MBS Direct sells textbooks directly to students through textbooks.comSM, one of the largest e-commerce sites for new and used textbooks. MBS Wholesale is one of the largest textbook wholesalers in the country, providing a comprehensive selection of new and used textbooks at a low cost of supply to more than 3,700 physical bookstores, including BNC’s 769 campus bookstores.
Educational institutions increasingly are outsourcing bookstore operations, investing in data-driven analytical tools, and offering students more affordable options for textbooks and other learning tools. Given these continuing trends, we are well-positioned to capture new market share and partner with an increasing number of schools across the country. As demand for new, improved, and more affordable products and services increase in the rapidly changing education landscape, we are working to evolve our business model and enhance our solutions. We aim to be an even stronger partner for schools and meet customer needs by expanding our physical and virtual bookstore service capabilities, courseware offerings and digital platform services. We believe that our recent strategic actions, including the acquisition of LoudCloud, Promoversity and MBS, and development of courseware, have substantially enhanced our competitive position. We continue to aggressively innovate and collaborate with our partners to provide solutions that extend well beyond course materials sourcing and sales to include new digital services that support successful student outcomes.
Strength of Our Business
We believe our product offerings and services for students, faculty and administrators enable a more personalized learning experience, which improves student success rates and retention. We strive to be the first stop for students, educators and administrators by offering the most comprehensive resources available with our flexible physical and/or virtual bookstore options. The strengths of our business are as follows:

Index to Form 10-K Index to FS


• | Large Footprint with Well-Recognized Brand: We operate 1,481 physical and virtual bookstores and serve more than 6 million students enrolled in higher education institutions and K-12 schools. The Barnes & Noble brand is virtually synonymous with bookselling, and we believe it is one of the most widely recognized and respected brands in the United States. Our large Barnes & Noble College footprint, reputation, and credibility in the marketplace not only support our marketing efforts to universities, students and faculty, but are also important for leading publishers who rely on us as one of their primary distribution channels. The addition of MBS’s wholesale and virtual bookstore customers meaningfully expanded our customer base, and MBS Direct’s advanced virtual bookstore capabilities increased our footprint to include higher education institutions and K-12 schools that prefer virtual bookstore solutions, enabling us to offer existing and prospective clients physical, virtual and hybrid bookstore models.


• | Ability to Meet Students’ Affordability Needs: We are dedicated to providing quality, cost-effective course materials and are constantly seeking new ways to deliver the most affordable and easily accessible materials possible. We offer a comprehensive range of cost-effective options for textbooks (new and used, for rent or for sale), as well as programs that help students to secure the best price, such as our “price match” program. The MBS Wholesale distribution channel, warehousing systems and fulfillment expertise allow us to provide an expanded selection of new and used textbooks. Our digital courseware utilizing open educational resources (“OER”), defined as any type of educational materials that are available to a learning community at little or no cost, is a cost-effective solution for today’s educators, providing course materials at a significantly lower cost to students.


• | Comprehensive Suite of Course Materials: Our physical bookstores and accompanying e-commerce sites offer new and used print and digital textbooks, which are available to buy or rent. Through our MBS Wholesale business, we have a robust inventory comprised of approximately 300,000 textbook titles in stock and a comprehensive catalog of new and used textbooks and digital course material solutions. We offer alternative forms of educational materials, including digital courseware built on a foundation of OER, so that students and educators have the flexibility to learn and teach in digital and/or print formats.


• | Well-Established, Deep Relationships with Partners: We have strong partnerships with college and university administrators, as well as with publishers, vendors and suppliers.


• | Our Barnes & Noble College campus bookstores have an average relationship tenure of 15 years. Our BNC decentralized management structure empowers local teams to make decisions based on the local campus needs and foster collaborative working relationships with our partners.


• | We have long-term relationships with over 10,000 publishers, who can partner with us to access one of the largest distribution networks of college and K-12 educational materials in the United States.


• | MBS has developed deep relationships with its wholesale customer base as a result of its substantial inventory of used textbooks, a comprehensive catalog of textbooks, superior service and systems support. MBS Wholesale provides inventory management, hardware and point-of-sale software to approximately 477 college bookstores.


• | Direct Access to Students and Faculty: We have excellent visibility into the needs of our customers. At our physical campus stores, we serve as social hubs for over 5 million students and their faculty, allowing us to forge deep customer relationships and seamlessly integrate their systems with our technology. For our MBS Direct and Wholesale businesses, we are connected with our customers’ students online and through our proprietary systems. Our multi-channel strategies focus on building close relationships and one-to-one connections with our students, faculty, administrators and alumni, whether in-store, online or mobile. We provide connectivity to our services whether our customers are in the classroom, at the stadium, or at orientation. Our Student Point of View (POV) panel gains insights from more than 8,000 college students, and allows us to adjust our offerings to better meet expressed needs. Through this unique relationship with students, we also operate as a media channel that drives revenue through brands looking to target the college demographic.


• | Integrated Systems with Our Customers: We are deeply ingrained in the course material adoption processes of our customers. Both BNC and MBC have highly integrated online systems that streamline the adoption process for faculty, enabling them to research, update, approve and submit textbook adoptions online, as well as make informed decisions on adoptions as the application gives real-time information regarding title availability, edition status and price.


• | Stable, Long-Term Contracts: BNC physical bookstores are operated under management contracts with colleges and universities that are typically for five year terms with renewal options, but can range from one to 15 years, and are typically cancelable by either party without penalty with 90 to 120 days' notice. From Fiscal 2014 through Fiscal 2017, 94% of these contracts were renewed or extended, often before their termination dates. Virtual bookstores offered through MBS Direct operate under a contract with the school as the exclusive seller of course materials. Over the past three years, we have retained more than 95% of our contracts, with the majority of the contracts being automatically renewed as per the contract terms or renewed before their expiration dates without going through a formal bid process.

• | Seasoned Management Team: Both BNC and MBS possess experienced senior management teams with proven track records, and demonstrated expertise in bookstore outsourcing, virtual bookstore operations, wholesale distribution and fulfillment operations, content distribution, marketing and retail operations, and in scaling digital educational and other digital products and services. 

Growth Drivers
The primary factors that we expect will enable us to grow our business are as follows:

• | Increasing Market Share with New Accounts: New store openings are an important driver of growth. In Fiscal 2017, BNC signed 38 new stores for estimated first year annual sales of $118 million. Currently, approximately 52% of college and university affiliated physical bookstores in the United States are operated by their respective institutions. Based on the anticipated continuing trend towards outsourcing in the campus bookstore market, we intend to aggressively pursue these opportunities to grow BNC’s core business. Additionally, our acquisition of MBS expands our addressable market to include K-12 and higher education schools that prefer virtual bookstore solutions. MBS Direct signed 80 new accounts in Fiscal 2017 for $17 million of estimated annual sales. Our ability to offer existing and prospective clients physical, virtual and hybrid bookstore models is a key element of our competitive strategy. We believe that our message of affordability and convenience will continue to gain traction and allow us to capture market share by offering flexible physical and virtual bookstores options, as well as digital solutions.


• | Scalable and Advanced Digital Solutions: We leverage our digital technology platform to provide product and service offerings designed to address the most pressing issues in higher education, such as affordable and accessible course materials, retention solutions driven by our analytics platform, and products designed to drive and improve student outcomes. Through our LoudCloud platform, we address the growing demand for alternative forms of educational materials and learning tools. By focusing on advanced OER courseware, we plan to continue to enhance and grow our digital content and services in an efficient, low-cost/high-value manner to complement our printed textbook businesses. Additionally, we believe that our predictive analytics solution has strong benefits for higher education institutions, and therefore potentially strong demand characteristics in this emerging space. Our recently announced partnership with Unizin underscores the value proposition of our predictive analytics solutions in helping client institutions improve student success rates and retention. 


• | Expanding Strategic Opportunities through Acquisitions and Partnerships: We intend to pursue strategic relationships with companies that enhance our educational services or distribution platform, or create compelling content offerings. Our acquisitions and partnerships this fiscal year helped us expand into new educational verticals and markets, such as workforce and skills gap training and K-12, but other markets for expansion remain, including international markets. These will continue to be opportunistically evaluated.

Segments
Effective with the acquisition of MBS on February 27, 2017, we have determined that we operate two reportable segments: BNC and MBS. We identified our segments based on the way our business is managed (focusing on the financial information distributed) and the manner in which our chief operating decision maker allocates resources and assesses financial performance.
BARNES & NOBLE COLLEGE
General
As of April 29, 2017, BNC operates 769 physical campus bookstores, the majority of which also have school-branded e-commerce sites operated by BNC, and BNC also includes our digital operations. During Fiscal 2017, we opened 38 stores with estimated first year annual sales of $118 million, and closed 20 stores, primarily comprised of satellite store locations that we elected to close and we continue to operate the main contract, contracts with low sales volume, as well as those contracts that may have been lost in a competitive bid process. As of June 16, 2017, BNC has signed additional contracts for 23 new physical stores with estimated first year annual sales of $50 million, which we expect to open during our Fiscal 2018.
Contracts
Our BNC stores are typically operated under management agreements with the college or university to be the official university bookstore and the exclusive seller of course materials and supplies, including physical and digital products sold in-store, online or through learning management systems. We offer existing and prospective clients physical, virtual and hybrid bookstore models. Agreements are typically five years with renewal options, but can range from one to 15 years, and are typically cancelable by either party without penalty with 90 to 120 days' notice. We pay the school a percentage of sales for the right to be the official college or university bookstore and the use of the premises; more than half of our agreements do not have any minimum guaranteed amount to be paid to our partners. In addition, we have the non-exclusive right to sell all items typically sold in a college bookstore both in-store and online. We also have the ability to integrate our systems with the university’s systems in order to accept student financial aid, university debit cards and other forms of payment. We obtain student and faculty email lists for direct communication which provide for seamless integration into the university community and potential co-branded marketing opportunities.

Product and Service Offerings
Our campus stores are a social and academic hub through which students can access affordable course materials and affinity products, including new and used print and digital textbooks, which are available for sale or rent; emblematic apparel and gifts; trade books; computer products; school and dorm supplies; café offerings; convenience food and beverages; and graduation products. BNC product offerings also include a suite of digital content, software, and services through our LoudCloud platform, such as learning analytics, a variety of courseware developed utilizing OER, and competency-based learning solutions, which allow students to advance in a course based on their ability to master a skill or competency at their own pace.
BNC’s full suite of product offerings include:

• | Course Material Sales and Rentals: Sales and rentals of print textbooks are a core revenue driver. Our online platform and registration solutions (discussed below) are deeply ingrained in our partner schools’ textbook selection process.We work directly with faculty to ensure the textbooks they have chosen for their courses are available in all required formats before the start of classes. MBS’s wholesale distribution channel enables us to optimize our textbook sourcing, purchasing and liquidation processes, and we are able to more efficiently source and distribute a comprehensive inventory of affordable course materials to customers with the highest and greatest need. On average, MBS Wholesale has approximately 300,000 textbook titles in stock at any given time to support the course offerings of our partner schools.


• | OER Courseware: In Fall 2016, we launched OER courseware, a turnkey solution for colleges and universities, within our existing physical bookstore footprint and beyond, which offers advanced, affordable learning materials built on a high-quality foundation of OER and enhanced with content such as videos and self-assessments. Our high-quality OER courseware significantly reduces course material costs for students and enables easier implementation for faculty, all with the objective of ultimately improving learning outcomes. Our courseware is delivered digitally on our LoudCloud platform, with analytics integrated into the solution, and companion print versions available to students and educators who prefer the flexibility to learn and teach in either format. Courseware offerings include general education courses, including sociology, psychology and economics, which were piloted in 2016 at institutions such as the Pennsylvania State University, Cuyahoga Community College and West Liberty State College.


• | eTextbooks: We have partnered with VitalSource, a global leader in building, enhancing and delivering digital content, on our digital reading platform and a broad digital catalog.

Our stores feature collegiate and athletic apparel, other custom-branded school spirit products, technology, supplies and convenience items. We continue to see significant year over year growth in our e-commerce sales and in the demand for our True Spirit fan sites, which are dedicated virtual stores that appeal specifically to the alumni and sports fanbase. As of April 29, 2017, we operate 61 True Spirit sites. Additionally, in June 2016, we enhanced our merchandise offering through the acquisition of Promoversity, a custom merchandise supplier and e-commerce storefront solution serving the collegiate bookstore business and its customers. This acquisition provides us with a wide customer base outside of the BNC footprint, as Promoversity’s standalone e-commerce solution can serve any school, corporation or group looking for customized apparel, corporate gifts and novelties, and merchandise. 


• | Cafes and Convenience Stores: We operate 83 customized cafés, featuring Starbucks Coffee®, and 17 stand-alone convenience stores, as well as diverse grab-and-go options including organic, vegan, gluten-free and ethnic fare for students. These offerings increase traffic and time spent in our physical stores.

Instructure is a leading LMS provider at schools across the country, and we believe the ability to integrate with a school’s Canvas system makes our analytics solution more efficient and effective.


◦ | We entered into an agreement with Unizin, Ltd. ("Unizin") in May 2017 to provide its 22 member universities with LoudSight. As a result, faculty and advisors will have access to a customized solution that helps educators identify, monitor, and support at-risk students, with the goal of improving student success rates and retention.


• | Career Now: Our Career Now initiative provides early career preparation for students through personal brand building workshops, faculty resource guides, career prep podcasts and dedicated content through The College Juice, our student blog. We also help build a stronger connection between students and campus resources, including career fairs, mentors, career sponsors and other career services. These career preparatory programs help students achieve their post-graduation goals, which supports our campus partners’ recruitment and retention goals. 

Merchandising and Supply Chain Management
Our purchasing procedures vary by product type (i.e. textbooks, general merchandise or trade books). Purchases are made at the store level based on the relationships our managers have with the faculty, with strategic corporate oversight, while maintaining appropriate inventory levels.
After titles are adopted for an upcoming term, we determine how much inventory we will need to purchase based on several factors, including student enrollment and the previous term’s textbook sales history. We use our automated sourcing systems to determine if our stores have the necessary new or used books on hand and may transfer the inventory to the appropriate store. MBS has historically been one of our largest suppliers of new and used books, and our acquisition of MBS significantly increased our textbook supply at competitive prices. MBS’s broad wholesale distribution channel and warehousing systems also drive inventory efficiencies, allowing us to optimize our textbook sourcing, purchasing and liquidation processes.
After internal sourcing, we purchase books from outside suppliers. As part of our contracts with institutions, we guarantee that we will order textbooks for all courses. Our primary suppliers of new textbooks include Pearson Education, Cengage Learning, McGraw-Hill, MPS, and John Wiley & Sons. Our primary suppliers of used textbooks are students, through returns of previously rented and purchased books. The stores offer a "Cash for Books" program in which students can sell their books back to the store at the end of the semester, typically in December and May. Students typically receive 50% of the price they originally paid for the book if it has been adopted for a future class or the current wholesale price if it has not. Both unsold textbooks and trade books are generally returnable to publishers for full credit. For textbook sales and rentals, we utilize our sophisticated inventory management platforms to manage pricing and inventory across all our stores.
The larger stores feature an expanded selection of trade (general reading) books and use the Barnes & Noble, Inc. Book Master system, a proprietary merchandising system licensed from Barnes & Noble, Inc. Our merchants meet with publishers on a regular basis to identify new titles and trends to support this changing business. In the smaller stores, trade book purchasing is controlled at the store level.
General merchandise vendors and products are initially selected by our merchants using the analytics and insights from our planning and allocation systems. This data is used to establish benchmarks across school type, region and the socio-economics of each of our partner institution’s student base to help local store management team forecast sales and trends.

assortments are provided to the stores, and stores then make selections based on the perceived needs of each campus, reaching back out to the home office merchants with their recommendations on any additional campus specific needs.
Omnichannel Retailer and Customer Marketing Strategies
We operate bookstores in our dynamic, multichannel format virtually and on campuses of state universities, private universities and community colleges of various sizes. Our omnichannel strategies focus on building close relationships and one-to-one connections where our customers need us to be - in-store, online, mobile, at the stadium, at orientation, or wherever they are.
Students, Parents, Alumni
We have flexible research channels that help us stay ahead of the rapidly changing needs and behaviors of our customers, and proactively respond with dynamic solutions. Our Student Point of View (POV) panel gains insights from more than 8,000 college students, and helps us to create the ideal customer experience.
Our marketing efforts are centered around an active digital community of over 6.6 million people, which includes engaged email subscribers and continuous dialogue with customers on our school-customized social media channels, including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, as well as our student blog, The College Juice. Our exclusive Student POV online panel of over 8,000 students nationwide and our Parent POV online panel of over 2,800 parents help us to better understand their attitudes, values and behaviors. Using a marketing automation platform, we segment students based on demographics and purchasing behavior to ensure our audience receives the most relevant messages and experience. Our dynamic email campaigns educate students on format and affordability options as well as ongoing promotions from game day to graduation.
Through our search engine marketing strategies, BNC has been able to grow online textbook and apparel sales significantly. BNC’S official online bookstores for colleges or universities drove over $438 million of sales in Fiscal 2017. Nationwide, during the current fiscal year, we have built more than 695,000 connections with incoming students and their parents. These efforts have allowed us to maintain and expand market share and cement the college bookstore as the student's first choice for everything they need for academic success.
Promoversity has provided us with the ability to further customize our e-commerce solution to promote our partners’ brands more effectively and drive on-campus merchandise sales. Our True Spirit e-commerce sites for athletic branded merchandise continue to build our partner schools’ brands through alumni and athletics, fostering school spirit and capturing the excitement of collegiate sports. Our ability to support and promote our partner schools’ brands strengthens and deepens our relationships with the administration, faculty, alumni, parents and students. Additionally, our access to alumni through university alumni offices, including over 920,000 alumni with existing customer accounts, allow us to leverage digital marketing strategies on our dedicated fan and alumni e-commerce sites focused on athletic game day and other milestone events for further general merchandise sales growth in school-spirit apparel and related items.
Seasonality
BNC’s business is highly seasonal, with the major portion of sales and operating profit realized during the second and third fiscal quarters, when college students generally purchase and rent textbooks for the upcoming semesters. Revenue from the rental of physical textbooks is deferred and recognized over the rental period commencing at point of sale. Revenue from the rental of digital textbooks is recognized at time of sale. Our fiscal year is comprised of 52 or 53 weeks, ending on the Saturday closest to the last day of April.
MBS TEXTBOOK EXCHANGE
In February 2017, we acquired MBS, the largest contract operator of virtual bookstores for the higher education and private/parochial K-12 school markets, and one of the largest textbook wholesalers in the United States. For additional information, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4. Acquisitions and Strategic Agreements.
This acquisition significantly enhances our competitive positioning, increasing our addressable market to include K-12 schools and higher education institutions that need virtual bookstore solutions as an alternative to or in addition to a physical store on campus. The acquisition also increases our addressable market for our digital courseware and analytics solutions, and enables us to generate more value from the textbook marketplace through inventory and procurement synergies.
Our MBS subsidiary operates two highly integrated businesses: MBS Direct and MBS Wholesale. The MBS Direct business is the largest contract operator of virtual bookstores for college and university campuses, and private/parochial K-12 schools, operating 712 virtual bookstores. MBS Direct signed 80 new accounts in Fiscal 2017 with estimated first year annual sales of $17 million, and has signed additional contracts to open 46 new accounts in Fiscal 2018 for estimated first year annual sales of $8 million. MBS Direct offers new and used print and digital textbooks, which are available for sale or rent. Our ability to offer existing and prospective clients physical, virtual and hybrid bookstore models is a key element of our competitive strategy. Additionally, MBS Direct sells textbooks directly to students through textbooks.comSM, one of the largest e-commerce sites for new and used textbooks.

Platform Services
MBS Direct utilizes Course Director, a web-based product that allows faculty and/or staff to research, update, approve and submit textbook adoptions online, as well as make informed decisions on adoptions as the application gives real-time information regarding title availability, edition status and price. This real-time inventory information is leveraged from the inventory sourced first from MBS Wholesale, primarily for used textbooks. Using the MBS Direct system ensures that the fulfillment order is directed first to MBS Wholesale before other sources of inventory are utilized.
Our MBS Wholesale business also provides inventory management, hardware and point-of-sale software to more than 477 college bookstore customers. MBS provides on-site installation for point-of-sale terminals and servers, and offers technical assistance through user training and our support center facility. The cost savings and ease of deployment ensure clients get the

most out of their management systems and create strong customer loyalty. These systems also direct all orders through MBS, giving MBS first rights to fill or refuse the order.
Supply Chain Management
MBS is one of our largest suppliers of used textbooks, as well as new textbooks. An extensive national sales force secures a steady supply of highly-prized used books, which is critical to the success of the MBS Wholesale business. MBS’s broad wholesale distribution channel and warehousing systems also drive inventory efficiencies, allowing us to optimize our textbook sourcing, purchasing and liquidation processes. We can leverage MBS Wholesale’s distribution channel and warehousing systems to more efficiently source and distribute a robust, comprehensive inventory of affordable course materials to customers with the highest and greatest need. Through the proprietary MBS Database Buying Guide, we have access to the best maintained, most accurate, and most complete source of college textbook information available - a key asset that allows us to develop superior supply and demand insights and risk management capabilities.
MBS’s primary suppliers of used textbooks are students, through returns of previously rented and purchased books. MBS also purchases new and used textbooks from BNC, other bookstore operators, institutional bookstores, book dealers, publishers, other distributors and other wholesalers. MBS offers a "Cash for Books" program in which students can sell their books back to the store at the end of the semester, typically in December and May.
Customer Marketing Strategies
Students
MBS student marketing programs promote the retail businesses of MBS Direct and textbooks.comSM. MBS Direct marketing efforts target the student population of contracted schools. We email students frequently throughout the year to promote the online bookstore, offer purchasing incentives and encourage buyback, in addition to other communications. Textbooks.comSM marketing strategies target an online population of students, lifelong learners, parents and general textbook shoppers through a variety of channels including email, search engine marketing, affiliate marketing and display marketing.
School Administrators
To market MBS Direct and Wholesale services, MBS maintains an active contact list of school management and administrators of over 37,000 contacts. We produce and distribute print and digital marketing campaigns to this list several times throughout the year. MBS employs a field sales and marketing force tasked with representing the entire MBS line of products and services to schools across North America. 
During the last fiscal year, we have built more than 34,000 connections with current and potential clients through our blog sites and social media presence, and have had over 1.6 million visits to our primary business websites, mbsbooks.com and mbsdirect.net. These efforts have allowed us to capture market share and successfully engage administrators.
Seasonality
MBS’s business is highly seasonal. For MBS’s retail operations (virtual bookstores), a major portion of sales and operating profit are realized during the second and third quarters, when students generally purchase and rent textbooks for the upcoming semesters. For MBS’s wholesale business, a major portion of sales and operating profit is realized during the first, second and third fiscal quarters, as it sells textbooks for retail distribution, which somewhat offsets the decreased first quarter sales attributable to our retail business.
BUSINESS CONDITIONS AND COMPETITION
The market for educational materials is undergoing unprecedented change. Overall spending on education, including tuition, continues to increase dramatically. As tuition and other costs rise, colleges and universities face increasing pressure to attract and retain students and provide them with innovative, affordable educational content and tools that support their educational development.
Current competitive dynamics in the market for distribution of course materials include:

• | A Majority of Traditional Campus Bookstores Have Yet to be Outsourced: Approximately 52% of college and university affiliated bookstores in the United States are operated by their respective institutions. As the delivery of educational materials continues to evolve, driven in large part by the growth of rentals and digital content, and the complexity of modern campus bookstore operations increases, institutions are increasingly outsourcing bookstore operations to third parties such as us, because we can offer a complete set of solutions to students and faculty. We believe that we will benefit from the continuing trend towards outsourcing across the physical and virtual bookstore market. Our expanded capabilities enable us to customize our bookstores to meet customer needs, offering our partners the option of physical, virtual and hybrid bookstore models.

• | Direct Relationship with a Coveted Demographic: Due to the disproportionate impact on trend-setting and early adoption, marketing to college students is important for many brands, as they seek more effective methods to engage with this audience. We work with a number of brands in partnership marketing efforts, often engaging our Student POV panel of more than 8,000 students to learn how a certain brand is perceived on campus. The importance of this demographic provides a significant opportunity to further monetize our direct relationship with more than 6 million students both during and beyond their college years.


• | Increased Use of Online and Digital Platforms as Companions to Printed Course Materials: Students and faculty can now choose from a wider variety of educational content and tools than ever before, delivered across both print and digital platforms. Students and faculty are increasingly relying on online and digital platforms as a means to discover, consume and share educational content and access affordable non-traditional educational content, including online coursework and supplemental materials. Whereas some companies are creating digital delivery systems that would seek to make traditional textbooks obsolete, others are developing new technologies to complement traditional offerings. Importantly, we have the ability to adjust and grow our digital offering efficiently to complement our printed textbook sales and rental business.


• | Enrollment Trends: Community college enrollments saw continued declines in 2016, but the overall enrollment trend is expected to be positive over the longer term, and we remain confident in the industry projections of higher education enrollments to reach 22.6 million students by 2026. Technology-enabled education is a key growth area in the higher education industry, with an increasing number of students taking courses away from a traditional campus. According to a Digital Learning Compass report, students taking at least one distance education course comprised 29.7% of all higher education enrollments as of fall 2015. Online degree program enrollments continue to grow, even in the face of declining overall higher education enrollment. Our comprehensive digital offering, particularly with our OER courseware program and analytics capabilities, as well as our virtual bookstore solution, which provides students with the ability to purchase course materials directly through a dedicated e-commerce site, leave us well positioned to capitalize on this trend.


• | Distribution Network Evolving: The way course materials are distributed and consumed is changing significantly, a trend that is expected to continue. It is clear that significant change in the distribution of course materials is already underway as a result of start-ups promoting free online textbooks and generating revenue from related services, institutions licensing digital materials and providing them to students for a fee, or the surge of textbook rental programs in campus bookstores and online platforms. In addition to the official physical or virtual campus bookstore, course materials are also sold through off-campus bookstores, e-commerce outlets, digital platform companies, publishers’ direct sales to institutions and students, and student-to-student marketplaces.

The market for course materials, including textbooks and supplemental materials, is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We are experiencing growing competition from alternative media and alternative sources of textbooks and course-related materials, such as websites that sell or rent textbooks, eTextbooks, digital content and other merchandise directly to students; online resources, including open educational resources; publishers including Cengage, Pearson and McGraw Hill, bypassing the bookstore distribution channel by selling directly to students and educational institutions; print-on-demand textbooks; textbook rental companies; and student-to-student transactions over the Internet. 
In addition to the competition we face from alternative distribution sources, we also have competition from other college bookstore operators and educational content providers, including Akademos, a virtual bookstore and marketplace for academic institutions; Amazon.com, an e-commerce operator and a provider of contract services to colleges and universities; BBA Solutions, a college textbook retailer; bn.com, the e-commerce platform of Barnes & Noble, Inc.; Chegg.com, an online textbook rental company; Civitas Learning, a learning analytics platform; eCampus, an online provider of course materials; Follett Corporation, a contract operator of campus bookstores; IndiCo, an entity created by National Association of College Bookstores (“NACS”); Texas Book Company, bookstore management and operations; and Vital Source Technologies, Inc., a digital course materials provider. We also have competition from providers of eTextbooks, such as Apple iTunes, Blackboard, Google, and Redshelf, and various private textbook rental websites. 
In addition, Akademos and Amazon have recently begun to develop relationships with colleges and universities to provide online bookstore solutions which not only competes with our physical bookstore operations but also competes with our subsidiary MBS’ Direct virtual solution. MBS Direct also faces competition from Ambassador Educational Solutions, eCampus, edMap, EdTech, Follett Corporation, Texas Book Company, Tree of Life, and VitalSource Technologies, Inc. MBS Wholesale competes with Amazon, BBA Solutions, Follett, IndiCo, Nebraska Book Company, and Texas Book Company. 
Competitors that compete with our general merchandise offerings include Fanatics, Sodexo & Aramark, online retailers, and physical and online office supply stores. 
Students often purchase from multiple textbook providers, are highly price sensitive, and can easily shift spending from one provider or format to another. As a consequence, in addition to being competitive in the services we provide to our customers, our textbook business faces significant price competition. Some of our competitors have adopted, and may continue to adopt, aggressive pricing policies and devote substantial resources to marketing, website and systems development. 
16

In addition, a variety of business models are being pursued for the provision of print and digital textbooks, some of which may be more profitable or successful than our business model. Furthermore, the market for course materials is diluted from counterfeiting and piracy of digital and print copies or illegal copies of selected chapters made by students or others; user and faculty created content; and sharing or non-purchase of required course materials by students.
TRENDS AND OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS
Current trends and other factors affecting our business include:

• | Overall Economic Environment, College Enrollment and Consumer Spending Patterns: Our business is affected by funding levels at colleges and universities, by changes in enrollments at colleges and universities, and spending on textbooks and general merchandise. The growth of our business depends on our ability to attract new students and to increase the level of engagement by existing students. Historically, increasing enrollment has been a significant driver of sales growth at campus bookstores, a trend that is expected to continue in the long term. According to the National Center for Education Statistics of the U.S. Department of Education ("NCES"), total enrollment in post-secondary degree-granting institutions is expected to increase 9.6%, from 20.6 million in 2012 to 22.6 million in 2026 driven by increased demand for educational services.


• | Supply Chain and Inventory: Since the demand for used and new textbooks has historically been greater than the available supply, our financial results are highly dependent upon MBS Wholesale’s ability to build its textbook inventory from suppliers in advance of the selling season.


• | Demand for Digital Offerings: Over the longer-term, we anticipate significant new opportunities for our digital product offerings. Through our LoudCloud platform, we address the growing demand for alternative forms of educational materials and learning tools. Technology-enabled learning is a key growth area in the higher education industry, as a growing number of students are enrolling in online digital courses, and we are ready to meet demand with our virtual bookstore and e-commerce solutions, as well as our OER courseware offering.


• | New and Existing Bookstore Contracts: We expect awards of new accounts resulting in new physical and virtual store openings will continue to be an important driver of future growth in our business. We are awarded additional contracts for stores as colleges and universities decide to outsource their bookstore, and we also obtain new contracts for stores that were previously operated by competitors. Our virtual bookstore capability expands our addressable market to include schools that cannot or prefer not to have a physical campus bookstore. Sales trends are primarily impacted by new store openings, increasing the students and faculty served, as well as changes in comparable store sales and store closings. Closed stores are primarily comprised of satellite store locations that we elected to close and we continue to operate the main contract, contracts with low sales volume, as well as those contracts that may have been lost in a competitive bid process. During Fiscal 2017, BNC opened 38 stores with estimated first year annual sales of $118 million, and closed 20 stores. As of June 16, 2017, BNC has signed additional contracts for 23 new physical stores with estimated first year annual sales of $50 million, which we expect to open during our Fiscal 2018. MBS Direct has opened 80 virtual bookstores during the 52 weeks ending April 29, 2017, with estimated first year annual sales of $17 million, and has signed additional contracts to open 46 new accounts in Fiscal 2018 for estimated first year annual sales of $8 million. 


• | Campus Bookstore Outsourcing: We continue to see increasing trends towards outsourcing in the campus bookstore market, including virtual bookstores and online marketplace websites. We also continue to see a variety of business models being pursued for the provision of textbooks, course materials and general merchandise. Contract costs, which are included in cost of sales, and primarily consist of the payments we make to the colleges and universities to operate their official bookstores (management service agreement costs), including rent expense, have generally increased as a percentage of sales as a result of increased competition for renewals and new store contracts.


• | Course Materials Market: In addition to the competition in the services we provide to our customers, our textbook business faces significant price competition. Many students purchase from multiple textbook providers, are highly price sensitive and can easily shift spending from one provider or format to another. Some of our competitors have adopted, and may continue to adopt, aggressive pricing policies and devote substantial resources to marketing, website and systems development. As we expanded our textbook rental offerings, students have been shifting away from higher priced textbook purchases to lower priced rental options, which has resulted in lower textbook sales and increasing rental income. After several years of comparable store sales declines, primarily due to lower textbook unit volume, during the 52 weeks ended May 2, 2015, our comparable store sales trends improved for both textbooks and general merchandise. For the 52 weeks ended April 29, 2017, our comparable store sales declined by 3.0% primarily due to lower community college enrollment and general weakness in the retail environment.


• | Retail Environment: BNC general merchandise sales, which are subject to short-term fluctuations driven by the broader retail environment, continue to increase over the long term as our product assortments continue to emphasize and reflect the changing consumer trends, and we evolve our presentation concepts and merchandising of products in stores and online. However, lighter store traffic and a continued reluctance by the consumer to make discretionary purchases have created a softer retail

17

environment. We are confident in our assortment and have received encouraging customer response to our promotional and digital marketing efforts, especially as it relates to web orders. We are encouraged by the growth in our e-commerce sales and expect general merchandise sales to improve as the general retail environment rebounds, but we are taking a cautious approach given the overall uncertainty in the market.
EMPLOYEES
As of April 29, 2017, BNC and MBS had approximately 5,800 and 900 full time and regularly scheduled part-time employees, respectively, or a total of 6,700 full time and regularly scheduled part-time employees. In addition, both BNC and MBS hired approximately 13,000 and 350 additional temporary employees, respectively, during peak periods during Fiscal 2017. Our employees are not represented by unions, with the exception of 25 employees. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
