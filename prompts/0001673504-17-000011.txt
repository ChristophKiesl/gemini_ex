Business Concept

The number of medical travel consulting service provider is constantly growing. Sometimes it's difficult for customers to deal with that abundance of clinics and their proposals. Our company will serve as an intermediary between consumers and health care providers. Our main task is to collect information about medical service providers in Europe and Asia and provide our customers with comprehensive support in using their services. We will gather information based on several significant factors, such as price, conditions of stay in the clinic, applied treatment technologies, qualification and experience of medical personnel. Moreover, we are going to organize medical tours clinics selected by our customers. If our customer is not able to make a trip due to his or her health conditions or doesn't want to visit it in person, we are ready to implement online tours to medical organizations in Europe and Asia by means of Skype and Periscope.

We are also going to provide consulting for the purchase of medical equipment in Europe and Asia. Today, for example, China or South Korea are considered to be one of the fastest growing medical equipment markets. We intend to help our customers to choose medical equipment based on several criteria, such as price, available discounts, technical characteristics, warranty and delivery terms. Our job is to provide our potential customer with information about a particular manufacturer including full analysis and rating based on the above factors. We plan to save the time of our customers that they would spend searching and choosing the right manufacturer of medical devices and plan to relieve them from problems associated with such activity.

The next type of consulting is organization of seminars and workshops dedicated to traditional and non-traditional medical services in Asian countries. We are going to involve medical professionals, who will conduct seminars, master classes, lectures on various healthcare topics in person, or through webinars.
 We are also planning to organize short-term and long-term yoga and qigong courses in China, Tibet, Nepal and India. Oriental practices and physical exercises for the development of functional body are becoming more and more popular all over the globe. For example, almost any modern fitness club has a yoga course. More and more people prefer functional or spiritual practices such as yoga or qigong. Knowledgebase is concentrated mainly in the regions of China, Tibet, Nepal and India. The range of areas of yoga or qigong is wide. For example, yoga has 50 different directions. Professional teachers and gurus work in these areas. We are going to offer our customers a comprehensive analysis of Asian yoga and qigong schools based on the following factors: price, conditions of stay, proposed results. We are also planning to organize our own long-term and short-term yoga and qigong courses with the help of professional teachers.
