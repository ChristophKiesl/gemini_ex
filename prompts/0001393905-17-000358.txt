CORPORATE BACKGROUND

Grasshopper Staffing Inc (the Company), formally Tomichi Creek Outfitters, was incorporated in the state of Nevada on June 25, 2013. Our plan of operation is to provide our clients with a once in a lifetime experience to harvest a big game animal or to enjoy a guided scenic tour on the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains. Our operations are located in Sargents, Colorado, which is approximately four hours southwest of Denver. We are nestled just west of the continental divide surrounded by 12,000 to 14,000-foot mountain peaks. This territory is remote, yet accessible, and rich with diverse wildlife which is adjacent to the 1.86 million acre Rio Grande National Forest. The Company has access to over 500,000 acres of private land which is located adjacent to approximately 42 square miles of public land.

On March 2, 2015, the Company entered into a Business Acquisition Agreement and share exchange under which we acquired the business and assets of Grasshopper Staffing Inc. (Grasshopper Colorado), formed in the state of Colorado on January 13, 2015. The exchange for $10,651 was represented by 250,000 shares of the Companys common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Grasshopper Colorado. The assets purchased include the trademark and website, office supplies and office furniture. Grasshopper Colorado is operating as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and is now the primary operation of our business.
