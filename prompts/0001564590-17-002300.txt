The Company
 NCM, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was organized on October 5, 2006 and began operations on February 13, 2007 upon completion of its IPO. NCM, Inc. is a holding company that manages its consolidated subsidiary, NCM LLC.  NCM, Inc. has no business operations or material assets other than its cash and ownership interest of approximately 43.7% of the common membership units in NCM LLC as of December 29, 2016.  NCM LLC’s founding members, AMC, Cinemark and Regal, the three largest motion picture exhibition companies in the U.S., held the remaining 56.3% of NCM LLC’s common membership units as of December 29, 2016.  NCM, Inc.’s primary source of cash flow from operations is distributions from NCM LLC pursuant to the NCM LLC operating agreement.  NCM, Inc. also receives management fees pursuant to a management services agreement with NCM LLC in exchange for providing specific management services to NCM LLC.
 NCM LLC has long-term ESAs with the founding members (over 20 years remaining as of December 29, 2016) and multi-year agreements with certain third-party theater circuits, referred to in this document as “network affiliates,” which expire at various dates between July 14, 2017 and July 22, 2031.  The ESAs and network affiliate agreements grant NCM LLC exclusive rights in their theaters to sell advertising, subject to limited exceptions.
 Our Business
 We are America's Movie Network. As the #1 weekend network for Millennials (age 18-34) in the U.S., we are the connector between brands and movie audiences. 
 We currently derive revenue principally from the sale of advertising to national, regional and local businesses in FirstLook, our cinema advertising and entertainment pre-show seen on movie screens across the U.S. We also sell advertising on our Lobby Entertainment Network (“LEN”), a series of strategically-placed screens located in movie theater lobbies, as well as other forms of advertising and promotions in theater lobbies. In addition, we sell online and mobile advertising through our Cinema Accelerator digital product to reach entertainment audiences beyond the theater.
 We believe that the broad reach and digital delivery of our network provides an effective platform for national, regional and local advertisers to reach a large, young, engaged and affluent audience on a targeted and measurable basis.  
 On-Screen Advertising
 FirstLook—Our on-screen FirstLook pre-show was created to provide a more entertaining pre-movie experience for theater patrons while serving as an incremental revenue source for our theater circuit partners. It consists of national, regional and local advertising, as well as long-form entertainment and advertising content provided to us under exclusive multi-year arrangements with leading media, entertainment, technology and other companies (“content partners”). 
 FirstLook generally ranges in length from 20 to 30 minutes and ends at or about the advertised show time, when the movie trailers and feature film begin. The trailers that run before the feature film are not part of FirstLook. 
 Because FirstLook is customized by theater circuit, theater location/market, film rating, film genre and film title, we produce and distribute many different versions of FirstLook each month. This programming flexibility provides advertisers with the ability to target specific audience demographics and geographic locations, and gives us the ability to ensure that the content and advertising is age-appropriate for the movie audience. It also enables us to incorporate the branding of a specific theater circuit if desired. We rotate FirstLook’s long-form content segments between theaters approximately every two weeks to ensure that frequent moviegoers are entertained by fresh content.
 We also have the capability to deliver three-dimensional (“3-D”) advertising campaigns within a 3-D version of the FirstLook pre-show program prior to 3-D feature films.
 All versions of FirstLook are produced by our internal creative team, which is cost-effective and gives us significant flexibility. We also offer pre- and post-production advertising creative services to our clients (primarily local clients who may not have their own creative agency) for a fee.

Show Structure—FirstLook is comprised of up to four segments, each approximately four to seven minutes in length. 
  
• | Segment four is the first section of FirstLook and begins approximately 20 to 30 minutes prior to the advertised show time and generally includes local advertising.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Segment three typically begins approximately 18 minutes prior to the advertised show time and features primarily 15 or 30-second local or regional advertisements by individual theaters, or across an entire DMA® or geographic region, as well as a long-form entertainment content segment from one of our content partners.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Segment two begins approximately 13 minutes before the advertised show time and features primarily national and regional advertisements, which are generally 30 or 60 seconds, as well as a long-form entertainment content segment from one of our content partners.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Segment one runs closest to the advertised show time at approximately 8 minutes and features primarily national advertisements, which are generally 30 or 60 seconds, as well as a long-form entertainment content segment from one of our content partners. Segment one also includes an advertisement for the founding members’ beverage supplier and a public service announcement (“PSA”).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FirstLook pre-show typically includes the following.
 National, Regional and Local Advertising—On-screen advertising in FirstLook is sold on a cost per thousand (“CPM”) basis to national clients. We generally sell our national advertising units across our national network by film rating or groups of ratings, or by individual film or film genre grouping. This ability to target various groups of films offers national advertisers a way to target specific audience demographics at various price points and overall cost levels, which we believe expands the number of potential clients.
 Local and regional advertising is primarily sold on a per-screen, per-week basis and can also be sold on a CPM basis. Beginning in 2016, the FirstLook pre-show inventory also became available in the STRATA system, a media buying and selling software which allows advertising agencies to buy cinema in the National Spot TV marketplace. Being able to buy both TV and cinema locally in the National Spot marketplace makes it significantly easier for agencies to include cinema in the media mix for their clients and allows us to tap into a new pool of advertising dollars budgeted for National Spot.  
 Our cinema advertising business has a diverse customer base, consisting of national, regional and local advertisers. As of December 29, 2016, 504 national advertisers across a wide variety of industries have advertised with us. During the year ended December 29, 2016, we derived 70% of our advertising revenue from national clients (including advertising agencies that represent our clients) and 24% of our advertising revenue from thousands of regional and local advertisers across the country (including advertising agencies that represent these clients).
 Content. The majority of our entertainment and advertising content segments are provided to us by content partners. Under the terms of the contracts, our content partners make available to us original entertainment content segments that are entertaining, informative or educational in nature in the FirstLook program and make commitments to buy a portion of our advertising inventory at a specified CPM over a one or two-year period with options to renew, exercisable at the content partner’s option.  The original content produced by these content partners typically features behind-the-scenes looks at the “making-of” feature films, upcoming broadcasts, cable television shows, or technology products.  In 2016, all of our content partners provided approximately two-minute segments.
 PSA. We have two-year agreements to exhibit a 40-second courtesy “silence your cell phone” PSA reminding moviegoers to silence their cell phones and refrain from texting during feature films, one with an insurance company and another a candy company which expire at the end of 2017.  
 3-D Advertising. We also sell 3-D advertising, which runs prior to select 3-D films. These 3-D advertisements are placed at the end of the FirstLook pre-show, after a message instructing the movie audience to put on their 3-D glasses, so that the glasses can be kept on throughout the remainder of FirstLook, the film trailers and the 3-D feature film to provide for a better experience. 3-D advertisements provide average advertising CPMs that are higher than average two-dimensional (“2-D”) pricing due primarily to the fact that 3-D advertisements have heightened recall (based on third-party research).  
6


Beverage Advertising—We also have a long-term agreement to exhibit the advertising of the founding members’ beverage supplier. Under the ESAs, up to 90 seconds of the FirstLook program can be sold to the founding members to satisfy their on-screen advertising commitments under their beverage concessionaire agreements at a rate intended to approximate a market rate (per the ESA, the annual CPM change equals the prior year annual percentage change in the advertising CPM charged to unaffiliated third parties during segment one (closest to showtime) of the FirstLook pre-show, limited to the highest advertising CPM being then-charged by NCM LLC). Each of the founding members has a relationship with a beverage concessionaire under which they are obligated to provide on-screen advertising time as part of their agreement to purchase branded beverages sold in their theaters. During 2016, we sold 60 seconds to two of the founding members and 30 seconds to one of the founding members. During 2016, the beverage concessionaire revenue from the founding members’ beverage agreements was 6% of our total revenue. 
 Theater Circuit Messaging—The FirstLook program also includes time slots for the founding members and network affiliates to advertise various activities associated with the operations of the theaters, including concessions, online ticketing partners, gift card and loyalty programs, special events presented by the theater operator and vendors of services provided to theaters, so long as such promotion is incidental to the vendor’s service or products sold in the theater. This time is provided to the theater operator at no charge and generally includes 45 seconds within 15 minutes of show time, 15 seconds of which will be placed within 12 minutes of show time, and the remainder placed at our discretion.
 Lobby Advertising 
 Lobby Entertainment Network—Our LEN is a network of video screens strategically located throughout the lobbies of all digitally equipped founding members’ theaters, as well as the majority of our network affiliate theaters. As of December 29, 2016, our LEN had 3,029 screens in 1,505 theaters in our network. The LEN screens are placed in high-traffic locations such as concession stands, box offices and other waiting areas.  Programming on our LEN consists of an approximately 30-minute loop of branded entertainment content segments created specifically for the lobby with advertisements running between each segment. We have the scheduling flexibility to send different LEN programming to each theater through our DCN, and the same program is displayed simultaneously on all lobby screens within a given theater, which we believe provides the maximum impact for our advertisers. 
 We sell national and local advertising on the LEN individually or bundled with on-screen or other lobby promotions. 
 The LEN programming includes up to two minutes for founding members’ advertisements to promote activities associated with the operation of the theaters, including concessions, ticketing partners, gift card and loyalty programs, special events presented by the theater operator and vendors of services provided to theaters, so long as such promotion is incidental to the vendor’s service. Additionally, subject to certain limitations, the LEN programming includes up to two minutes (one minute of which we provide to the founding members at no cost and one minute of which the founding members may purchase) to promote certain non-exclusive cross-marketing relationships entered into by the theater operators for the purpose of increasing theater attendance, which we call “strategic programs.”
 Under the terms of the ESAs, the founding members also have the right to install additional screens in their theater lobbies which would not display our LEN programming, but would be used to promote strategic programs or products sold in their theater concessions, bars and dining operations, ticketing partner promotions, gift card and loyalty programs, special events presented by the founding member and vendors of services provided to theaters, so long as such promotion is incidental to the vendor’s service.
 Lobby Promotions
 We also sell a wide variety of advertising and promotional products in theater lobbies. These products can be sold individually or bundled with on-screen, LEN, online or mobile advertising. Lobby promotions typically include:

• | advertising on concession items such as beverage cups, popcorn bags and kids’ trays;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | coupons and promotional materials, which are customizable by film and are distributed to ticket buyers at the box office or as they exit the theater;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | tabling displays, product demonstrations and sampling;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | touch-screen display units and kiosks; and
--+-------------------------------------------


• | signage throughout the lobbies, including posters, banners, counter cards, danglers, floor mats, standees and window clings.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 7


Under the terms of the ESAs, the founding members may conduct a limited number of lobby promotions at no charge in connection with strategic programs that promote motion pictures; however, such activities will not reduce the lobby promotions inventory available to us.
 Our ability to provide in-lobby marketing and promotional placements in conjunction with our cinema advertising products allows us to offer integrated marketing solutions to advertisers that provide multiple touchpoints with theater patrons throughout the movie-going experience, which we believe is a competitive advantage over other national media platforms.
 Digital Advertising
 The Cinema Accelerator digital product expands cinema advertising beyond the theater environment to reach digitally-connected moviegoers before and after the movie experience, both online and on mobile devices. Cinema Accelerator identifies moviegoers through exclusive first party data sources including geo-location services, beacons and transaction data for the moviegoers that enter the theaters in our network. Using the moviegoer as our filter, we can target specific demographics, genres or layer on other data to provide to our clients with a match against their target audience. Digital ads are then distributed through multiple channels, including online and mobile banners, online and mobile pre-roll video and Facebook newsfeeds to reach moviegoers wherever they may be seeking entertainment information and content.  
 We sell Cinema Accelerator through a digital sales group that is embedded as part of our national and local sales organizations to enable collaborative, integrated selling.
 We believe that new digital products and revenue could be developed and additional in-theater advertisements could be sold as integrated marketing packages with digital offerings as discussed in “Business – Our Strategy”.  
Our Network
 In-theater advertising and entertainment content is distributed across NCM LLC’s national theater network — the largest digital in-theater network in North America. 
 Through the use of our proprietary DCN and Digital Content Software (“DCS”), we are able to schedule, deliver, play and reconcile advertising and entertainment content for FirstLook and the LEN on a national, regional, local, theater and auditorium level.
 Our DCN is the combination of a satellite distribution network and a terrestrial network, and we also employ a variety of technologies that “wrap” around the satellite process to help provide uninterrupted service to our network of theaters. The DCN is controlled by our Network Operations Center (“NOC”) located in our headquarters in Centennial, CO, which operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week to proactively monitor and manage approximately 670,000 alarm points and approximately 108,000 hardware devices in movie theaters throughout the country. Our NOC interfaces with our satellite provider network to dynamically control the quality, placement, timing of playback and completeness of content within specific auditoriums, and it also allows us to monitor and initiate repairs to the equipment in our digital network of theaters. 
 Advertising and entertainment content for our FirstLook pre-show and LEN is uploaded from our NOC and is then delivered via multicast technology to all theaters in our network and received by our theater management system, where it is held until displayed in specified theater auditoriums and lobbies according to contract terms. Each theater auditorium and lobby has a hardware and software architecture that controls the content to be shown. After the theater management system receives advertising/entertainment content, confirmation of content playback is returned via satellite to our NOC to be included in “post” reports provided to our advertising clients. 
 More than 700 million moviegoers annually attend theaters that are currently under contract to present the FirstLook pre-show and LEN programming, including the founding members and over 40 leading national and regional theater network affiliates. A summary of the screens and theaters in our advertising network is set forth in the table below:
 Our Network
 (As of December 29, 2016)
 
 
 | Advertising Network | 
-------------------+---------------------+------
 | Theaters | | Total Screens | | % of Total
Founding Members | | 1,274 | | 17,022 | | 82.8 | %
Network Affiliates | | 348 | | 3,526 | | 17.2 | %
Total | | 1,622 | | 20,548 | | 100.0 | %

As of December 29, 2016, our FirstLook pre-show was displayed on 100% of network movie screens using digital projectors, with approximately 98% of those screens receiving content through our DCN, representing approximately 98% of our total network attendance. As of December 29, 2016, 18,585, or 90%, of 20,548 total digital screens are equipped with more powerful digital cinema projectors, with the remainder comprised of LCD projectors. Those screens not connected to our DCN display national and regional advertisements on digital projectors with content delivered on USB drives that are shipped to the theaters via overnight delivery services.
 Our Team 
 We had 615 employees as of December 29, 2016. Our employees are located in our Centennial, Colorado headquarters, in our advertising sales offices in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Detroit, and our software development office in Minneapolis.  We also have many local advertising account executives and field maintenance technicians that work primarily from their homes throughout the U.S.  None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.  We believe that we have a good relationship with our employees.
 Sales, Marketing, Research and Creative—We sell our in-theater and online advertising products through our national, local and regional sales teams.
 As of December 29, 2016, we had 46 advertising sales and client development related personnel (including management and sales support staff) within our national sales group.  During 2016, approximately 30% of the total compensation of the national sales staff was related to bonus or commission, which is based on achieving certain sales targets in order to enhance coordination and teamwork.  Our national sales organization has proven to be profitable and scalable, as we have not added a significant number of sales personnel as our network has expanded. Our national sales staff is located in our sales offices in New York City, Woodland Hills, CA (outside Los Angeles), Chicago and Detroit.
 Our local and regional advertising sales staff, comprised of account directors and telesales representatives, is located throughout the country, with each covering an average of 112 screens per representative. Their responsibility is to sell cinema advertising to local clients as well as larger regional advertisers. During 2016, approximately 72% of the compensation for local sales staff was based on an individual sales commission on collected sales. As our network and local business grows, it may require the addition of sales personnel to cover the new markets or screens. As of December 29, 2016, we had 202 sales personnel (including management and sales support staff) within our local and regional sales groups, the majority of which work out of their homes located within the markets they sell.
 We market our advertising products through our marketing group located primarily in our New York City sales office. We aggressively market and sell directly to clients as well as advertising agencies, including our participation in the television upfront advertising selling process (the “Upfront”), which is launched each year with a presentation to clients and advertising agencies in New York City during the main TV Upfront week. Based on the success of our Upfront efforts, we believe that we are capturing additional market share from traditional advertising media platforms such as broadcast and cable television. We also believe that enhanced research regarding cinema advertising and expanded analytics about our network has aided our sales efforts by providing our customers with compelling statistical evidence of the superiority of our cinema advertising products relative to other advertising mediums based on metrics such as brand recognition, message recall, and likeability which can enable them to target their customers. Our research team conducts our own proprietary studies, and we also commission third-party market research to assist our sales team. We also promote our advertising products through public relations, social media and advertising in national trade publications. As of December 29, 2016, this team had 34 personnel based primarily in New York that focus on the marketing, research, public relations and corporate development aspects of our business.
 Our media and creative services department, based primarily in our Centennial, CO headquarters, uses state-of-the-art proprietary and non-proprietary technologies and practices to ensure the highest possible cinematic image and sound quality for our FirstLook pre-show and LEN programming distributed over our network. We provide a full spectrum of 2-D and 3-D production and post-production services to our advertising clients on a per contract fee basis, or as part of their advertising commitment, including audio enhancements, color correction and noise reduction. We believe that our expertise in creating and optimizing content for cinema playback within our FirstLook pre-show has been instrumental in our ability to provide a better experience for movie audiences, as well as enhances our ability to attract and retain our on-screen advertising clients and build and retain relationships with network affiliates. For national clients, our expertise in cinematic production and our ability to tailor advertisements developed for television, online or mobile to the high-definition cinema playback format required for the big screen allows our media team to use existing advertising creative, making it easier to add cinema to their media mix. For local clients, our ability to serve as a creative agency and develop full sight, sound and motion high-definition

cinema advertisements to meet their needs and budget reduces a significant barrier to entry for smaller businesses. During 2016, we produced and performed post-production services for approximately 41% of the local advertisements that played across our network. The founding members also engage us for the production of their on-screen concession product advertisements and policy trailers. As of December 29, 2016, we had 59 personnel that focused on the media, production and creative services aspects of our business.
 Operations and Planning—As of December 29, 2016, we had 109 personnel based primarily in our Centennial, CO headquarters that focused on the sales operations, planning and network operations aspects of our business. 
 Enterprise Information Systems, Finance, Legal, People & Organization, Affiliate Partnerships and Administration—As of December 29, 2016, we had 165 personnel based primarily in our Centennial, CO headquarters that focused on the Enterprise Information Systems, Finance, Legal, People & Organization (human resources), Affiliate Partnerships and Administration aspects of our business.
Competition
 Our advertising business competes in the estimated $191 billion U.S. advertising industry with many other forms of marketing media, including television, radio, print, internet, mobile and outdoor display advertising. While cinema advertising represents a small portion of the overall advertising industry today, we believe it is well positioned to capitalize on the shift of advertising spending away from traditional media, in particular television where consumers can skip advertisements through DVRs and other new digital technology, to newer and more targeted forms of media. 
 Our advertising business also competes with many other providers of cinema advertising, which vary substantially in size. As the largest cinema advertising network in the U.S., we believe that we are able to generate economies of scale, operating efficiencies and enhanced opportunities for our clients to reach an engaged movie audience on both a national and local level that allow us to better compete for premium video dollars in the larger advertising marketplace.
 Competitive Strengths
 We believe that several strengths position us well to compete in an increasingly fragmented media landscape.
 Superior National Advertising Network
 We believe that our cinema advertising network is an attractive option for marketers on both a national and local level, and delivers measurable results for our clients that are comparable, and indeed superior, to the television, online and mobile, or other video advertising networks that we compete against in the marketplace. 
 Extensive National Market Coverage—Our contractual agreements with the founding members and network affiliates provide long-term exclusive access (subject to limited exceptions) to sell cinema advertising across the largest network of digitally-equipped theaters in the U.S. This allows us to offer advertisers the broad reach and national scale that they need in an increasingly fragmented media marketplace.
As of December 29, 2016:
  
• | Our advertising network consisted of 20,548 screens (17,022 operated by the founding members) located in 1,622 theaters (1,274 operated by the founding members) in 48 states and the District of Columbia, including each of the top 25 and 50 DMAs®, and 189 DMAs® in total;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Approximately 73% of our screens (77% of our attendance) were located within the top 50 U.S. DMAs® and approximately 32% of our screens (37% of our attendance) were located within the top 10 U.S. DMAs®. Theaters within our network represented approximately 70%, 68%, and 66% of the total theater attendance in theaters that present advertising in the top 10, top 25 and top 50 U.S. DMAs®, respectively and 63% for all DMAs®, providing a very attractive platform for national advertisers who want exposure in larger markets or on a national basis;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our total annual network theater attendance was approximately 688.8 million (586.2 million from the founding members), which decreased 0.8% compared to 2015. Our network of modern theaters represented approximately 57% of the total U.S. theater attendance, with some of the most highly attended theaters in the industry, as measured by screens per location and attendance per screen; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The average screens per theater in our network was 12.7 screens, 1.8 times the U.S. theater industry average, and the aggregate annual attendance per screen of theaters included in our network during 2016 was 33,523, versus the U.S. theater industry average attendance per indoor screen of 32,893, using metrics reported by the National Association of Theatre Owners (“NATO”).

Scalable, State-of-the-Art Digital Content Distribution Technology—Our use of the combination of satellite and terrestrial network technology, combined with the design and functionality of our DCS and NOC infrastructure, makes our network efficient and scalable and also allows us to target specific audiences and provide advertising scheduling flexibility and reporting. We have also focused our efforts on shortening lead times through our Turbo initiative to accelerate the delivery time of media from proposal to on-screen across our network of movie theaters nationwide. While we had been able to offer this to national clients previously, this has also allowed us to shorten the lead-times for local and regional advertisers to run their ads in the FirstLook pre-show to less than 72 hours from proposal to delivery of the ad on screen (comparable to TV), which is a significant improvement over the cinema industry’s traditional turn-around time frame and gives businesses that rely on time-sensitive promotional advertising strategies, such as car dealerships, retail stores and Quick Service Restaurants (“QSR”), the opportunity to take advantage of the power of cinema.
 This scalability of our distribution technology has allowed us to expand our cinema advertising network with minimal additional capital expenditures or personnel, and we expect to benefit from this scalability in the future as we add new theaters from the founding members, our existing network affiliate relationships and the addition of new network affiliates. 
 Millennials, Content and Data
 We believe that the Millennial audiences (age 18-34) in our network of theaters, the premium content of Hollywood films and our FirstLook pre-show, and the advances we have made in cinema advertising data all give us a competitive advantage in the media marketplace.
 Access to a Highly Attractive, Engaged Audience—We offer advertisers the ability to reach highly-coveted target demographics, including young, affluent, and educated moviegoers. According to Nielsen Cinema Audience Reports for 2016, 54% of the NCM LLC audience were between the ages of 12-34 and our Millennial movie-going audience (age 18-34) grew over 16% in 2015, compared to 2014 and was up 4% in 2016.  Further, 38% of NCM LLC moviegoers have a household income greater than $100,000 (versus 28% of the general population) and 37% have received a Bachelor’s degree or higher (versus 29% of the general population) according to the 2016 Doublebase GfK MRI Study. 
 Because of the impact of cinema’s state-of-the-art immersive video and audio presentation, we also believe that movie audiences are highly engaged with the advertising and entertainment content that they view in our distraction-free theater environment. According to industry research, cinema advertising has significantly higher recall rates than advertising shown on television. And, cinema is one of the few advertising mediums where the ability to skip or turn off the marketing messages is limited. 
 Innovative, Branded Pre-Feature Content—The film content created by Hollywood studios is considered by many to be the finest entertainment content in the world, which creates a highly-desirable advertising environment for brands. We believe that our entertainment and advertising pre-feature program, FirstLook, provides a high-quality entertainment experience for theater audiences and an effective marketing platform for advertisers. By partnering with leading media, entertainment, technology and other companies, we are able to provide better original content for our audience and more impact for the advertiser. Because we offer local and national “pods” within our FirstLook pre-show, we are consistent with the placement of ads on television networks, which allows us to be more easily integrated into traditional sight-sound-and-motion media buys. 
 Superior Audience Measurability and Targeting—As with many other advertising mediums, we are measured by third-party research companies such as Nielsen Holdings PLC that provide us with the percentage of the total attendance in their seats at various times during our FirstLook pre-show. What differentiates us from other advertising mediums, however, is that we also receive monthly attendance information by film, by rating and by screen for all of the founding member theaters and the theaters operated by our network affiliates, which allows us to report the actual audience size for each showing of a film, including our FirstLook pre-show. We believe that the ability to provide this level of detailed information to our clients gives us a distinct competitive advantage over traditional media platforms whose measurement is based only on extrapolations of a very small sample of the total audience.
 During 2016, we continued to invest in our inventory management systems to expand our ability to target audiences by film genre. Our Cinema Audience Targeting Optimizer (“CATO”) now allows advertisers to go beyond targeting by the Motion Picture Association of America (“MPAA”) rating (G/PG, PG13 and R) to build media schedules at the film and genre level, more effectively targeting a brand’s key audience by matching it to the movie titles and/or genres that can best deliver that audience in a given campaign schedule. 
 11


In 2016, we also began the development of our cloud-based Data Management Platform (“DMP”) which we believe will allow us to provide even more robust campaign data and analytics to our clients. To further enhance the connection between brands and movie audiences, we will also be filtering media schedules through our new DMP – the first of its kind in the cinema industry – which will allow us to offer transaction-based insights, better targeted campaigns and closed-loop return on investment.
 Integrated Marketing Products
 Our ability to bundle our on-screen advertising opportunities with integrated lobby, online and mobile marketing products allow us to offer advertisers multiple touchpoints to reach movie audiences before, during and after the film to execute true 360-degree marketing programs. We believe these multiple marketing impressions throughout the entire entertainment experience allows our advertisers to extend the exposure for their brands and products and create a more engaging relationship with the consumer that is not available with broadcast or cable television or traditional display advertising.
Contractual Theater Circuit Partner and Advertiser Relationships
 Our exclusive multi-year contractual relationships with our founding members and network affiliates allow us to offer advertisers a national network with the scale, flexibility and targeting to meet their marketing needs. Our exclusive multi-year contractual relationships with our content partners and PSA sponsors, as well as our agreements to satisfy the founding members’ on-screen marketing obligations to their beverage concessionaires, provide us with a significant upfront revenue commitment, accounting for approximately 30% of our total revenue for the year ended December 29, 2016. In addition, our participation in the annual advertising Upfront marketplace has allowed us to secure significant annual upfront commitments from national advertisers looking to secure premium cinema inventory.
Strong Operating Margins with Limited Capital Requirements
 Our annual Adjusted OIBDA margins have been consistently strong, ranging from approximately 49% to 52% over the last five years.  (Refer to “Item 6. Selected Financial Data-Notes to the Selected Historical Financial and Operating Data” for a discussion of the calculation of Adjusted OIBDA margin, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, and the reconciliation to operating income.)  In addition, the founding members and their Digital Cinema Integration Partners, LLC (“DCIP”) joint venture have invested substantial capital to deploy, expand and upgrade the network equipment within their theaters including the recent deployment of the newer and higher quality digital cinema equipment. Due to the network equipment investments made by the founding members and network affiliates (in some cases through the DCIP digital cinema implementation joint venture) in new and acquired theaters and the requirements in the ESAs for the founding members to make future investments for equipment replacements, and the scalable nature of our NOC and other infrastructure, we do not expect to make major capital investments to grow our operations as our network of theaters expands. 
 Our capital expenditures have ranged from approximately 2% to 3% of revenues over the last five years. For the year ended December 29, 2016, our capital expenditures were $13.3 million, of which only $1.1 million primarily related to investments in network equipment to add new network affiliate theaters. We believe our expected level of Adjusted OIBDA and capital expenditures should provide us with the strategic and financial flexibility to pursue the further expansion of our national theater network, invest in other growth opportunities and continue to make dividend payments to our stockholders.
Our Strategy
 We are continuing to pursue a growth strategy that involves growing our network affiliate partnerships, growing on-screen revenue, expanding digital product offerings, ensuring that we are the first choice for our customers, developing our people and capabilities, and allocating resources to strategy.
Grow the Business
 We intend to focus on growing our business in the following strategic ways.
 Grow Affiliate Partnerships—Our relationships with our exhibitors are a key and renewed focus of our business. In 2016, we created a new Affiliate Partnership team dedicated to serving the needs of our founding member theater circuits and our more than 40 network affiliates nationwide. We continuously seek to expand our theater circuit customer base and add new network affiliate partners to our network that will allow us to increase our revenue by increasing the number of impressions we have available to sell to advertisers. It is also important to note that, under the terms of the ESAs and common unit adjustment agreement with the founding members and our network affiliate agreements, all new theaters built or acquired (subject to existing advertising sales agreements) by the founding members or network affiliates will become part of our network. Since NCM Inc.’s February 2007 IPO, the founding members have added approximately 4,000 net new 
 12


screens and 38 network affiliates have been added to our network with approximately 2,600 screens. During 2016, we added 187 net screens from the founding members and network affiliates and thus far in 2017 we have entered into contracts to add new affiliates with 370 screens. We expect this expansion to continue to improve our geographic coverage and enhance our ability to compete with other national advertising mediums, which will allow our exhibitor customers to maximize the advertising value of their audiences.
 Grow On-Screen Revenue—We plan to continue our successful strategy of selling our inventory like premium video in the larger advertising marketplace, once again utilizing the annual television upfront selling process to maximize our use of inventory. This Upfront strategy has yielded positive results over the past five years, and we believe that the increased market awareness among media buyers and clients raises our credibility as a medium and allows us to gain upfront commitments traditionally made exclusively to cable and broadcast television networks, and more recently online and mobile networks. Further, we believe it will help to increase our share of video advertising spending by increasing the number of clients and client industries that buy our network. Over time, this greater shift toward more Upfront commitments allows us to bundle several flights throughout the year and stabilize month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter CPM volatility by increasing overall inventory utilization and balancing that utilization throughout the year. Consistent with the television industry upfront booking practices, a portion of our upfront commitments have cancellation options or options to reduce the amount that advertisers may purchase that could reduce what is ultimately spent by clients that have made upfront commitments and we would need to rely on the scatter market to replace those commitments.
 At our fifth annual Upfront presentation in May of 2016 during the TV Upfront week, we announced several initiatives for better data-enhanced targeting, including CATO, which allows advertisers to go beyond targeting by MPAA rating to build media schedules at the film and genre level, and our new DMP – the first of its kind in the cinema industry – which will allow us to offer transaction-based insights, better targeted campaigns and closed-loop return on investment. We believe that these enhanced targeting capabilities will help to attract and retain a larger and more diverse range of advertising clients and thus grow our revenue.
 We also intend to increase our market share of local and regional advertising spending by aggressively pursuing further integration into agency planning and buying tools, such as our relationship with STRATA, a leader in media buying and selling software, which allowed agencies to buy cinema advertising in the National Spot marketplace for the first time in 2016. By making NCM an option in this and other industrywide and in-house agency planning and buying systems, we believe we can remove barriers to entry by incorporating cinema into media plans and tapping into new pools of advertising dollars. We also plan to introduce additional ways to optimize our regional inventory into our regional sales process, including expanding national, and instituting dynamic pricing that is responsive to week-to-week market demand and inventory availability on a regional level as we have successfully done on a national level. 
 Collect and Leverage Movie Audience Data—We intend to continue to secure additional data partnerships that will allow us to collect and leverage movie audience data to enhance the attractiveness of our cinema advertising products to advertisers. In addition, we plan to enhance and expand our digital marketing products beyond our Cinema Accelerator product, which identifies moviegoers’ mobile devices as they enter a theater, and re-engages them with a brand’s messages wherever they are consuming content — on mobile devices, social media, or online. 
 Reinvent the Lobby—As our founding member and network affiliate theater circuit partners continue to reinvent their lobby business, we plan to work with them and follow their lead to leverage technology partnerships and stabilize other lobby inventory to make the lobby a better source of advertising revenue for both our advertising customers and our circuit partners.
Be the First Choice for Customers
 Our approach is to always strive to be the first choice for our customers, including our advertising and agency customers, our exhibitors, and movie studios. By offering innovative on-screen, in-lobby and digital cinema advertising solutions to connect brands to unique, engaged and valuable young adult audiences at scale, we believe we can offer our advertiser and agency customers a valuable and effective marketing option that cannot be duplicated in any other medium. As the first choice for our customers, we can continue to expand our advertising client base and increase our market share of U.S. advertising spending. Our national sales team was successful in adding 34 clients in 2016 that were first time clients or had not advertised with us since our IPO. These new clients added in 2016 included companies in the apparel, beer, cable TV, computer hardware, department store, financial products and services, fitness, home audio equipment, home product, hotels and resorts, internet site, movie studio, personal care product, prepared food, family restaurant, supermarket, telecommunication hardware, tourism, toy and video game industries. Despite this growth, we believe there are still thousands of potential clients that currently advertise on other mediums such as television but have yet to advertise on our 
 13


network. These strategies are designed to expand our relationships with existing advertising clients and broaden our advertising client base in new and existing client industries.
 Develop People and Capabilities
 Our success is tied to the quality of our management and staff.  In order to ensure that we retain and attract high quality personnel, we seek to foster and maintain a culture that focuses on teamwork, personal growth, inclusion and diversity. We will continue to make meaningful investments in internal and external training programs for our management and staff to ensure that our personnel have, or build, the skillsets necessary to support our evolution and growth objectives. We have also adopted a succession plan that includes short-term and long-term planning elements to allow us to successfully continue operations should any of our senior management team become unavailable to us. 
Resources to Strategy
 We will continue to assess and eliminate off-target resources for a strategic focus on the future of NCM. We will be allocating resources to continuity and growth, with a focus from our staff on financial responsibility with company resources.
Dividend Policy
 Our dividend policy is described in “Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities—Dividend Policy”.
 Intellectual Property Rights
 We have been granted a perpetual, royalty-free license from the founding members to use certain proprietary software for the delivery of digital advertising and other content through our DCN to screens in the U.S. We have made improvements to this software since the IPO date and we own those improvements exclusively, except for improvements that were developed jointly by us and the founding members.
 We have secured U.S. trademark registrations for NCM, National CineMedia, NCM Media Networks, and Movie Night Out.  It is our practice to defend our trademarks and other intellectual property rights, including the associated goodwill, from infringement by others. We are aware that other persons or entities may use names and marks containing variations of our registered trademarks and other marks and trade names. Potentially, claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights, such as trademark infringement, could be brought against us by the users of those other names and marks. If any such infringement claim were to prove successful in preventing us from either using or prohibiting a competitor’s use of our registered trademarks or other marks or trade names, our ability to build brand identity could be negatively impacted.
 Government Regulation
 Currently, we are not subject to regulations specific to the sale and distribution of cinema advertising. We are subject to federal, state and local laws that govern businesses generally such as wage and hour and worker compensation laws.
