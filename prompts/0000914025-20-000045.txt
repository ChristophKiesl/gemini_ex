MARKET INFORMATION 
General Industry Background

Poly operates predominantly in the unified communications industry and focuses on the design, manufacture, and distribution of headsets, voice, video and content sharing solutions as well as a comprehensive line of support and service solutions to ensure customer success. We develop enhanced communication products for offices and contact centers, remote work environments, mobile devices, open SIP desktop phones, and PCs. Currently, we offer our products and services under the , Plantronics and Polycom brands. 
We believe the proliferation of communications and collaboration applications across much of people's daily lives makes efficiency, ergonomic comfort, ease of use, interoperability, and safety key factors for our customers' purchasing decisions. We believe important drivers for the adoption of our solutions include:

• | expansion of business collaboration platforms with integrated web-based video and content collaboration that demand interoperability and to support mobile and remote workers;


• | virtualization and accelerated adoption of private, public, and hybrid clouds and the resulting customer desire for cloud management tools;


• | ease of use and ease of deployment;


• | work from home or work from anywhere;


• | global growth of open office environments, small conference and huddle rooms, and the number of mobile and remote workers;


• | adoption of UC&C by small and medium-sized business (SMBs); and


• | continued commitment by organizations and individuals to reduce their expenses and carbon footprint by choosing voice, video and content collaboration over travel.

We believe we are uniquely positioned as the UC&C ecosystem partner of choice through our strategic partnerships, support of open standards, innovative technology, multiple delivery modes, and customer-centric go-to-market capabilities.
We leverage state-of-the-art technologies in our solutions that can be easily used in conjunction with our strategic partners' tools and common communication platforms in both personal and enterprise settings. The increased adoption of technologies such as UC&C, Bluetooth, Voice over Internet Protocol ("VoIP"), Digital Signal Processing ("DSP"), Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (“DECT”), and Video-as-a-Service ("VaaS"), each of which is described below, has contributed to increased demand for our solutions:
 3


• | UC&C is the integration of voice, data, chat, and video-based communications systems enhanced with software applications and Internet Protocol (IP) networks. It includes more traditional unified communications consisting of on-premise IP telephony, such as e-mail, instant messaging, presence information, audio and video conferencing, and unified messaging; and more modern team collaboration consisting of cloud-based persistent chat and team workspaces, integrated UC and application integrations; as well as browser-based online meetings consisting of integrated audio, video, and web conferencing. UC&C seeks to provide seamless connectivity and user experience for enterprise workers regardless of their location and environment, improving overall business efficiency and providing more effective collaboration among an increasingly distributed workforce. 


• | Bluetooth wireless technology is a short-range communications protocol intended to replace the cables connecting portable and fixed devices while maintaining high levels of security. The key features of Bluetooth technology are ubiquity, low power, and low cost. The Bluetooth specification defines a uniform structure for a wide range of devices to connect and communicate with each other. Bluetooth standard has achieved global acceptance such that any Bluetooth enabled device, almost anywhere in the world, can connect to other Bluetooth enabled devices in proximity. 


• | VoIP is a technology that allows a person to communicate using a broadband internet connection instead of a regular (or analog) telephone line. VoIP converts the voice signal into a digital signal that travels over the internet or other packet-switched networks and then converts it back at the other end so that the caller can speak to anyone with another VoIP connection or a regular (or analog) phone line. 


• | DSP is a technology that delivers acoustic protection and optimal sound quality through noise reduction, echo cancellation, and other algorithms which improve transmission quality.


• | DECT is a wireless communications technology that optimizes audio quality, lowers interference with other wireless devices, and digitally encrypts communication for heightened call security.


• | Video-as-a-Service (VaaS) is the delivery of multiparty or point-to-point videoconferencing capabilities over an IP network by a managed service provider.

Solutions 
UC&C audio and video solutions continue to represent our primary focus area. We believe our portfolio of solutions, which combines hardware with highly innovative sensor technology and software functionality, provides the ability to reach people using the mode of communication that is most effective, on the device that is most convenient, and with control over when and how people can be reached. Our solutions have played an increasingly important role in the work-from-home movement as people navigate new noise and connection challenges. With more demand for tele-services, mobile connections, and remote work styles, we believe that our UC&C portfolio provides the solutions necessary to connect doctors to patients, educators to students and companies to their employees. We also believe that as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, our UC&C platforms and technology will become baseline requirements for those inside and outside the office. We also believe our solutions will be an important part of the UC&C environment through the offering of contextual intelligence, a full portfolio of products designed according to quantitatively researched global work styles, and a unique cloud-based management and insight technology we call Poly Lens.
Our products enhance communications by providing the following benefits:

• | Smarter working and improved productivity through seamlessly connected, high-quality headsets that connect to mobile devices, PC/Macs, and desk phones, allowing users to communicate from their home, traditional workplace or while on-the-go


• | Face-to-face communication delivered through high quality headsets and specialized video devices that bring people together individually or in groups to share ideas and make decisions in a low-cost and highly efficient manner

FOREIGN OPERATIONS

In Fiscal Years 2020, 2019, and 2018, net revenues outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 52%, 53%, and 49%, respectively, of our total net revenues.  Revenues derived from foreign sales are generally subject to additional risks, such as fluctuations in exchange rates, increased tariffs, the imposition of other trade restrictions or barriers, adverse global economic conditions, and potential currency restrictions.  In Fiscal Year 2020, consolidated net revenues were unfavorably impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates resulting in a decrease of approximately $14.7 million in net revenues (net of the effects of hedging).
 6

We continue to engage in hedging activities to limit our transaction and economic exposures, and to mitigate our exchange rate risks.  We manage our economic exposure by hedging a portion of our anticipated Euro ("EUR") and British Pound Sterling ("GBP") denominated sales and our Mexican Peso ("MXN") denominated expenditures, which together constitute the most significant portion of our currency exposure.  In addition, we manage our balance sheet exposure by hedging EUR, GBP, and Australian Dollar ("AUD") denominated cash, accounts receivable, and accounts payable balances. Excess foreign currencies not required for local operations are converted into U.S. Dollars ("USD"). While our existing hedges cover a certain amount of exposure for Fiscal Year 2021, long-term strengthening of the USD relative to the currencies of other countries in which we sell may have a material adverse impact on our financial results. In addition, our results may be adversely impacted by future changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to original hedging contracts generally secured 12 months prior. See further discussion on our business risks associated with foreign operations under the risk titled, "We are exposed to differences and frequent fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect our revenues, gross profit, and profitability" within Item 1A Risk Factors in this Form 10-K.
Further information regarding our foreign operations, as required by Item 101(d) of Regulation S-K, can be found in Note 20, Geographic Information, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
COMPETITION

We compete broadly in the UC&C market, where we have multiple competitors (depending on the product line) on a global basis. These competitors include, Avaya Inc., Aver Information, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., ClearOne Communications, Inc., GN Netcom, Grandstream Networks, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., LifeSize Inc., Logitech International S.A., Neat, Sennheiser Communications, Snom Technology GmbH, Vidyo, Inc., Yamaha Corporation/Revolabs, Inc., Yealink Network Technology Co., Ltd., ZTE Corporation and others. In some cases, we also cooperate and partner with these companies in programs and various industry initiatives. The market for our products is competitive and some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do, as well as more substantial production, marketing, engineering and other capabilities to develop, manufacture, market, and sell their products.

Our strategy of offering a best-in-class complete portfolio of UC&C headset, voice and video endpoints faces challenges from competitors, who create end-to-end service and endpoint solutions, as well as low cost competitors in specific categories, or other industry players, who are potentially able to develop unique technology or compete in a specific geography.
For Services, some of our partners resell our maintenance and support services, while others sell their own branded services. To the extent that channel partners sell their own services, these partners compete with us; however, they typically purchase maintenance contracts from us to support these services. As we expand our professional services offering, we may compete more directly with partners in the future.
We believe the principal factors to be successful and competitive in each of the markets we serve are as follows:

• | Understanding emerging trends and new communication technologies, such as UC&C and VaaS, and our ability to react quickly to the opportunities they provide


• | Reliable supply chain to meet peak demands


• | Alliances and integration/compatibility with major UC&C vendors


• | Ability to design, manufacture, and sell products that deliver on performance, style, ease-of-use, comfort, features, sound quality, interoperability, simplicity, price, and reliability


• | Ability to create and monetize software solutions that provide management and analytics and allow business to improve IT and employee performance through insights derived from our analytics.


• | Brand name recognition and reputation


• | Superior global customer service, support, and warranty terms


• | Global reach, including effective and efficient distribution channels

We believe our products and strategy enable us to compete effectively based on these factors.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

The success of our new products is dependent on several factors, including identifying and designing products that meet anticipated market demand before it has developed and as it matures, timely development and introduction of these products, cost-effective manufacturing, quality and durability, acceptance of new technologies, and general market acceptance of the products we develop.  See further discussion regarding our business risks associated with our manufacturers under the risk titled, "We face risks associated with developing and marketing our products, including new product development and new product line" within Item 1A Risk Factors in this Form 10-K. 
Historically, we have conducted most of our research, development, and engineering with an in-house staff and a limited use of contractors.  
During Fiscal Year 2020, we developed and introduced innovative products that enabled us to better address changing customer demands and emerging market trends.  Our goal is to bring the right products to customers at the right time utilizing best-in-class development processes.

The products we develop require significant technological knowledge and the ability to rapidly develop the products in intensely competitive and transforming markets. We believe our extensive technological knowledge and portfolio of intellectual property gives us a competitive advantage. We furthermore continually strive to improve the efficiency of our development processes through, among other things, strategic architecting, common platforms, and increased use of software and test tools.
SALES AND DISTRIBUTION 

We maintain a worldwide sales force to provide ongoing global customer support and service.  To support our partners in the Enterprise market and their customers' needs, we have well-established, two-tiered distribution networks. 
Our global channel network includes enterprise distributors, direct and indirect resellers, retailers, network and systems integrators, service providers, wireless carriers, and mass merchants.  
Our distributors, direct and indirect resellers, system integrators, managed service providers, e-commerce partners, telephony and computer equipment providers resell our commercial headsets, voice and video endpoint products and related solutions and services. As we evolve into new markets and product categories, we expect to build relationships in new distribution and marketing models.
In addition, we have built a strong foundation of alliance partners, which allow existing and future distribution and reseller partners to sell into Microsoft, Zoom, Google and other service provider environments. Our commercial distribution channel maintains an inventory of our products.  Our distribution of specialty products includes retail, government programs, customer service, hospitality and healthcare professionals. Poly branded headsets are sold through retailers to corporate customers, small businesses, and individuals who use them for a variety of personal and professional purposes. 
Our commercial distributors and retailers represent our first and second largest sales channels in terms of net revenues, respectively. Two customers, ScanSource and Ingram Micro Group, accounted for 19.8% and 17.3%, respectively, of consolidated net revenues in Fiscal Year 2020. Two customers, ScanSource and Ingram Micro Group, accounted for 16.0% and 11.4%, respectively, of consolidated net revenues in Fiscal Year 2019. One customer, Ingram Micro Group, accounted for 10.9% of consolidated net revenues in Fiscal Years 2018. 
Some of our products may also be purchased directly from our website at www.poly.com.

We continue to evaluate our logistics processes and implement new strategies to further reduce our transportation costs and improve lead-times to customers. Currently, we have distribution centers in the following locations:

• | Tijuana, Mexico, which provides logistics services for products destined for customers in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America regions


• | Laem Chabang, Thailand, which provides logistics services for products shipped to customers in our Asia Pacific regions


• | Prague, Czech Republic, which provides logistics services for products shipped to customers in our Europe, Africa and Middle East regions


• | Suzhou, China, which provide logistics services for products shipped to customers in Mainland China


• | Melbourne, Australia, which provides logistics services for products shipped to the retail channel in Australia and New Zealand


• | San Diego, United States, which provides logistics services for products shipped to customers in the Americas Region

With respect to the above locations, we use third party warehouses in the Czech Republic, Thailand, and Australia. We operate warehouse facilities in Mexico, San Diego and Suzhou.
BACKLOG

We believe that backlog information is not material to understanding our overall business or estimating future performance and results due to the fact that sales of our products typically have relatively short lead-times. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and global shelter-in-place orders creating a surge in the number of individuals working from home or from remote locations, we experienced an increase in demand and backlog, primarily in our Headset product category. However, the backlog of unfulfilled orders is subject to rescheduling, or in limited cases, may be subject to cancellation, especially as we manage through supply-chain constraints due to COVID-19.
MANUFACTURING AND SOURCES OF MATERIALS

Our manufacturing operations are conducted through our facility in Tijuana, Mexico and through contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers in Laos and China. Our manufacturing facility in Tijuana, Mexico is approximately 792,300 square feet, that we have owned and have operated for the last 48 years. The manufacturing operations of our Mexico facility consists of materials management, prototyping, assembly, testing, automation, packaging and Americas distribution center operations. The factory and distribution center are located in very close proximity to the US freight port of entry enabling flexible and responsive supply to our primary market. For a further discussion of the business risks associated with our manufacturers see the risk titled, “If our own manufacturing facilities and those of our contract manufacturers, original design manufacturers, suppliers and sub-suppliers are unable or unwilling to timely deliver sufficient quantities of quality materials and components and finished products, our ability to fulfill customer demand may be adversely impacted and our growth, business, reputation and financial condition may be materially adversely affected” within Item 1A Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Three global distribution centers serve Asia, Europe and Americas and a fourth smaller distribution center serves China. The locations of all distribution centers are selected to optimize labor costs, duties, tax considerations and customer responsiveness.
We utilize GoerTek, Inc., Celestica Incorporated, Wistron Corporation, and Sercomm Corporation for the majority of our contract manufacturing and original design manufacturing. Our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers are responsible for all phases of manufacturing from prototyping to production. Together with our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers we design, specify, test, and monitor products to ensure that they meet the quality requirements and standards our customers demand. 
We source components for our products primarily from suppliers in Asia, Mexico, and the U.S., including integrated circuits, electrical and mechanical components, and sub-assemblies. A majority of the components and sub-assemblies used in our manufacturing operations are obtained, or are reasonably available, from dual-source suppliers, although we do have a number of sole-source suppliers.

During the fourth quarter ended March 28, 2020, concerns related to the spread of COVID-19 began to create global business disruptions, including disruptions in our operations and creating potential negative impacts on our revenue. Disruptions include interruption in product supply, restrictions on the export or shipment of our products, and temporary closure of supplier and manufacturing facilities. The outbreak has resulted in the shutdown of various manufacturing partners, suppliers, including for approximately 2 weeks at our facility in Tijuana, Mexico. The extent to which COVID-19 will impact our financial results and operations is uncertain. There can be no assurance that the disruptions due to COVID-19 will be resolved in the near term at our facility in Tijuana, Mexico. Related to COVID-19 reference see the risk titled, "Adverse or uncertain global and regional economic conditions may materially adversely affect us." within Item 1A Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
For strategic purposes and to mitigate the risk of component shortages for critical and long lead-time components, we may purchase and hold certain inventory. As a result, we may incur inventory carrying costs, obsolescence charges, that result from uncertain product demands. 
In addition, a substantial portion of the raw materials, components, and sub-assemblies used in our products are provided by our suppliers on a consignment basis. Refer to “Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations”, within Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details regarding consigned inventories. We write down inventory items determined to be either excess or obsolete to their net realizable value.
We work collaboratively with our suppliers and are members of Responsible Business Alliance and Responsible Mineral Initiative. We endeavor to promote responsible social and ethical business practices within our company and in our global supply chain. We require all of our suppliers to share this commitment through acknowledgment of our newly refreshed Supplier Code, and with the understanding that any violations may jeopardize their business relationship with Poly. We also work with suppliers to promote conflict-free sourcing of all parts and products supplied to us. As members of the Responsible Mineral Initiative and active participants in the working groups of Due Diligence Practices, and China Smelter or Refiner ("SOR") Engagement, we support the RMI’s Responsible Minerals Assurance Process - a program that audits SOR’s due diligence activities to provide information about the country of origin of minerals. We have also conducted further due diligence in accordance with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ("OECD") Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High Risk Areas (OECD 2016) on those SORs known to or, it is believed may, source minerals from the DRC, adjoining countries, or countries considered to be possible smuggling routes of materials from the conflict area. 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

We are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those governing the use, discharge, and disposal of hazardous substances in the ordinary course of our manufacturing process.  We believe that our current manufacturing and other operations comply, in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We are required to comply, and we believe we are currently in compliance with the European Union (“EU”) and other Directives on the Restrictions of the use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”) and on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) requirements.  Additionally, we believe we are compliant with the RoHS initiatives in China and Korea; however, it is possible that future environmental legislation may be enacted, or current environmental legislation may be interpreted to create an environmental liability with respect to our facilities, operations, or products. See further discussion of our business risks associated with environmental legislation under the risk titled, "We are subject to environmental laws and regulations that expose us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs" within Item 1A Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

We obtain patent protection for our technologies when we believe it is commercially appropriate.  As of March 28, 2020, we had over 1,500 worldwide utility and design patents in force, expiring between calendar years 2020 and 2045.
We intend to continue seeking patents on our inventions when commercially appropriate. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and preserve other intellectual property rights covering the design and operation of our products.  See further discussion of our business risks associated with our intellectual property under the risk titled, "Our intellectual property rights could be infringed on by others, and we may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others resulting in claims or lawsuits. Even if we prevail, claims and lawsuits are costly and time consuming to pursue or defend and may divert management's time from our business" within Item 1A Risk Factors of this Form 10-K.

 10

We own trademark registrations in the U.S. and in a number of other countries, as well as the names of many of our products and product features.  We currently have pending U.S. and foreign trademark applications in connection with our Poly brand name and certain new products and product features, and we may seek copyright protection when and where we believe appropriate.  We also own a number of domain name registrations and intend to seek more as appropriate.  We furthermore attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through comprehensive security measures, including agreements with our employees, consultants, customers, and suppliers. See further discussion of our business risks associated with intellectual property under the risk titled "Our intellectual property rights could be infringed on by others, and we may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others resulting in claims or lawsuits. Even if we prevail, claims and lawsuits are costly and time consuming to pursue or defend and may divert management’s time from our business" within Item 1A Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
EMPLOYEES

On March 28, 2020, we employed approximately 6,584 people worldwide, including approximately 3,138 employees at our shared services facility in Tijuana, Mexico.
