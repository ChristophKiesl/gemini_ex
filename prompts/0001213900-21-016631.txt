Introduction
 
We are a blank check company incorporated on July 24, 2020 as a Cayman Islands exempted company and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, amalgamation, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities.
 
In July 2020, our Sponsor purchased 7,187,500 of the Company’s Class B ordinary shares (the “Founder Shares”) for $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share. In September 2020, we effected a share capitalization of 1,437,500 of our Class B ordinary shares, resulting in our Sponsor holding an aggregate of 8,625,000 Founder Shares (up to 1,125,000 shares of which were subject to forfeiture to the extent the underwriters of our Initial Public Offering did not exercise their over-allotment option). On September 11, 2020, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full. On September 10, 2020, our Sponsor transferred 35,000 Founder Shares to each of our independent directors. The holders of our Founder Shares prior to our Initial Public Offering are referred to herein as our “initial shareholders.”
 
On the IPO Closing Date, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 34,500,000 units (the “Units”), including 4,500,000 Units that were issued pursuant to the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option in full. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to us of approximately $345.0 million. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share and one-fourth of one redeemable warrant. Each whole warrant (a “public warrant”) entitles the holder thereof to purchase one of our Class A ordinary shares at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment, and only whole warrants are exercisable. The public warrants will become exercisable on the later of 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination and 12 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering, and will expire five years after the completion of our initial business combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.
 
On September 15, 2020, simultaneously with the consummation of our Initial Public Offering, we completed the private sale of 5,933,333 private placement warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a purchase price of $1.50 per warrant to TortoiseEcofin Borrower LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“TortoiseEcofin Borrower”) and an affiliate of our Sponsor, generating gross proceeds to us of approximately $8.9 million. Each Private Placement Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one of our Class A ordinary shares at $11.50 per share. The Private Placement Warrants (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise thereof) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holder until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination.
 
Approximately $345.0 million of the net proceeds from our Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants has been deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of our public shareholders (the “Trust Account”).
 
In connection with our Initial Public Offering, CIBC National Trust Company (“CIBC National Trust”) entered into a forward purchase agreement (the “Forward Purchase Agreement”) with us pursuant to which we may elect, in our sole and absolute discretion, to offer CIBC National Trust the opportunity to purchase forward purchase units, consisting of one Class A ordinary share (the “Forward Purchase Shares”) and one-fourth of one redeemable warrant (the “Forward Purchase Warrants”), where each whole redeemable warrant is exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at an exercise price of $11.50 per share (the “Forward Purchase Units”), and, if CIBC National Trust accepts such offer, it commits to purchase at least a minimum aggregate amount equal to either (a) 10% of the gross proceeds from a private placement that may close simultaneously with the closing of our initial business combination or (b) 10% of the gross proceeds from the Initial Public Offering (the “Minimum Aggregate Amount”), and up to a maximum aggregate amount of $100,000,000 of Forward Purchase Units at a price per unit equal to the public offering price (the “Maximum Aggregate Amount”). The Forward Purchase Shares will be identical to the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering and the Forward Purchase Warrants will have the same terms as the public warrants, except the Forward Purchase Shares and the Forward Purchase Warrants will be subject to transfer restrictions and certain registration rights. The funds from the sale of the Forward Purchase Units may be used as part of the consideration to the sellers in the initial business combination, and any excess funds may be used for the working capital needs of the post-transaction company. The Forward Purchase Agreement is subject to conditions, including CIBC National Trust specifying the amount of Forward Purchase Units between the Minimum Aggregate Amount and Maximum Aggregate Amount (the “Specified Amount”) it wishes to purchase after we notify CIBC National Trust of our intention to offer CIBC National Trust the opportunity to purchase Forward Purchase Units. We may specify, in our sole and absolute discretion and at any time prior to or after CIBC National Trust has indicated its Specified Amount, an amount below the Specified Amount that we are willing to sell to CIBC National Trust. CIBC National Trust may choose to accept our offer to purchase the Forward Purchase Units entirely within its sole discretion. Accordingly, if CIBC National Trust does not accept our offer to purchase the Forward Purchase Units, it will not be obligated to purchase the Forward Purchase Units. We entered into a subscription agreement with CIBC National Trust in connection with the Business Combination Agreement (as defined below) pursuant to which CIBC National Trust agreed to purchase, subject to the satisfaction of applicable closing conditions, shares of our Class A Common Stock (as defined below). As a result, on February 8, 2021, we delivered a notice to CIBC National Trust stating that we will not elect to offer CIBC National Trust the opportunity to purchase Forward Purchase Units pursuant to the Forward Purchase Agreement.

We received gross proceeds from our Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants of approximately $345.0 million and $8.9 million, respectively, for an aggregate of approximately $353.9 million. Approximately $345.0 million of the gross proceeds were deposited into the Trust Account. The approximately $345.0 million of net proceeds held in the Trust Account includes approximately $12.1 million of deferred underwriting discounts and commissions that will be released to the underwriters of our Initial Public Offering upon completion of our initial business combination. Of the gross proceeds from our Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants that were not deposited in the Trust Account, approximately $6.9 million was used to pay underwriting discounts and commissions in connection with our Initial Public Offering, approximately $181,000 was used to repay loans and advances from our Sponsor, and the balance was reserved to pay accrued offering and formation costs, business, legal and accounting due diligence expenses on prospective acquisitions and continuing general and administrative expenses.
 
The Class B ordinary shares that we issued prior to the IPO Closing Date will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares at the time of our initial business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment for share sub-division, share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like. In the case that additional Class A ordinary shares, or equity-linked securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts sold in our Initial Public Offering and related to the closing of the initial business combination, the ratio at which the Class B ordinary shares will convert into Class A ordinary shares will be adjusted (unless the holders of a majority of the outstanding Class B ordinary shares agree to waive such adjustment with respect to any such issuance or deemed issuance) so that the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all issued and outstanding Class B ordinary shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of the total number of all ordinary shares outstanding upon the completion of our Initial Public Offering plus all Class A ordinary shares and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with the business combination (excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the business combination). Our Sponsor and our initial shareholders, pursuant to the Sponsor Letter (as defined below) entered into in connection with the Business Combination Agreement, agreed to waive the anti-dilution rights set forth in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, subject to the BCA Closing (as defined below).
 
On October 30, 2020, we announced that, commencing on November 2, 2020, holders of the Units sold in our Initial Public Offering may elect to separately trade the Class A ordinary shares and public warrants included in the Units. The Class A ordinary shares and public warrants that are separated trade on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbols “SNPR” and “SNPR WS,” respectively. Those Units not separated will continue to trade on the NYSE under the symbol “SNPR.U.”
 
Our Company
 
We are a recently organized blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company in July 2020 and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, amalgamation, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K as our initial business combination. We intend to acquire and operate a business in the broad energy transition or sustainability arena targeting industries that require innovative solutions to decarbonize in order to meet critical emission reduction objectives. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures will require annual investments of $1.6-$3.8 trillion in the global supply-side energy system through 2050, with some climate scenarios requiring net-zero global emissions by 2050, resulting in the need for high-growth energy transition and technology solutions. In light of this and other developments fostering a sense of urgency and responsibility, as of February 2021, more than 1,000 companies worldwide are leading the zero-carbon transition by setting emissions reduction targets through the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). We believe our management team, together with Tortoise and the Tortoise Ecofin Platform, both affiliates of our Sponsor, are well suited to identify opportunities that create a positive environmental impact, exhibit strong Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) attributes and have the potential to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders, although we may pursue a business combination opportunity in any business or industry.

Our management team and an affiliate of Tortoise co-founded Tortoise Acquisition Corp. (“Tortoise Acquisition I”; NYSE: SHLL), a special purpose acquisition company that completed its initial public offering in March 2019, in which it sold 23,300,917 units, each consisting of one share of Class A common stock and one-half of one warrant, with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock, for an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating aggregate proceeds of approximately $233 million. In October 2020, Tortoise Acquisition I consummated its initial business combination with Hyliion Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Hyliion”), a leader in electrified powertrain solutions for Class 8 commercial vehicles. The combined entity, Hyliion Holdings Corp., is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “HYLN.” We believe that we will benefit from the valuable experience gained by our management team during the launch and operation of Tortoise Acquisition I, including the process of evaluating numerous target companies and industry sectors, selecting Hyliion as its business combination partner, negotiating the terms of the business combination agreement and all of the related financing transactions, soliciting stockholder approval and consummating the business combination and the related transactions.
 
Our extensive sourcing network includes (i) business founders, owners and senior management contacts, (ii) private equity, financial investors and other sponsors of private businesses and (iii) industry professionals, including investment banking, legal, accounting and other industry focused experts. We believe that there are highly attractive investment opportunities that are accessible through our network of contacts which exist within our focus industries and also exhibit strong ESG profiles. We believe our management team’s experience and combined expertise provide us with unique insight to evaluate targets across numerous sectors, including clean and renewable energy and related infrastructure, electric and autonomous mobility, energy efficiency and battery storage solutions, environmental services, hydrogen, renewable and bio fuels, and waste to energy and recycling, among others. Businesses that we plan to target for our initial business combination will be those that are at an inflection point in their life cycle and that we believe can benefit from our strategic insights, capital and expertise to accelerate their business development, improve their business prospects and unlock the full value of their businesses.
 
We believe in the ability of our management team to add significant value to a target company from a business building, commercial, capital markets and sustainability perspective. Our extensive operational experience and the public company expertise of our management team present the potential for an attractive risk-adjusted return profile through our involvement and stewardship. As demonstrated by our management team with Tortoise Acquisition I’s consummated business combination with Hyliion, we believe that the extensive skills and perspectives of our management team will enable us to identify dynamic and visionary management teams and work alongside them to crystalize their strategic vision, enhance their business plan and improve their operational capabilities. In addition, our team has significant hands-on experience working with growth-oriented companies in preparing for and executing an initial public offering or an initial business combination, and serving as active owners and directors by working closely with these companies to assist in the execution of their strategic plan, support their continued transformations and help access and create value in the public markets.
 
We believe we play an important role in the public equity markets by identifying high-quality, growth-oriented businesses, evaluating the merits and viability of high-growth business plans and completing pre-investment due diligence, focusing and preparing the business for the multi-faceted requirements of being a publicly traded company, and both capitalizing and leading the actual business combination transaction. This function will be invaluable to our eventual business combination target, as we have the skills to validate and enhance their business plan, improve their ESG profile and prepare them for the rigors of being publicly listed, as well as to our investors who might otherwise not have the opportunity or confidence to publicly invest in the business we identify in the transition towards a decarbonized and cleaner future.

We have entered into a Forward Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we may elect, in our sole and absolute discretion, to offer CIBC National Trust the opportunity to purchase Forward Purchase Units, consisting of one Class A ordinary share and one-fourth of one redeemable warrant, where each whole redeemable warrant is exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, and, if CIBC National Trust accepts such offer, it commits to purchase at least a Minimum Aggregate Amount equal to either (i) 10% of the gross proceeds from a private placement that may close simultaneously with the closing of our initial business combination or (ii) 10% of the gross proceeds from our Initial Public Offering, at CIBC National Trust’s sole discretion, and up to a Maximum Aggregate Amount of $100,000,000 of Forward Purchase Units at a price per unit equal to the public offering price. The Forward Purchase Shares will be identical to the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units being sold in our Initial Public Offering and the Forward Purchase Warrants will have the same terms as the public warrants, except the Forward Purchase Shares and the Forward Purchase Warrants will be subject to transfer restrictions and certain registration rights. The funds from the sale of the Forward Purchase Units may be used as part of the consideration to the sellers in the initial business combination, and any excess funds may be used for the working capital needs of the post-transaction company. This agreement is independent of the percentage of shareholders electing to redeem their public shares and may provide us with an increased minimum funding level for the initial business combination. The Forward Purchase Agreement is subject to conditions, including CIBC National Trust specifying the amount of units between the Minimum Aggregate Amount and Maximum Aggregate Amount it wishes to purchase after we notify CIBC National Trust of our intention to offer it the opportunity to purchase Forward Purchase Units. We may specify, in our sole and absolute discretion and at any time prior to or after CIBC National Trust has indicated its specified amount, an amount below the specified amount that we are willing to sell to CIBC National Trust. CIBC National Trust may choose to accept our offer to purchase the Forward Purchase Units entirely within its sole discretion. Accordingly, if CIBC National Trust does not accept our offer to purchase the Forward Purchase Units, it will not be obligated to purchase the Forward Purchase Units.
 
Additionally, pursuant to the terms of the Forward Purchase Agreement, we granted CIBC National Trust the right to appoint a single observer to our board of directors until the consummation of our initial business combination. Such observer does not have voting rights or otherwise have any of the powers of a member of our board of directors. We entered into a subscription agreement with CIBC National Trust in connection with the Business Combination Agreement pursuant to which CIBC National Trust agreed to purchase, subject to the satisfaction of applicable closing conditions, shares of our Class A Common Stock. As a result, on February 8, 2021, we delivered a notice to CIBC National Trust stating that we will not elect to offer CIBC National Trust the opportunity to purchase Forward Purchase Units pursuant to the Forward Purchase Agreement.
 
Management, Our Sponsor and Board of Directors
 
We are led by our co-founder Vincent Cubbage, who serves as our Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board and has over 26 years of investment experience. Mr. Cubbage also serves as Chief Executive Officer and as a Director of TortoiseEcofin Acquisition Corp. III, a newly incorporated blank check company (“TortoiseEcofin III”). Mr. Cubbage co-founded and served as Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board of Tortoise Acquisition I and continues to serve on the board of directors of Hyliion Holdings Corp. following the closing of Tortoise Acquisition I’s business combination with Hyliion. Mr. Cubbage joined Tortoise Capital Advisors, L.L.C. in January 2019 and is a Managing Director on the Private Energy Transition team. Prior to joining Tortoise Capital Advisors, L.L.C., Mr. Cubbage founded private equity firm Lightfoot Capital in 2006 and served as its Chief Executive Officer and Managing Partner from 2006 to 2019. Mr. Cubbage also served as the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Arc Logistics GP LLC, the general partner of Arc Logistics Partners LP (NYSE: ARCX), a portfolio company formed by Lightfoot Capital in 2007 and sold in 2017. Prior to founding Lightfoot Capital, Mr. Cubbage was an investment banker and, among other positions, was a Senior Managing Director and sector head in the Investment Banking Division of Banc of America Securities.
 
Our management team includes all of the members of the management team of Tortoise Acquisition I. Mr. Stephen Pang serves as our Chief Financial Officer and Director on our Board. He also serves as President and Chief Financial Officer and as a Director of TortoiseEcofin III and served as Chief Financial Officer and a board member of Tortoise Acquisition I and continues to serve on the board of directors of Hyliion Holdings Corp. following the closing of Tortoise Acquisition I’s business combination with Hyliion. Mr. Pang is a Managing Director on the Private Energy Transition team at Tortoise Capital Advisors, L.L.C. and is responsible for the firm’s public and private direct investments, including PIPEs. Throughout its history, Tortoise Capital Advisors, L.L.C. has been involved in over 85 PIPEs across various investment vehicles. Mr. Darrell Brock serves as our Vice President of Business Development and Mr. Steven Schnitzer serves as our Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, each of whom serves in the same capacities for TortoiseEcofin III and served in the same capacities for Tortoise Acquisition I. Mr. Evan Zimmer, an employee of Tortoise who was dedicated to the business combination activities of Tortoise Acquisition I, serves as our Vice President of Finance and currently serves in the same capacity for TortoiseEcofin III. Messrs. Brock, Schnitzer and Zimmer served in similar capacities at Lightfoot Capital and Arc Logistics under Mr. Cubbage’s leadership. The members of our entire management team have extensive experience identifying, evaluating, negotiating and completing the types of transactions that we plan to pursue for our initial business combination.

We are further supported by our board of directors, comprised of former senior executives who have been at the forefront of forward thinking on climate change, and sustainability policies and companies leading the transition to a cleaner future. They come from a wide range of sub-sectors and functional areas and provide us with access to their expertise and extensive industry networks from which we source and evaluate targets as well as devise plans to optimize any business that we acquire.
 
Our management team also draws upon the resources and support of Tortoise and the Tortoise Ecofin Platform, the latter of which brings decades of investing expertise in the areas of sustainability, energy transition, infrastructure, water and clean energy. Founded in 2002, Tortoise has a family of investment funds with over $7.8 billion of assets under management as of February 28, 2021. Tortoise has built a successful track record through a disciplined investment framework, with expertise that spans across the entire energy value chain in addition to sustainable infrastructure, including wind, solar and battery storage assets and social infrastructure. Tortoise is a signatory to the United Nations’ Principles for Responsible Investment and incorporates SDGs and ESG factor analysis into its investment strategy, policies and practices firmwide. Tortoise’s “Teal Energy Deal” promotes a reduction in carbon emissions globally by adopting a transition to a cleaner energy future. The Teal Energy Deal principally aligns with the following four SDGs: (1) No poverty; (7) Affordable and Clean Energy; (9) Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure; and (13) Climate Action.
 
We believe that potential sellers of target businesses will view the fact that our management team has successfully consummated a business combination for Tortoise Acquisition I as a positive factor in considering whether or not to enter into and consummate a business combination with us. However, past performance of our management team, Tortoise Acquisition I, Tortoise or Lightfoot Capital is not a guarantee either (i) of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate or (ii) that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination. You should not rely on the historical record of our management team, Tortoise Acquisition I, Tortoise, Lightfoot Capital or any related investment’s performance as indicative of our future performance.
 
Business Strategy
 
Our acquisition strategy is to identify and complete our initial business combination with a company that is playing an active role in providing solutions to reduce emissions and/or improve the sustainability of products and industries, along with making a positive impact on the communities that it serves by employing efficient and innovative business practices. We intend to target a company and management team that shares our commitment to good governance and transparency.
 
We believe our management team’s track record and execution experience, including its experience sourcing Hyliion for Tortoise Acquisition I and consummating the business combination thereof, together with the deep industry and investing experience of our Sponsor combined with the extensive experience of our Chief Executive Officer and management team, make us very well positioned to identify, source, negotiate and execute a business combination that meets our investment criteria and generates attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.
 
Our management team and the investment professionals of our Sponsor have an extensive network of senior industry contacts, including corporate executives, investment banking professionals, private equity and other financial sponsors, and owners of private businesses. In addition, Tortoise has a long history of partnering with leading public and private equity investors. We believe this network is a key competitive advantage in sourcing attractive business combination targets that meet our criteria, and that the reputation and expertise of our management team and Tortoise around energy transition and sustainability themes will make us a preferred partner for potential business combination counterparties.

Our management team brings a diversity of transactional and investing experience that will enable us to evaluate opportunities across multiple sectors. Throughout his long career, including as Chief Executive Officer of Tortoise Acquisition I, investment banker, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Partner of Lightfoot Capital and Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of NYSE-listed Arc Logistics, our Chief Executive Officer oversaw the evaluation of hundreds of acquisitions and investments. As a Managing Director and Portfolio Manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors, L.L.C., Mr. Pang has evaluated and made numerous portfolio company investments across a broad platform of industry sectors and strategies. We believe the breadth of Tortoise’s and Messrs. Cubbage’s and Pang’s investment experience across multiple sub-sectors is a competitive advantage.
 
We believe that the operational experience of our management team should enable us to enhance the strategic vision and operational performance of the assets and businesses that we acquire in order to maximize value for shareholders. This may include improving operating efficiencies, increasing margins and profitability, driving revenue growth, investing in organic growth projects, pursuing future strategic acquisitions or divestitures and optimizing the capital structure. We believe our expertise in identifying and sourcing compelling investment opportunities combined with our strategic and operational proficiency in creating value provides a competitive advantage relative to other strategic and financial buyers.
 
Our management team and Sponsor have a deep understanding of capital markets, which we believe is an important aspect of a special purpose acquisition company management team. We believe our Chief Executive Officer’s and our Chief Financial Officer’s extensive track records of public and private investments, including PIPEs, provide valuable expertise in evaluating and executing capital markets transactions. We believe that the combination of our management team’s experience and network in the private and public equity markets, together with the resources of Tortoise and the Tortoise Ecofin Platform, will allow us to effectively identify, evaluate, finance and structure the business combination transaction.
 
We believe that our proven, differentiated and disciplined approach to sourcing, analyzing and ultimately executing an initial business combination enables us to find targets with attractive risk-adjusted return profiles for our shareholders. We have core investing tenets that guide our rigorous evaluations and commit to turning down opportunities that don’t satisfy our risk-adjusted return framework.
 
As outlined above, we have an integrated team with a full suite of strategic, financial, legal and operational capabilities, allowing us to identify targets and complete our due diligence in a thorough and expedited manner. We believe our integrated team and affiliation with Tortoise will also allow us to pursue a number of transaction opportunities concurrently and compress the time required from initial identification of an opportunity to transaction announcement.
 
Business Combination Criteria
 
Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating candidates for our initial business combination. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating business combination opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to focus on candidates that we believe:

● | will benefit from our team’s operating expertise, technical expertise, structuring expertise, extensive network, insight and capital markets expertise;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | exhibit unrecognized value or other characteristics, desirable returns on capital, and a need for capital to achieve the company’s growth strategy, that we believe have been misevaluated by the marketplace based on our analysis and due diligence review;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | are at an inflection point, are in need of additional management expertise, are able to innovate through new operational techniques, or where we believe we can drive improved financial performance;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | have attractive opportunities to grow the business through organic growth projects and third-party acquisitions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6
-


● | will be well received by public investors and are expected to have good access to the public capital markets;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | are engaged in activities that are consistent with Tortoise’s and management’s view of macro trends; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | are expected to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the SEC.
 
Initial Business Combination
 
The NYSE rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount held in the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. Our board will make the determination as to the fair market value of a target business or businesses. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of a target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of a target business or businesses, it may be unable to do so if the board is less familiar or experienced with the target company’s business or there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the company’s assets or prospects.
 
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association requires the affirmative vote of a majority of our board of directors, which must include a majority of our independent directors and each of the non-independent directors nominated by our Sponsor, to approve our initial business combination.
 
We may, at our option, pursue a business combination opportunity jointly with one or more entities affiliated with Tortoise and/or one or more investors in funds or separate accounts managed by Tortoise, which we refer to as an “Affiliated Joint Acquisition.” Any such parties would co-invest only if (i) permitted by applicable regulatory and other legal limitations; (ii) we and Tortoise considered such a transaction to be mutually beneficial to us as well as the affiliated entity; and (iii) other business reasons exist to do so, such as the strategic merits of including such co-investors, the need for additional capital beyond the amount held in our Trust Account to fund the business combination transaction and/or the desire to obtain committed capital for closing the business combination transaction. An Affiliated Joint Acquisition may be effected through a co-investment with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the business combination by issuing to such parties a class of equity or equity-linked securities. We refer to this potential future issuance, or a similar issuance to other specified purchasers, as a “specified future issuance.” The amount and other terms and conditions of any such specified future issuance would be determined at the time thereof. We are not obligated to make any specified future issuance and may determine not to do so. This is not an offer for any specified future issuance. Pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of our Class B ordinary shares, any such specified future issuance would result in an adjustment to the conversion ratio such that our initial shareholders and their permitted transferees, if any, would retain their aggregate percentage ownership at 20% of the sum of the total number of all ordinary shares outstanding upon completion of our Initial Public Offering plus all shares issued in the specified future issuance (excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the business combination), unless the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding Class B ordinary shares agreed to waive such adjustment with respect to the specified future issuance at the time thereof. We cannot determine at this time whether a majority of the holders of our Class B ordinary shares would then agree to so waive such adjustment to the conversion ratio. They may waive such adjustment due to (but not limited to) the following: (i) closing conditions which are part of the agreement for our initial business combination; (ii) negotiation with Class A shareholders on structuring an initial business combination; (iii) negotiation with parties providing financing which would trigger the anti-dilution provisions of the Class B ordinary shares; or (iv) as part of the Affiliated Joint Acquisition. If such adjustment is not waived, the specified future issuance would not reduce the percentage ownership of holders of our Class B ordinary shares, but would reduce the percentage ownership of holders of our Class A ordinary shares. If such adjustment is waived, the specified future issuance would reduce the percentage ownership of holders of both classes of our ordinary shares. Our Sponsor and our initial shareholders, pursuant to the Sponsor Letter entered into in connection with the Business Combination Agreement, agreed to waive the anti-dilution rights set forth in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, subject to the BCA Closing.

We anticipate structuring our initial business combination either (i) in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses or (ii) in such a way so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, including an Affiliated Joint Acquisition. However, we will only complete a business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise is not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions, and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking shareholder approval, as applicable.
 
Our Business Combination Process
 
In evaluating prospective business combinations, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review process. This due diligence review process will be specific to the target business, but will include, among other things, a review of historical and projected financial and operating data, meetings with management and their financial sponsors (if applicable), an assessment of the commodity price risk of the business and our ability to mitigate such risks with hedges, on-site inspection of assets, discussion with customers, legal and environmental reviews and other reviews as we deem appropriate. We will also utilize our expertise and Tortoise’s expertise operating companies and evaluating operating projections, financial projections and determining the appropriate return expectations given the risk profile of the target business.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with Tortoise or our officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with Tortoise or our officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
 
Members of our management team and our independent directors directly or indirectly own Founder Shares and/or Private Placement Warrants following the Initial Public Offering and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors were to be included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.

All of the members of our management team are employed by Tortoise or affiliates of Tortoise. Tortoise and its affiliates are continuously made aware of potential business opportunities, one or more of which we may desire to pursue for a business combination.
 
Tortoise and each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. For example, Tortoise and certain of its officers currently are obligated by contract to offer or allocate certain investment opportunities first to specific private funds managed by them.
 
Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. We believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of Tortoise and our officers or directors will not materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. In addition, we may, at our option, pursue an Affiliated Joint Acquisition opportunity with an entity to which Tortoise or an officer or director has a fiduciary or contractual obligation. Any such entity may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the business combination by making a specified future issuance to any such entity. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation.
 
Our officers and directors have agreed not to become an officer or director of any other special purpose acquisition company with a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination or we have failed to complete our initial business combination within 24 months after the closing of our Initial Public Offering, or 27 months after the closing of our Initial Public Offering if we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an initial business combination within 24 months after the closing of our Initial Public Offering but have not completed the initial business combination within such 24-month period.
 
Our Management Team
 
Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any members of our management team will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process.
 
We believe our management team’s operating and transaction experience and relationships with companies provides us with a substantial number of potential business combination targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships around the world. This network has grown through the activities of our management team sourcing, acquiring and financing businesses, our management team’s relationships with sellers, financing sources and target management teams and the experience of our management team in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions. See “Part III, Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance” for a more complete description of our management team’s experience.
 
Status as a Public Company
 
We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange all of their outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests in the target business for our Class A ordinary shares (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our Class A ordinary shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.

Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital, an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders’ interests and the ability to use its equity as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
 
While we believe that our structure and our management team’s backgrounds will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek shareholder approval of any proposed initial business combination, negatively.
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our Initial Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion (as adjusted for inflation pursuant to SEC rules from time to time), or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (ii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
 
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (i) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter or (ii) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter.
 
Effecting our Initial Business Combination
 
We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and the private placement of the Private Placement Warrants, our shares, debt or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.

10
--


If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of purchases of our Class A ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
 
Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely affect a target business.
 
We may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in the Trust Account or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of the business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the Trust Account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by applicable law, we would seek shareholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to issue securities or incur debt in connection with our initial business combination. We are not currently a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities, the incurrence of debt or otherwise.
 
Sources of Target Businesses
 
We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the track record and business relationships of our officers and directors. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of a finder’s fee is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the Trust Account. In no event, however, will our Sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation by the company prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). We have agreed to pay Tortoise Capital Advisors, L.L.C., an affiliate of our Sponsor, a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities, secretarial support and administrative services and to reimburse our Sponsor for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing an initial business combination. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, or from making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
 

11
--


If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us. We may pursue an Affiliated Joint Acquisition opportunity with an entity to which an officer or director has a fiduciary or contractual obligation. Any such entity may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by issuing to such entity a class of equity or equity-linked securities.
 
Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination
 
The NYSE rules require that our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount held in the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or from an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
 
In any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire an interest in the target sufficient for the post-transaction company not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be valued for purposes of the NYSE’s 80% of net assets test.
 
To the extent we effect our business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review, which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as applicable, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction.
 
Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. The company will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination.

Lack of Business Diversification
 
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. In addition, we intend to focus our search for an initial business combination in a single industry. By completing our business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
 
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
 
We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.
 
Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
 
Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve our Initial Business Combination
 
We may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons. Under the NYSE’s listing rules, shareholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:

● | we issue Class A ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of our Class A ordinary shares then outstanding (other than in a public offering);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | any of our directors, officers or substantial shareholders (as defined by the NYSE rules) has a 5% or greater interest, directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired and if the number of ordinary shares to be issued, or if the number of ordinary shares into which the securities may be convertible or exercisable, exceeds either (a) 1% of the number of ordinary shares or 1% of the voting power outstanding before the issuance in the case of any of our directors or officers or (b) 5% of the number of ordinary shares or 5% of the voting power outstanding before the issuance in the case of any substantial shareholders; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control.

Permitted Purchases of our Securities
 
In the event we seek shareholder approval of our business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no limit on the number of shares our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and the rules of the NYSE. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the Trust Account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such shareholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights.
 
In the event that our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.
 
The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.
 
In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our ordinary shares or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
 
Our Sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the shareholders with whom our Sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders (in the case of Class A ordinary shares) following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling shareholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the Trust Account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such shareholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination but only if such shares have not already been voted at the general meeting related to our initial business combination. Our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their affiliates will select which shareholders to purchase shares from based on the negotiated price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant, and will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.
 
Any purchases by our Sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our Sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of ordinary shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.

Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination
 
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions we will pay to the underwriters of our Initial Public Offering. Our Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares held by them and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our business combination.
Limitations on Redemptions
 
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). However, the proposed business combination may require (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
 
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would require shareholder approval. If we structure a business combination transaction with a target business in a manner that requires shareholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a shareholder vote to approve the proposed business combination. We currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote unless shareholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement and we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other legal reasons.
 
If we hold a shareholder vote to approve our initial business combination, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:
 

● | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

 
In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.
 

15
--


If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if we obtain the approval of an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of a majority of the ordinary shares, represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon, voted and who vote at a general meeting. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of the Company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial shareholders will count toward this quorum and have agreed to vote their Founder Shares and any public shares purchased during or after our Initial Public Offering in favor of our initial business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding ordinary shares voted, abstentions and non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, in addition to our initial shareholders’ Founder Shares, we would need 12,937,501, or 37.5%, of the 34,500,000 public shares sold in our Initial Public Offering to be voted in favor of the business combination (assuming all outstanding shares are voted) in order to have our initial business combination approved, subject to any higher consent threshold as may be required by Cayman Islands or other applicable law. We intend to give approximately 30 days (but not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days) prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our initial business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial shareholders, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether it votes for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of a business combination.
 
If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:
 

● | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E under the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Upon the public announcement of our business combination, we or our Sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase our Class A ordinary shares in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
 
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination.
 
Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Shareholder Approval
 
If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in our Initial Public Offering, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares.” We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in our Initial Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our Sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 20% of the shares sold in our Initial Public Offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our business combination.

Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination
 
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that we will have only 24 months (or 27 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering if we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering) from the closing of our Initial Public Offering to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within such 24-month period (or 27-month period as applicable) we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our business combination within the 24-month time period (or 27-month time period, as applicable).
 
Our Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Founder Shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 24 months (or 27 months, as applicable) from the closing of our Initial Public Offering. However, if our Sponsor, officers or directors acquire public shares in or after our Initial Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted 24-month time period (or 27-month time period, as applicable).
 
Our Sponsor, officers, directors and director nominees have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within 24 months (or 27 months, as applicable) from the closing of our Initial Public Offering, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. Pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, such an amendment would need to be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of all then outstanding ordinary shares who attend and vote in a general meeting.
 
We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts held outside the Trust Account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the Trust Account not required to pay income taxes on interest income earned on the Trust Account balance, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.

--


The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
 
Although we will seek to have all vendors (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason. Our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent public accountants) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations, and we believe that our Sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the Trust Account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
 
In the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. We have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations and we cannot assure you that our Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per public share.

We will seek to reduce the possibility that our Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. Our Sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. At the IPO Closing Date, we had access to up to approximately $1,000,000 from the proceeds of our Initial Public Offering with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our Trust Account could be liable for claims made by creditors.
 
If we file a winding up petition or a winding up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable insolvency law, and a liquidator may determine that such funds should be included in our insolvency estate and subject to the claims of third-party creditors with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy or insolvency claims deplete the Trust Account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a winding up petition or a winding up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be subject to challenge under applicable debtor/creditor and/or insolvency laws as a “voidable preference.” As a result, a liquidator could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
 
Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 24 months (or 27 months, as applicable) from the closing of our Initial Public Offering, subject to applicable law, (ii) in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within 24 months (or 27 months, as applicable) from the closing of our Initial Public Offering or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the Trust Account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in such shareholder redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote.
 
Limited Payments to Insiders
 
There will be no finder’s fees, reimbursements or cash payments made by the Company to our Sponsor, officers or directors, or our or their affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, other than the following payments, none of which will be made from the proceeds of our Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account prior to the completion of our initial business combination:

● | repayment of up to an aggregate of $600,000 in loans made to us by our Sponsor to cover offering-related and organizational expenses;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | reimbursement for office space, utilities, secretarial support and administrative services provided to us by Tortoise Capital Advisors, L.L.C., an affiliate of our Sponsor, in an amount equal to $10,000 per month;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating, negotiating and completing an initial business combination; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | repayment of loans which may be made by our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans.

Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Proposed Business Combination
 
Business Combination Agreement
 
On February 7, 2021, we entered into a business combination agreement and plan of reorganization (the “Business Combination Agreement”) with SNPR Merger Sub I, Inc., a Delaware corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary (“First Merger Sub”), SNPR Merger Sub II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and our wholly owned subsidiary (“Second Merger Sub” and, together with First Merger Sub, the “Merger Subs”), and Volta Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Volta”), pursuant to which First Merger Sub will merge with and into Volta (the “First Merger”), with Volta surviving the First Merger as our wholly owned subsidiary (the “Surviving Corporation”), and the Surviving Corporation will subsequently merge with and into Second Merger Sub (the “Second Merger,” together with the First Merger, the “Mergers,” and together with the other transactions related thereto, the “Proposed Transactions”), with Second Merger Sub surviving the Second Merger as our wholly owned subsidiary. The announcement of the Proposed Transactions was filed with the SEC on a Current Report on Form 8-K on February 8, 2021.
 
The consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement is subject to approval of our shareholders and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, and the transactions are expected to be completed late in the second quarter or in the first half of the third quarter of 2021.
 
Domestication
 
Prior to the effective time of the First Merger (the “Effective Time”), we will domesticate (the “Domestication”) as a Delaware corporation in accordance with Section 388 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) and the applicable provisions of the Companies Act (2020 Revision) of the Cayman Islands (the “Companies Act”).
 
In connection with the Domestication, (a) our Class A ordinary shares will convert automatically, on a one-for-one basis, into shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), (b) our Class B ordinary shares will convert automatically, on a one-for-one basis, into shares of Class A Common Stock, (c) our warrants to purchase Class A ordinary shares will convert automatically into warrants to purchase Class A Common Stock (d) our Units will convert automatically into units presenting one share of Class A Common Stock and one-fourth of one redeemable warrant; (e) a dual class structure will be implemented and we will be authorized to issue shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class B Common Stock”) that will carry voting rights in the form of ten votes per such share; and (f) we will immediately be renamed Volta Inc. upon the Effective Time.

Stockholder Support Agreement
 
In connection with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, we entered into a Stockholder Support Agreement (the “Stockholder Support Agreement”) with Volta and certain shareholders of Volta pursuant to which such shareholders agreed to vote all of their shares of Volta’s Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Volta Class A Common Stock”) and shares of Volta’s Class B common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Volta Class B Common Stock” and, together with the Volta Class A Common Stock, the “Volta Common Stock”) and shares of Volta’s preferred stock (“Volta Preferred Stock”) in favor of the approval and adoption of the Proposed Transactions, including agreeing to execute a written consent within forty-eight hours of a registration statement on Form S-4 filed by us becoming effective. Additionally, such shareholders have agreed, among other things, not to, prior to the Effective Time (a) transfer any of their shares of Volta Common Stock and Volta Preferred Stock (or enter into any arrangement with respect thereto), subject to certain customary exceptions or (b) enter into any voting arrangement that is inconsistent with the Stockholder Support Agreement.
 
Lock-Up Agreement
 
In connection with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, the founders of Volta entered into a Lock-Up Agreement (the “Lock-Up Agreement”) with us and Volta pursuant to which they have agreed, subject to certain customary exceptions, not to effect any (a) direct or indirect sale, assignment, pledge, hypothecation, disposition, loan or other transfer, or entry into any agreement with respect to any sale, assignment, pledge, hypothecation, disposition, loan or other transfer, with respect to any shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock held by them immediately after the Effective Time, including any shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of options or warrants to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock held by them immediately following the closing of the Proposed Transactions (the “BCA Closing”) or (b) publicly announce any intention to effect any transaction specified in clause (a), in each case, until the date that is the earlier of (i) one year after the BCA Closing and (ii) the earlier to occur of, subsequent to the BCA Closing, (x) the first date on which the last reported sale price of the Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as equitably adjusted for share sub-divisions, share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30 trading-day period commencing at least 150 days after the BCA Closing and (y) the date on which there is consummated a subsequent liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of our stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of Class A Common Stock for cash, securities or other property.
 
Our bylaws after the BCA Closing will include transfer restrictions on our securities issued to the investors of Volta in connection with the First Merger for a period of six (6) months after the BCA Closing.
 
Sponsor Letter
 
In connection with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, we entered into a letter agreement (the “Sponsor Letter”) with Volta, our Sponsor and the other holders of our Founder Shares pursuant to which, among other things, our Sponsor and each other holder agreed to (a) waive the anti-dilution rights set forth in Article 17.3 of the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, (b) comply with the non-solicitation provisions in the Business Combination Agreement, and (c) vote all of our shares held by them in favor of the adoption and approval of the Business Combination Agreement and the Proposed Transactions.
Subscription Agreements

In connection with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, we entered into separate subscription agreements (collectively, the “Subscription Agreements”) with a number of investors (each, a “Subscriber” and collectively, the “Subscribers”), pursuant to which the Subscribers agreed to purchase, and we agreed to sell to the Subscribers, an aggregate of 30,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock (the “Private Placement Shares”), for a purchase price of $10.00 per share and an aggregate purchase price of $300,000,000, in a private placement.

21
--


The closing of the sale of the Private Placement Shares pursuant to the Subscription Agreements will take place on the date of, and at a time immediately prior to or substantially concurrently with, the BCA Closing and is contingent upon, among other customary closing conditions, the consummation of the Proposed Transactions. The purpose of the Private Placement is to raise additional capital for use by the combined company following the BCA Closing.
 
Pursuant to the Subscription Agreements, we agreed that, within 30 calendar days after the consummation of the Proposed Transactions, we will file with the SEC (at our sole cost and expense) a registration statement registering the resale of the Private Placement Shares (the “Private Placement Resale Registration Statement”), and we shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Private Placement Resale Registration Statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof, but no later than the earlier of (i) 60 calendar days (or 90 calendar days if the SEC notifies us that it will review the Private Placement Resale Registration Statement) following the BCA Closing and (ii) the tenth business day after the SEC notifies us that the Private Placement Resale Registration Statement will not be reviewed or will not be subject to further review.
 
Employees
 
We currently have five officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
 
We have registered our Units, Class A ordinary shares and public warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
 
We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials (as applicable) sent to shareholders. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), or reconciled to, GAAP, or International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “PCAOB”). These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that any applicable requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
