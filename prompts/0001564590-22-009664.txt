Item 1. Business. 
Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage therapeutics company focused on developing our proprietary hypoxia-generated growth factor technology platform and stem cell-free biologic products as potential first-in-class restorative therapeutics that ignite the body’s natural process to repair and maintain healthy biological function. 
 Under our biologics technology platform, our product candidates in development are HST-003, a treatment for joint cartilage repair, and HST-004, a treatment for spinal disc repair.
 We also have a pipeline of clinical and preclinical small molecule pan-caspase and caspase selective inhibitors focused on treatments for infectious and inflammatory diseases that we intend to develop. We previously entered into a collaboration with Amerimmune LLC (“Amerimmune”) to lead the development activities for emricasan, a pan-caspase inhibitor, for the treatment of COVID-19. However, we believe that Amerimmune has breached its obligations under the Collaborative Development and Commercialization Agreement (the “Collaborative Agreement”) and based upon such breach, we filed a demand for an arbitration proceeding (the “Arbitration”) seeking a declaratory judgment that entitles us, amongst other remedies, to terminate the Collaborative Agreement. In the event that we are successful in having the Collaborative Agreement terminated for material breach, all rights and licenses granted to Amerimmune shall terminate, and all rights granted by us to Amerimmune revert back to us. In such event, we intend to independently develop emricasan for the treatment of COVID-19, and other infectious and inflammatory diseases. In the event that the Collaborative Agreement is not terminated as a result of the Arbitration, then we expect that we will continue to collaborate with Amerimmune pursuant to the terms of the Collaborative Agreement. We also intend to independently evaluate the use of the caspase selective inhibitors for inflammatory diseases.
 Our Technology and Product Candidates
 Our proprietary hypoxia-generated growth factor technology is based on the discovery that growing fibroblast cells under simulated embryonic conditions induces them to become multipotent with stem cell-like properties. The environment created by our proprietary process mimics the conditions within the womb — very low oxygen and suspension culture. When incubated under these conditions, the fibroblast cells generate biological materials, growth factors and proteins, that have the potential to stimulate a person’s own stem cells to activate and replace/regenerate damaged cells and tissue. Our proprietary manufacturing process provides targeted solutions that harness the body’s inherent regenerative power across a broad range of therapeutic indications including joint cartilage regeneration, spinal disc repair and tendon and other soft tissue repair.
 Our manufacturing process yields multiple biologic products from a single bioreactor, including cell conditioned medium (CCM) and human extracellular matrix (hECM), creating a spectrum of product candidates for a variety of markets from one core technology.
  
• | Human Multipotent Cell Conditioned Media, or CCM: A soluble multipotent CCM that is the starting material for products for skin care and other applications. The liquid complex produced through Histogen’s manufacturing process contains soluble biologicals with a diverse range of embryonic-like proteins. Because the cells produce and secrete these factors while developing the extracellular matrix, or ECM, these proteins are naturally secreted into the liquid media. The CCM contains a diverse mixture of cell-signaling materials, including human growth factors such as Keratinocyte Growth Factor, soluble human ECM proteins such as collagen, protease inhibitors to prevent the turn-over of ECM, and other vital proteins which support the stem cells that renew cells throughout life.

• | Human Extracellular Matrix, or hECM: An insoluble hECM for applications such as orthopedics and soft tissue augmentation, which can be fabricated into a variety of structural or functional forms for tissue engineering and clinical applications. The hECM produced through our proprietary process is a novel, all-human, naturally secreted and crosslinked material. It is most ECM present in similar to early embryonic structural tissue which provides the framework and signals necessary for cell in-growth and tissue development. By producing similar ECM materials to those that aided in the original formation of these tissues in the embryo, regenerative cells are supported in this structural microenvironment and have shown potential as therapeutics in vivo.

Under our biologics technology platform, our product candidates in development are HST-003, a treatment for joint cartilage repair, and HST-004, a treatment for spinal disc repair. In addition, within our small molecule pipeline, our product candidates include emricasan, CTS-2090 and CTS-2096. Currently, emricasan is being developed both jointly with our collaboration partner, Amerimmune, for the treatment of COVID-19, and we are evaluating the use of emricasan for other infectious diseases, including for the treatment of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (“MRSA”). We also have preclinical product candidates, CTS-2090 and CTS-2096, novel, potent, orally bioavailable, and highly selective small molecule inhibitors of caspase-1 designed for the treatment of certain inflammatory diseases.
 Biologics Technology Platform
  
• | HST-003 is a human extracellular matrix, or hECM, intended for regenerating hyaline cartilage for the treatment of articular cartilage defects in the knee, with a novel, malleable scaffold that stimulates the body’s own stem cells. In September 2020, we were awarded a $2.0 million grant by the Peer Reviewed Orthopaedic Research Program (“PRORP”) of the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) to partially fund a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of HST-003 for regeneration of cartilage in the knee. The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity, 820 Chandler Street, Fort Detrick MD, 21702, is the awarding and administering acquisition office. The views expressed in this filing are ours and may not reflect the official policy or position of the Department of the Army, Department of Defense, or the U.S. Government. In December 2020, we filed an investigational new drug application (“IND”) for the initiation of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HST-003, implanted within microfracture interstices and the cartilage defect in the knee to regenerate hyaline cartilage in combination with a microfracture procedure. In January 2021, we announced that the FDA had notified the company that the IND for the planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial of HST-003 was placed on clinical hold. The hold was due to additional chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (“CMC”) information required for the FDA to complete their review. Following the receipt of the written clinical hold letter on February 3, 2021, we submitted a complete response letter to the FDA on February 19, 2021. In March 2021, the FDA confirmed that Histogen had satisfactorily addressed all clinical hold questions and could proceed with initiation of the planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial of HST-003. In June 2021, we initiated the trial and to date have had patient recruitment challenges due to the specific nature of the study inclusion criteria and the impact of COVID-19 on the elective surgery environment. Additional qualified clinical sites have been added to help supplement recruitment and we will continue to evaluate the need to add more sites and study resources. We now anticipate top line results in the first half of 2023 assuming we complete enrollment in the fourth quarter of 2022.

• | HST-004 is a CCM solution intended to be administered through an intradiscal injection for spinal disc repair. Initial preclinical research has shown that the growth- and repair-factor enriched HST-004 stimulates stem cells from the spinal disc to proliferate and secrete aggrecan and collagen II, regenerate normal matrix and cell tissue structure, and restore disc height. HST-004 was also shown to both reduce inflammation and protease activity and upregulate aggrecan production in an ex vivo spinal disc model. In the second quarter of 2021, we initiated IND enabling activities for HST-004. However, due to pipeline program prioritization, we would not expect to make an IND filing for HST-004 until the second half of 2023.

CCM Skin Care Ingredient 
  
• | We have also developed a non-prescription topical skin care ingredient utilizing CCM that we believe harnesses the power of growth factors and other cell signaling molecules to support our epidermal stem cells, which renew skin throughout life. The CCM ingredient for skin care is licensed to Allergan PLC (“Allergan”), who formulates the ingredient into their skin care product lines.

Small Molecule Pipeline
  
• | Emricasan is an orally available pan-caspase inhibitor currently being developed both in collaboration with Amerimmune, for the treatment of COVID-19, and we are evaluating the use of emricasan for other infectious diseases, including for the treatment of MRSA. In October 2020, we entered into the Collaborative Agreement with Amerimmune. Under the Collaborative Agreement, during the agreed upon research term, Amerimmune, at its own expense and in collaboration with us, is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to lead the development activities for emricasan, limited to the treatment of COVID-19. We believe

that, for numerous reasons set forth in our demand for arbitration (“Arbitration Demand”), Amerimmune has failed to undertake commercially reasonable efforts towards the development of emricasan as required by the Collaborative Agreement. Therefore, we are currently seeking, amongst other remedies, a declaratory judgment that Amerimmune has materially breached the Collaborative Agreement. In which case, we would be entitled to terminate the Collaborative Agreement thereby terminating all rights and licenses granted to Amerimmune by us, and we would then independently proceed with the development of emricasan for the treatment of COVID-19 and other infectious and inflammatory diseases. At this time, we continue to operate under the terms of the existing Collaborative Agreement for the joint development of emricasan for the treatment of COVID-19. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Prior to initiating the Arbitration Demand, we filed and received permission from the FDA for an IND to initiate a Phase 1 study of emricasan in mild COVID-19 patients to assess safety and tolerability.  In June 2021, we along with our partner, Amerimmune, announced top line results from the Phase 1 study of emricasan in mild symptomatic COVID-19 patients to assess safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy. The study demonstrated that emricasan was safe and well-tolerated during the 14 days of dosing and at the day 45 follow-up, as compared to placebo with no reports of serious adverse events. Patients who completed treatment with emricasan had a complete resolution of the symptoms most commonly associated with mild COVID-19, such as cough, headache, and fatigue at day 7 and continued through day 45. No patients in the placebo arm who completed the study experienced COVID-19 associated symptom resolution at any time point out to day 14. Some of the placebo patients did have COVID-19 symptom resolution at day 30 while others experienced symptoms that persisted at day 45. A total of 13 subjects were consented and randomized to receive either placebo or 25 mg emricasan orally, BID for 14 days. PK samples, taken at day 14 of the study to check for compliance, revealed that one patient in the treatment arm did not show any indications of emricasan or its known metabolites in plasma, leading to a reclassification of the patient for the subsequent analysis shown in Figure 1. Additionally, there were no serious adverse events reported, and the emricasan group had fewer adverse events compared to placebo; 33 vs 66%, respectively.  As compared with placebo, the proportional odds of having a worse score on an eight-level ordinal scale (persistence of a score of 3) with emricasan was 0.1 (95% CI, 0.006 to 1.544) at day 14 and 0.12 (95% CI, 0 to 3.41) at days 30 and 45.  The time to complete resolution of symptoms was shorter in the emricasan group compared to placebo (hazard ratio, 5.3, 95% CI, 1.005 to 27.9) (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Per-protocol analysis of time to complete resolution of symptoms. Symptoms were defined by the 14-point questionnaire recommended by the FDA for outpatient COVID-19 studies.  For the first 14 days, patients had daily tele-visits.  In-person follow up visits were conducted on days 14, 30 and 45. The Kaplan-Meier plots for time-to-recovery show faster recovery in patients treated with emricasan, with a median of 5 (interquartile range 4-6 days) vs 37 days (interquartile 
 5


range of 30-45) for participants randomized to the placebo group. The mean number of days to recovery for patients was 4.8 days with a SD=0.83 in the emricasan arm and 37.5 days, SD=8.2 in the placebo arm (p=0.001).
 We believe that Amerimmune has failed to undertake commercially reasonable efforts toward conducting and completing the Phase 2 study as required by the Collaborative Agreement.  As part of our Arbitration Demand, we have asked the arbitrator to terminate Collaborative Agreement so that we can conduct and complete the Phase 2 study independently.  There can be no assurances that the Arbitration Demand will result in our favor and terminate the Collaborative Agreement.  If the Collaborative Agreement is not terminated, we will likely continue to jointly develop emricasan pursuant to the terms of the Collaborative Agreement.  In either case, we anticipate a Phase 2 study could be initiated in the second half of 2022.  
 Independently, we are exploring the feasibility of testing emricasan in animal studies of other infectious diseases, initially focused on MRSA. We anticipate completing the feasibility assessment in the second half of 2022.  
  
• | CTS-2090 and CTS-2096 are selective caspase-1 inhibitors targeting inflammasome activation and have potential to intervene in a variety of inflammation mediated diseases. In our internal small molecule program, we have assembled a proprietary portfolio of orally active molecules that inhibit inflammasome pathways and thus the activation of the potent inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β, or IL-1β. Inhibition of IL-1β is a clinically validated approach to treating inflammatory diseases, with injectable biologic products using that mechanism of action already on the market. The NLRP3 inflammasome pathway, for example, is dependent upon caspase-1, which activates IL-1β. As such, caspase-1 occupies a uniquely central position in the inflammasome pathway, and we have leveraged our scientific expertise in caspase research and development to design potent, selective and orally bioavailable inhibitors of caspase-1. Excess IL-1β has been linked to a variety of diseases including rare genetic inflammatory diseases, cancer, liver and other gastrointestinal diseases, and cardiovascular diseases.

 Our caspase-1 pipeline include preclinical product candidates CTS-2090 and CTS-2096.  The selection of product candidate, CTS-2090, as a lead compound is based on its preclinical profile, including high selectivity for caspase-1, and drug-like properties showing a high degree of drug exposure in the intestinal track after oral administration. Similarly, we intend to evaluate CTS-2096, as an additional caspase-1 inhibitor drug candidate, and are in the process of exploring its drug like properties.
 Merger
 On January 28, 2020, the Company, then operating as Conatus, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, as amended (the “Merger Agreement”), with privately-held Histogen Inc. (“Private Histogen”) and Chinook Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Conatus (“Merger Sub”). Under the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Private Histogen, with Private Histogen surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”). On May 26, 2020, the Merger was completed.  Conatus changed its name to Histogen Inc., and Private Histogen, which remains as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, changed its name to Histogen Therapeutics Inc. On May 27, 2020, the combined company’s common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “HSTO.”
 Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of Private Histogen common stock outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Merger was converted into approximately 0.14342 shares of Company common stock (the “Exchange Ratio”), after taking into account the Reverse Stock Split, as described in Note 1 in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. Immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, all shares of Private Histogen preferred stock then outstanding were exchanged into shares of common stock of Private Histogen. In addition, all outstanding options exercisable for common stock of Private Histogen and warrants exercisable for common stock of Private Histogen became options and warrants exercisable for the same number of shares of common stock of the Company multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. Immediately following the Merger, stockholders of Private Histogen owned approximately 71.3% of the outstanding common stock of the combined company.

Market and Commercial Opportunity 
 We currently have multiple product candidates in development intended to address what we believe to be underserved, multibillion-dollar global markets, HST-003, a treatment for joint cartilage repair, and HST-004, a treatment for spinal disc repair, and emricasan, being currently developed jointly with Amerimmune, for the treatment of COVID-19, and we are evaluating the use of emricasan for other infectious diseases, including for the treatment of MRSA, and our other preclinical product candidates, CTS-2090 and CTS-2096.
Strategic Agreements 
 Amerimmune Collaborative Development and Commercialization Agreement
 In October 2020, we entered into a Collaborative Agreement with Amerimmune to jointly develop emricasan for the potential treatment of COVID-19. The FDA approved an investigational new drug application (“IND”) to initiate a Phase 1 study of emricasan in mild COVID-19 patients to assess safety and tolerability in 2020. Under the Collaborative Agreement, during the agreed upon research term, Amerimmune, at its own expense and in collaboration with us, is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to lead the development activities for emricasan, limited to the treatment of COVID-19. We believe that, for numerous reasons set forth in our arbitration demand, Amerimmune has failed to undertake commercially reasonable efforts towards the development of emricasan as required by the Collaborative Agreement. Therefore, we are currently seeking to terminate the Collaborative Agreement and independently proceed with the development of emricasan for the treatment of COVID-19 and other infectious and inflammatory diseases.  At this time, we continue to operate under the terms of the existing Collaborative Agreement for the joint development of emricasan for the treatment of COVID-19.   
 Pursuant to the terms of the Collaborative Agreement, each party shall retain ownership of their legacy intellectual property and responsibility for ongoing patent application prosecution and maintenance costs, and will jointly own any intellectual property developed during the term of the agreement. In addition, we granted Amerimmune an exclusive option, subject to terms and conditions including completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial by Amerimmune during the research term, to obtain an exclusive license that, if granted by us, allows Amerimmune alone, or in conjunction with one or more strategic partners, to use its commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture, and commercialize emricasan and other caspase modulators, including CTS-2090 and CTS-2096, and we will share the profits equally with Amerimmune. No consideration will be transferred to us until profits, as defined in the Amerimmune Agreement, are generated by Amerimmune from developing or commercializing products.
 On January 19, 2022, we provided a notice of material breach in connection with Amerimmune’s non-performance under the Collaborative Agreement and, on March 3, 2022, we filed the Arbitration Demand. During the arbitration, both Amerimmune and us continue to support planning of a Phase 2 trial of emricasan for the treatment of COVID-19. As part of our Arbitration Demand, we  are seeking a declaratory judgment that Amerimmune has materially breached the Collaborative Agreement, and we are therefore entitled to terminate the Collaborative Agreement. In the event of termination for material breach, all rights and licenses granted to Amerimmune by us shall terminate, and any and all rights granted by us to Amerimmune revert to Histogen. If we are successful, we would regain full rights to emricasan and other caspase modulators, including CTS-2090 and CTS-2096. In that case, we intend to develop emricasan for COVID-19 and other infectious and inflammatory diseases independently. There can be no assurances that the Arbitration Demand will result in our favor and terminate the Collaborative Agreement.  If the Collaborative Agreement is not terminated, we will likely continue to jointly develop emricasan pursuant to the terms of the Collaborative Agreement.  
 We have identified multiple promises to deliver goods and services, which include at the inception of the agreement: (i) a license to technology and patents, information, and know-how; (ii) supply of emricasan and (iii) collaboration, including our participation in a Joint Development Committee and Joint Partnering Committee. At inception and through December 31, 2021, we have identified one performance obligation for all the deliverables under the Amerimmune Agreement since the delivered elements are either not capable of being distinct or are not distinct within the context of the contract. No upfront consideration was exchanged between the parties and any consideration received will be dependent on the successful execution of a qualifying strategic partnership, as defined, on the successful commercialization of emricasan, or upon a change in control of Amerimmune, as defined.  Although we will recognize revenue upon the occurrence of one of these events, no such events have occurred as of December 31, 2021.

Allergan License and Supply Agreements 
 In July 2017, we and Allergan entered into a letter agreement to transfer Suneva Medical, Inc.’s Amended and Restated License and Supply Agreements (collectively the “Allergan Agreements”) to Allergan, which grants exclusive rights to commercialize our CCM skin care ingredient worldwide, excluding South Korea, China, and India, in exchange for royalty payments to us based on Allergan’s sales of product including the licensed ingredient. Through December 31, 2020, we entered into several amendments to the Allergan Agreements to, among other things, expand Allergan’s license rights, identify exclusive and non-exclusive fields of use, and clarify responsibilities related to regulatory filings. For these amendments to the License Agreements, we have received cash payments of $19.5 million through December 31, 2021. The Allergan Agreements also include a potential future milestone payment of $5.5 million if Allergan’s net sales of products containing our CCM skin care ingredient exceeds $60 million in any calendar year through December 31, 2027.
 From time to time, we may improve our CCM skin care ingredient, and to the extent that these are within the field of use in the Allergan Agreements, we will provide the improvements to Allergan. The remaining performance obligations related to the Allergan Agreements from 2017 were our obligations to supply CCM and provide potential future improvements to Allergan, for which our obligation to supply CCM was satisfied during the fourth quarter of 2019.
 On January 17, 2020, the Company and Allergan amended the Allergan Agreements, further clarifying the fields of use, the product definition, and rights to certain improvements, as well as us agreeing to supply additional CCM in 2020 and provide further technical assistance to Allergan (the cost of which was reimbursed to the Company), for a one-time payment of $1.0 million. Our obligation to supply additional CCM to Allergan was satisfied during the first quarter of 2021.
 Allergan may terminate the agreement for convenience upon one business days’ notice to us. Under the Amended and Restated License Agreement, as amended, Allergan will indemnify the Company for third-party claims arising from Allergan’s breach of the agreement, negligence or willful misconduct, or the exploitation of products by Allergan or its sublicensees. We will indemnify Allergan for third-party claims arising from our breach of the agreement, negligence or willful misconduct, or the exploitation of products by us prior to the effective date.
 PUR 
 In April 2019, Private Histogen entered into a Settlement, Release and Termination Agreement (“PUR Settlement”) with PUR Biologics, LLC and its members which terminated the License, Supply and Operating Agreements between Private Histogen and PUR, eliminated Private Histogen’s membership interest in PUR, and returned all in-process research and development assets to Private Histogen (the “Development Assets”). The agreement also provided indemnifications and complete releases by and among the parties. The acquisition of the Development Assets was accounted for as an asset acquisition in accordance with ASC 805-50-50, Acquisition of Assets Rather than a Business.
 As consideration for the reacquisition of the Development Assets, Private Histogen compensated PUR with both equity and cash components, including 167,323 shares of Series D convertible preferred stock with a fair value of $1.75 million and a potential cash payout of up to $6.25 million (the “Cap Amount”). Private Histogen paid PUR $0.5 million in upfront cash, forgave approximately $22 thousand of accounts receivable owed by PUR to Private Histogen, and settled an outstanding payable of PUR of approximately $23 thousand owed to a third party. The Company is also obligated to make milestone and royalty payments, including (a) a $0.4 million payment upon the unconditional acceptance and approval of a New Drug Application or Pre-Market Approval Application by the US FDA related to the Development Assets, (b) a $0.4 million commercialization milestone upon reaching gross sales (by the Company or licensee) of $0.5 million of products incorporating the Development Assets, and (c) a five percent (5%) royalty on net revenues collected by Histogen from commercial sales (by the Company or licensee) of products incorporating the Development Assets, limited to orthopedic product candidates developed using our biologics technology platform, including HST-003 and HST-004. The aforementioned cash payments, along with any future milestone and royalty payments, are all applied against the Cap Amount. In accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies, amounts for the milestone and royalty payments will be recognized when it is probable that the related contingent liability has been incurred and the amount owed is reasonably estimated. No amounts for the milestone and royalty payments have been recorded as a contingent liability at December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Governmental Regulation
 FDA Regulation and Marketing Approval
 In the U.S., the FDA regulates active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), drug products, biological products, and medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, and other federal regulations. These FDA-regulated products are also subject to state and local statutes and regulations, as well as applicable laws or regulations in foreign countries, as applicable. The FDA, and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries, impose substantial requirements on the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record-keeping, approval, post-approval monitoring, advertising, promotion, marketing, sampling and import and export of FDA-regulated products. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the drug development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions or non-approval of product candidates. These sanctions could include a clinical hold on clinical trials, FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications or related supplements, withdrawal of an approval, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, restitution, disgorgement, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Such actions by government agencies could also require us to expend a large number of resources to respond to the actions. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 IND and Clinical Trials of Drug and Biological Products
 Prior to commencing a human clinical trial of a drug or biological product, an IND application, which contains the results of preclinical studies along with other information, such as information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed protocol, must be submitted to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug or biological product to humans. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA within the 30-day time period raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial. In such a case, the IND sponsor must resolve any outstanding concerns with the FDA before the clinical trial may begin. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial to be conducted during drug development.
 An independent Institutional Review Board (IRB) for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the investigational plan for the trial before it commences at that site. Informed written consent must be obtained from each trial subject.
 Human clinical trials for drug and biological products typically are conducted in sequential phases that may overlap:
  
• | Phase I—the investigational drug/biologic is given initially to healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition in order to determine metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans, side effects and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase I clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational drug/biologic’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase II clinical trials.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase II—clinical trials are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug/biologic for a particular indication or in a limited number of patients in the target population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the drug/biologic for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase II clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase III clinical trials.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase III—when Phase II clinical trials demonstrate that a dosage range of the drug/biologic appears effective and has an acceptable safety profile, and provide sufficient information for the design of Phase III clinical trials, Phase III clinical trials in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical sites may begin. They are intended to further evaluate dosage, effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug/biologic and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling and approval by the FDA. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase III clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations, including good clinical practice (GCP) requirements, which are intended to protect the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants, define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors and ensure clinical trial data integrity. Regulatory authorities, including the FDA, an IRB, a data safety monitoring board or the sponsor, may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements.
 During the development of a new drug or biologic, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND (pre-IND), at the end of Phase II clinical trials (End-of-Phase (EOP) II), and before an NDA/BLA (pre-NDA/BLA) is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested (Type A or C meetings). These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the EOP II meeting(s) to discuss their Phase II clinical trials results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase III registration trial that they believe will support approval of the new drug/biologic. 
 An investigational drug product that is a combination of two different drugs in the same dosage form or a combination of a drug/biologic with a device must comply with an additional rule that requires that each component make a contribution to the claimed effects of the drug product/combination device. This typically requires larger studies that test the drug against each of its components.
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, biologics, and devices, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial, is made public as part of the registration. Sponsors also are obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the clinical trial results can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
The New Drug Application (NDA) Approval Process
 Our drug products must be approved by the FDA through the NDA approval process before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. The process required by the FDA before drugs may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:

• | completion of non-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to good laboratory practice or other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission of an IND application;
--+----------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use or uses conducted in accordance with GCP;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and audit of clinical trial sites; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA approval of an NDA.
--+------------------------

 In order to obtain approval to market a drug in the U.S., a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug for the proposed indication. Each NDA submission requires a substantial user fee payment unless a waiver or exemption applies. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent non-clinical studies, or preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other information. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a 
 10


use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators that meet GCP requirements.
 Companies also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for the NDA sponsor’s manufacturing the product in compliance with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate, and the manufacturer must develop and validate methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the API and drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf-life.
 The results of drug development, non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product.
 The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to conduct an initial review to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing.
 If the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with CGMPs to ensure the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA has agreed to specific performance goals on the review of NDAs and seeks to review standard NDAs within 12 months from submission. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late submitted information or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA, it will issue either an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or effectiveness to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving an NDA, BLA or PMA, the FDA typically will inspect the facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with CGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. We currently have manufacturing facilities at our corporate headquarters; however, we intend to facilitate a technology transfer of such functions and obligations to a third-party contract development manufacturing organization, for its clinical materials, and certain of its commercial partners for their commercial supply. Until such time as we no longer manufacture any clinical or commercial supply of product, we must ensure that our facilities satisfy FDA manufacturing requirements. Additionally, before approving an NDA, BLA or PMA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites for compliance with GCP regulations.
 If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies and often will request additional testing or information. This may significantly delay further review of the application. If the FDA finds that a clinical site did not conduct the clinical trial in accordance with GCP regulations, the FDA may determine the data generated by the clinical site should be excluded from the primary efficacy analyses provided in the NDA. Additionally, notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 11


As a condition of approval, the FDA may require, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called Phase IV or post-approval clinical trials may be a condition for continuing drug approval. The results of Phase IV clinical trials can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information. In addition, the FDA now has express statutory authority to require sponsors to conduct post-marketing trials to specifically address safety issues identified by the agency.
 The FDA also has authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. A sponsor may also voluntarily propose a REMS as part of the NDA submission. The need for a REMS is determined as part of the review of the NDA. Elements of a REMS may include “dear doctor letters,” a medication guide, more elaborate targeted educational programs, and in some cases elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”), which is the most restrictive REMS. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. These elements are negotiated as part of the NDA approval, and in some cases the approval date may be delayed. Once implemented, REMS are subject to periodic assessment and modification.
 Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, manufacturing processes or facilities, may require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing original NDAs.
 Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages, or might contain significant limitations on use in the form of warnings, precautions or contraindications, or in the form of onerous risk management plans, restrictions on distribution or post-marketing trial requirements. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Delay in obtaining, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval for our products, or obtaining approval but for significantly limited use, would harm our business. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products in development. In addition, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future U.S. or foreign governmental action.
 The Hatch-Waxman Amendments
 Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, as amended, commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, a portion of a product’s U.S. patent term that was lost during clinical development and regulatory review by the FDA may be restored. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments also provide a process for listing patents pertaining to approved products in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (commonly known as the Orange Book) and for a competitor seeking approval of an application that references a product with listed patents to make certifications pertaining to such patents. In addition, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments provide for a statutory protection, known as non-patent exclusivity, against the FDA’s acceptance or approval of certain competitor applications.
Patent Term Restoration
 Patent term restoration can compensate for time lost during drug development and the regulatory review process by returning up to five years of patent life for a patent that covers a new product or its use. This period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND (falling after issuance of the patent) and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, provided the sponsor acted with diligence. Patent term restorations, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.

Orange Book Listing
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed by the NDA holder in the drug’s application or otherwise are published in the FDA’s Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA). An ANDA permits marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredient(s) in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical studies or clinical trials to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved under and ANDA are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
 Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA provides an alternate regulatory pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved drug products. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference.
 Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (i) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (ii) such patent has expired; (iii) the date on which such patent expires; or (iv) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant also may elect to submit a “section viii” statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the reference NDA holder and patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired.
 Market Exclusivity
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain drug applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a Paragraph IV certification.
 The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, were conducted or sponsored by the applicant deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active ingredient. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA is required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the non-clinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 13


The Biologics License Application (BLA) Approval Process
 Our biological products must be approved by the FDA through the BLA approval process before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. The process is similar to the NDA process and generally involves the completion of non-clinical laboratory tests, submission of an IDA application, performance of human clinical trials in accordance with GCP to establish and safety and efficacy of the biological product, submission to the FDA of a BLA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials, FDA pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and audit of clinical trial sites; and FDA approval of a BLA.
 The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. Each BLA submission requires a user fee payment unless a waiver or exemption applies. The manufacturer or sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to annual establishment fees.
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of BLAs. Most applications for standard review biologics products are reviewed within twelve months of submission, and most applications for priority review biologics are reviewed within eight months of submission. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
 The FDA may also refer applications for novel biologics products or biologics products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the BLA unless compliance with CGMP is satisfactory, and the BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the biologic is safe and effective for the indication studied. Manufacturers of biologics also must comply with the FDA’s general rules on biological products.
 After the FDA evaluates the BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, including additional large-scale clinical testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing and distribution of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy and may impose other conditions, including labeling restrictions, which can materially affect the product’s potential market and profitability. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained, or problems or safety issues are identified following initial marketing.
 Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, device components or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. A BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing BLA supplements as it does in reviewing original BLAs.
 14


Biosimilar Exclusivity
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA) creates an abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilar products. A biosimilar is a biological product that is highly similar to and has no clinically meaningful differences from an existing FDA-licensed reference product. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and at least one clinical study, absent a waiver. A biosimilar product may be deemed interchangeable with a prior licensed product if it is biosimilar and meets additional requirements under the BPCIA, including that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. An interchangeable product may be substituted for the reference product without the involvement of the prescriber.
 A reference biologic is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product, and no application for a biosimilar may be submitted for four years from the date of licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product may obtain exclusivity against a finding of interchangeability for other biologics for the same condition of use for the lesser of (i) one year after first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar; (ii) eighteen months after the first interchangeable biosimilar is approved if there is no patent challenge; (iii) eighteen months after resolution of a lawsuit over the patents of the reference biologic in favor of the first interchangeable biosimilar applicant; or (iv) 42 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar’s application has been approved if a patent lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
 Post-Marketing Requirements for FDA Regulated Products
 Following approval of a new product, the company and the approved products are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, state and foreign regulatory authorities including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting adverse experiences to the applicable regulatory authorities, providing regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, manufacturing products in accordance with CGMP requirements, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising and restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not consistent with the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet, including social media. Although physicians may prescribe products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Modifications or enhancements to the product or its labeling or changes of the site of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, who may or may not grant approval, or may include in a lengthy review process.
 The FDA, state and foreign regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA, state or foreign regulatory authorities (as applicable), which may include the following:
  
• | untitled letters or warning letters;
--+-------------------------------------


• | fines, disgorgement, restitution or civil penalties;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions (e.g., total or partial suspension of production) or consent decrees;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product recalls, administrative detention, or seizure;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | customer notifications or repair, replacement or refunds;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | delays in or refusal to grant requests for future product approvals or foreign regulatory approvals of new products, new intended uses, or modifications to existing products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | withdrawals or suspensions of FDA product marketing approvals or foreign regulatory approvals, resulting in prohibitions on product sales;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | clinical holds on clinical trials;
--+-----------------------------------

 15



 
• | FDA refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

 Any of these sanctions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Such actions by government agencies could also require us to expend a large amount of resources to respond to the actions. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 In the U.S., after a product is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by the FDA. The FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in registered facilities and in accordance with CGMP. We expect to rely on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with CGMP regulations. CGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct deviations from CGMP. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs, biologics and medical devices are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with CGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain CGMP compliance.
 NDA/BLA/PMA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms and, in certain circumstances, suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to CGMP, could result in enforcement actions that can interrupt the operation of any such firm or result in restrictions on product supply, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market.
 Newly-discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures.
 Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 Sales of our product candidates, if approved, or any other future product candidate will be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we might conduct our business. The healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include the following:

• | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is in exchange for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value untitled letters or warning letters;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Federal false claims and false statement laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors or making any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors or making any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 and their implementing regulations, impose obligations on certain types of individuals and entities regarding the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Also, many states have similar laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, we may be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the federal government’s and/or pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines, state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, as well as state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA.
 Additionally, to the extent that our product is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
 Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls
 For our biologics technology platform product candidates, we have successfully developed production processes that are scalable. All of the derivatives of the manufacturing process can be used, creating a spectrum of products for a variety of markets from one core technology.
 We have established in-house research, development and manufacturing capabilities in our corporate headquarters. We intend to secure manufacturing agreements with a contract manufacturing organization for our own clinical and commercial supply. Currently, we are not a party to any manufacturing agreements.
 For our small molecule pipeline product candidates, we have successfully developed production processes that are scalable and economically viable. We have used contract manufacturing organizations for our own preclinical and clinical supply. Currently, we are not a party to any manufacturing agreements. 
 Intellectual Property
 As of February 1, 2022, we hold or control 13 issued U.S. patents, 9 pending U.S. patent applications, and 61 patents in various jurisdictions outside the United States related to our biologics and small molecule product candidates and core biologics technology. Additionally, we are pursuing 37 corresponding patent applications that are pending in various foreign jurisdictions. Further advancement of our intellectual property portfolio will require the filing of patent applications related to our proprietary manufacturing process and product candidates. We have patents extending into the late 2020s, and 2030 related to our biologics technology platform product candidates, and late 2020s, and early 2040 related to our small molecule product candidates, as well as trade secrets protecting our intellectual property. Our patent prosecution strategy includes exploration of opportunities to expand our patent life in order to broaden our existing patent portfolio.

• | one patent issued in the United States (U.S. Patent Nos. 8,535,913), which is also directed to the production and use of extracellular matrix compositions and more specifically to proteins obtained by culturing cells under hypoxic conditions on a surface in a suitable growth medium useful for promoting hair growth. This U.S. patent relates to HST-001 and it is expected to expire in January 30, 2029;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | two patents issued in the United States (U.S. Patent Nos. 8,530,415 and 9,512,403), which are also directed to the production of a tissue patch for the repair and regeneration of cells and methods of use using of extracellular matrix compositions and more specifically to proteins obtained by culturing cells under hypoxic conditions on microcarrier beads or a three-dimensional a surface in a suitable growth medium. These U.S. patents relate to HST-003, HST-004 and HST-005 and are expected to expire January to March 2029; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | six patents issued in the United States (U.S. Patent Nos. 8,852,637, 9,034,312, 9,506,038, 10,143,708, 10,675,303, 11,191,780) and fourteen patents issued in foreign jurisdictions related to extracellular matrix compositions for the treatment of cancer, which are scheduled to expire between January 2029 and November 2030, while patents issued in foreign jurisdictions are expected to expire in January 2029; and one pending U.S. application related to skin care.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, the following is a further description of certain of our key issued patents and pending applications related to our small molecule product candidates, including composition of matter coverage, method of protection, expiration date, number of related patents issued/pending in foreign jurisdictions and the product candidates to which each patent/application relates. We currently hold or control:
  
• | one patent issued in the United States (U.S. Patent No. 7,692,038) and twenty patents issued in foreign jurisdictions directed to the crystalline forms of emricasan. We expect that the crystalline forms and methods of use patent, if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, will expire in July 2028 (United States) and December 2027 (international). It is possible that the term of a crystalline forms patent in the United States could be extended up to five additional years under the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act.

Wherever possible, we seek to protect our inventions by filing U.S. patents as well as foreign counterpart applications in select other countries. Because patent applications in the U.S. are maintained in secrecy for at least eighteen months after the applications are filed, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for protection of inventions set forth in such patent applications. Our planned or potential products may be covered by third-party patents or other intellectual property rights, in which case continued development and marketing of its products would require a license. Required licenses may not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. If we do not obtain these licenses, we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to design around the patents, or we could find that the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses are not possible.
 In addition to patent protection, we also rely on know-how, trade secrets and the careful monitoring of proprietary information, all of which can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect some of our proprietary technology and processes by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, and contractors. These agreements may be breached, we may not have adequate remedies for any breach and our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees or our consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may also arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
 Competition
 The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and experience in research and development, manufacturing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing products.
 While we believe our biologics technology platform and our small molecule pipeline focus on addressing underserved, multibillion-dollar global markets, in-house research and development, knowledge, experience, and scientific resources offer competitive advantages, we face competition in the biopharmaceutical industry. The key competitive factors affecting the success of HST-003, HST-004 and emricasan are successful completion of clinical trials and timely regulatory approval in markets worldwide.
 HST-003
 Competition in the pharmaceutical market for regenerating hyaline cartilage for the treatment of articular cartilage defects, consists of the following:
  
• | Physicians, and their patients, are seeking treatments that reverse cartilage degeneration.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Less invasive procedures are preferred to preserve patient function and reduce surgical complications.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Patients seek treatment options with shorter recovery periods and lasting treatment mechanisms that can promote more durable articular cartilage healing.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Current treatment options fall into four key therapeutics categories, opioid, analgesic, cell/stem cell or disease modifying.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cartilage repair products currently on the market or in active clinical development include: Collegium’s COL003, Adhera’s IT-102, Cytori’s adipose derived stem cells, Stempeucetics’ Stempeucel, Samumed’s SM-04690 and Medivir AB’s MIV-711.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 HST-004
 Competition in the pharmaceutical market for spinal disc repair treatment consists of the following:
  
• | Physicians, and their patients, are seeking treatments that reverse spinal disc degeneration after injury.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 19



 
• | Less invasive procedures are preferred to preserve patient function and reduce surgical complications that are common with such surgeries as spinal disc fusions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Patients seek treatment options when surgical procedures with fixation devices may not be clinically appropriate or earlier in the disease progression.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Current treatment options fall into four key therapeutics categories, opioid, analgesic, cell/stem cell or disease modifying.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Spinal disc repair products currently in active clinical development include: autologous stem cell therapy (StemSpine, Novocart Disc, FibroGenesis), allogeneic cell therapy (Discogenics, Mallinkrodt) and a Wnt pathway inhibitor targeting CLK2/DYRK1A (Biosplice Therapeutics, formerly Samumed). 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Emricasan (COVID-19)
 Currently there is no competition in the pharmaceutical market for the treatment of COVID-19 using a commercially available, or available under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), pan-caspase inhibitor:

• | COVID-19 is a multiple system disease that affects the lungs, circulatory system, the brain, kidney and other organs. Patients show a widespread of severity, some which remain asymptomatic, and others that progress all the way to rapid health deterioration, including death due to organ failure.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | While vaccination can prevent or diminish infection, or in case of break-through infection diminish mortality when compared to unvaccinated individuals, the constantly evolving virus may evade immunosurveillance and cause more serious disease, thus warranting the development of treatments that directly combat the viral life cycle.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Patients that show greater morbidity and mortality are typically characterized by lymphopenia, a rapid decline in white blood cells. Preliminary studies indicate that lymphopenia is associated with more severe disease and outcomes. Emricasan targets multiple caspases including caspase-1 which is believed to be a key enzyme that when activated leads to lymphopenia.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Physicians, and their patients, are seeking treatment options that will shorten recovery periods and prevent progression of the disease and its severity.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Current non-vaccine treatment options fall into several therapeutic categories geared toward interfering with different aspects of the disease, including RNA polymerase inhibitors to prevent replication of the virus, general anti-inflammatory drugs, and monoclonal antibodies to interfere with cellular receptors to prevent uptake of the virus.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Currently, there are no caspase inhibitors on the market that are targeting the same mechanism of action, such as prevention of lymphopenia.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Other treatments which aim to interfere with different aspects of the disease that are currently on the market as FDA approved drugs, under a FDA EUA or in active clinical development include: Remdesivir/Veklury (approved RNApol inhibitor), Dexamethasone (corticosteroid, anti-inflammatory), Bamlanivimab (Lilly, anti-COVID mAbs), and Casirivmab/Imdevimab (Regeneron, anti-COVID mAbs), Bamlaniviman/etesevimab combination (Lilly, anti-COVID mAbs combination), baricitinib/remdesivir combination (Lilly; combination treatment of remdesivir with a janus kinase inhibitor). More recently, molnupiravir (Merck), a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor, and the PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir ritonavir® combination treatment; Pfizer), a potent inhibitor of the virus poly-protein processing protease, and Evusheld (viral spike-protein binding monoclonal antibody combination; AstraZeneca) have been approved by the FDA under an EUA and have demonstrated moderate to significantly effective reductions in hospitalizations if taken early. Others are Sotrovimab (viral spike-protein binding; GSK), Actemra (IL-6 receptor binding; Genentech).
 Emricasan (MRSA)
 Currently there is no direct competition in the pharmaceutical market for the treatment of MRSA using a pan-caspase inhibitor:
 20


 
• | MRSA causes hard to treat hospital and community acquired skin infections that can result in extended hospital stays and in significant instances lead to death, often due to bacteremia.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Last line antibiotics provide current treatment options that are eclipsed by MRSA strains developing antibiotic resistance against these antibiotics.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | MRSA and similar infections are characterized by a pathogenic modulation of the human immune system, leading to cell death of immune cells and an aberrant cytokine storm.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A recent published pre-clinical study establishes that modulating the host immune system with systemic administration of pan-caspase inhibitors, such as emricasan can lead to a reduction of MRSA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Currently, there are no FDA approved treatments of MRSA that target this novel mechanism of action.
