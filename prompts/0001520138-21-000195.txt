ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

Overview
 
Global Clean Energy Holdings, Inc. (“GCEH”) is a uniquely positioned renewable fuels company that is vertically integrated from farm to finished fuels. We differentiate ourselves by owning assets that anchor both ends of the cost and value chain, from plant sciences development, farming of plants for feedstocks, to the refining and distribution of renewable diesel and other renewable products. Our upstream assets consist of a portfolio of intellectual properties that we have developed over 14 years related to nonfood based crops that are dedicated to the production of renewable fuels. Our intellectual property includes patents in plant genetics, agronomics and cultivation know-how, and a number of strategic and targeted regulatory approvals. Our downstream business consists of a refinery in Bakersfield, California (the “Bakersfield Biorefinery”) that is currently being refurbished as a biorefinery, and marketing and distribution agreements for the renewable fuels that we will produce at our Bakersfield Biorefinery . We also have contracted for the use of key midstream assets for the separation, handling, consolidation, storage, and transportation of our Camelina based feedstock which will be used in the production of renewable fuels at the Bakersfield Biorefinery. This integrated farm-to-fuel platform is a core differentiator from our peer group.
 
Our strategy has been consistent since we began our biofuels business in 2007; control the full vertical integration of our supply chain from development and cultivation of ultra-low carbon nonfood based feedstocks, to the production and sale of the ultra-low carbon finished renewable fuel products. By sourcing our feedstocks directly from farmers, we control the quality and priority of production, eliminate the intermediaries and produce a true “cost-based” feedstock that is not subject to the supply limitations and uncertainties or the market volatility of food based feedstocks. As part of our business strategy, we have entered into strategic agreements along the entire supply chain, from plant genetics, crop production, transportation and logistics to the sale of our self-produced finished renewable fuel products. This strategy allows us to rapidly scale our business. One of our primary strategic partnerships is with ExxonMobil Oil Corporation, which provides us access to ExxonMobil’s world-wide wholesale and retail markets, to monetize the fuels produced at our Bakersfield Biorefinery.
 
The greatest challenge to the wide adoption of renewable fuels is the limited availability of the plant oils and animal fats that are the feedstock of renewable fuels. The feedstock represents between 75% and 85% of the cost of fuel production with the vast majority of all biofuels produced from a finite supply of food-based plant oils and grains, such as corn for ethanol, or soybean oil or animal fats for biodiesel, renewable diesel or renewable jet fuel. Our business model increases the total volume of feedstocks available in the market, which we will use in our own refinery, thereby reducing our costs. By utilizing our self-produced feedstock we will not be required to compete with other refineries for the finite amount of other food-based feedstocks.
 
Our integrated biofuels platform combines our internal plant science research and development with collaborations with leading public academic institutions, private researchers, farmers and cooperative partnerships for crop production, and other strategic relationships for product sales and distribution. Our intellectual property rights around feedstock production know-how are primarily held by Sustainable Oils, Inc. (“SusOils”), our wholly owned plant science agricultural subsidiary, and our renewable fuels production facility (the Bakersfield Biorefinery) that is owned by our Bakersfield Renewable Fuels, LLC subsidiary.

SusOils is a plant science, crop development company with an industry leading portfolio of intellectual property, regulatory approvals and deployment experience for novel varieties of Camelina sativa (“Camelina”). SusOils is engaged in the development of new and enhanced varieties of Camelina intended to advance key agronomic, genotype and phenotype attributes of the crop. SusOils currently holds 18 issued patents or pending patent applications. SusOils was also granted a first-of-its-kind feedstock-only pathway by the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) for the production of renewable fuels under the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (“LCFS”) produced from its proprietary Camelina varieties. No other Camelina-based feedstock has been approved by CARB under LCFS.
 
We are currently farming our enhanced proprietary varieties of Camelina which will be refined into renewable diesel (“RD”) and other renewable fuels at our Bakersfield Biorefinery. The RD will be sold through our relationship with ExxonMobil Oil Corporation.
 
Camelina is a fast-growing, low input crop traditionally grown in rotation with wheat and other row crops. Camelina allows farmers to improve total farm economics through better overall asset utilization. As a dryland farmed rotational crop, Camelina does not displace food or create indirect land use change, which makes it unique as an ultra-low carbon intensity feedstock.
 
GCEH acquired a crude oil refinery in Bakersfield California in May 2020 that is now owned by a GCEH wholly-owned subsidiary which owns Bakersfield Renewable Fuels, LLC (“BKRF”). BKRF’s crude oil refinery is being retooled and refurbished into a biorefinery which is expected to be completed in early 2022. Once complete, the Bakersfield Biorefinery will produce renewable diesel from both SusOils’ proprietary Camelina as well as a traditional slate of renewable feedstocks such as vegetable oils, waste fats, and greases. The Bakersfield Biorefinery will be the largest renewable fuels facility in the western United States, the second largest in the entire United States, and the largest in the country that produces renewable fuels from nonfood feedstocks. Our integrated farm-to-fuel supply chain differentiates us from most other biorefinery companies in the market today.

Summary of Recent Developments
 
SusOils Patent Applications. Since October 2020, our SusOils subsidiary has filed seven additional patent applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, consisting of six utility patent applications for new varieties of Camelina, and a provisional patent application for improved Camelina plant oil use and production. Since October 2020 SusOil has also applied for protection under the Plant Variety Protection Act (PVPA) for its six new Camelina varieties. These new applications are in addition to the issued patents on Camelina and other intellectual properties owned by SusOils. See, “Item 1. Business—Technology and Patents,” below.
 
Reverse Stock Split. As approved by its shareholders in November 2020, GCEH filed an amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation that on March 26, 2021 implemented a 1-for-10 reverse stock split of GCEH’s Common Stock. As a result of the reverse stock split, each ten shares of GCEH’s issued and outstanding Common Stock were automatically combined and converted into one share of Common Stock, without any change in par value per share. As a result of the stock split, the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on March 26, 2021 decreased from approximately 374,367,000 to approximately 37,437,000. The reverse stock split only affected the issued shares and did not change the total number of authorized shares. All Common Stock and per share information (other than par value) contained in this Annual Report has been adjusted to reflect the foregoing reverse stock split.
 
OTCQB Venture Market. On December 29, 2020, GCEH was notified by the OTC Markets that the GCEH shares were approved for trading on the OTCQB Venture Market. Accordingly, since the beginning of this year, GCEH’s shares of common stock have been trading on the OTCQB Venture Market.
 
Business Operations-Strategy
 
The Company’s overall business plan remains focused on the vertical integration of the complete biofuels supply chain. The foundation of this approach is to develop proprietary feedstock technology that sets us apart from the industry. Since the commencement of our renewable fuels business more than 14 years ago, we have been focused on the development and commercialization of feedstocks and feedstock-related intellectual property. Over the last three years we have been pursuing the final piece with the integration of a biorefinery. This integrated approach allows us to control our own feedstock cost and supply, produce additive feedstock volume into a structurally undersupplied market, and scale the business with margin protection and feedstock supply certainty.

A major factor limiting the adoption of renewable fuels is the limited availability of the plant oils and animal fats that are the feedstock of renewable fuels. Currently, most biofuels are produced from a finite supply of food-based plant oils or grains, and from animal fats. Our strategy is to produce a non-food based oil from our proprietary varieties of Camelina that is purpose grown by our contracted farmers for use in our own biorefinery. By contracting with third party farmers to produce extra feedstock for use in our own refinery, we will have the ability to control the cost, quality and the quantity of most of the feedstock to be used at the Bakersfield Biorefinery.
 
Our feedstock centric approach produces nonfood-based plant oils that are derived from plants grown on fallow land. The production of our Camelina feedstock does not limit or otherwise impact the production of food crops, but instead frees up land for food production that otherwise would be used to produce food crops (such as corn and soybeans) for biofuels.
 
Our path forward includes the further development of our technology to produce greater volumes of purpose grown feedstock, improved genetics to increase overall yield per acre, and improved plant oil chemistry to enhance biorefinery efficiency. Our integrated biofuels platform combines our internal plant science research and development with collaborations with leading public academic institutions, private researchers, farmers and cooperative partnerships for crop production, and other strategic relationships for product sales and distribution.
 
The integrated farm-to-fuel platform is data driven, scalable and a core differentiator from our peer group. Access to detailed data regarding all aspects of our farming process allows us to provide the data needed to certify the ultra-low carbon intensity of our fuels. By utilizing big data analytics across all aspects of our research and development, feedstock production, logistics, and processing (biorefining), we gain insights that provide opportunities to improve efficiencies and create other advantages compared to other feedstocks. Our focus is to directly impact the entire production process to reduce the carbon intensity of our fuels, reduce costs, and improve bottom line margins. The integrated and data driven platform will facilitate our goal of “Driving to Zero” across all areas of the business, in particular the carbon intensity of our fuels.
 
To further dis-intermediate the market for biofuels, following initial start-up of our biorefinery, we plan to co-locate agricultural and alternative energy technologies within our over 500 acre Bakersfield Biorefinery site by hosting both agricultural processing assets and biofuels production assets on the same site. When complete, this co-location strategy will be the first of its kind, allowing all the facilities to optimize operations, energy utilization, and logistics capacity directly in the market we serve. The co-location and integration of these systems should result in significant operating efficiencies, utility savings and other overall synergies across both the biorefinery and agricultural operations. Integrating these operations is expected to lower our cost of production while generating higher value, lower carbon products.
 
Acquisition and Financing of Bakersfield Renewable Diesel Biorefinery
 
On May 7, 2020 we acquired an existing crude oil refinery in Bakersfield, California (the “Refinery Acquisition”). As described elsewhere in this Annual Report, we are currently retooling and upgrading the refinery’s existing infrastructure so it is capable of producing renewable diesel, a drop-in replacement for ultra-low sulfur diesel. The refinery will also produce renewable propane, renewable butane, and renewable naphtha. The Bakersfield Biorefinery is being developed to process up to approximately 15,000 barrels (630,000 gallons) per day of renewable feedstock into renewable diesel utilizing the Haldor Topsoe “HydroFlex” technology. At design capacity, the refinery is expected to produce approximately 210 million gallons per year of renewable diesel as well as other renewable co-products.
 
The Bakersfield refinery has over 80% of the equipment that is needed for the biorefinery on-site, including: a hydrogen plant; a hydrotreater; reactors; fired heaters; compressors; pumps; heat exchangers; and storage tanks capable of storing up to 2.7 million barrels of product. The site is fully permitted for grid power, natural gas, water treatment and disposal. The refinery also has in place much of the logistics the biorefinery will need, including a rail spur from the mainline of BNSF Railway Company’s freight railroad network, railcar facilities, pipelines and an 8-bay truck blending and loading rack. We are refurbishing or upgrading some of the equipment, including the hydrogen plant, equipment associated with the hydro-processing area, some of the storage tanks, and the automation controls. We are also making some infrastructure improvements to the rail system as well as the natural gas and other pipelines. In addition to improving and modernizing the existing equipment, we are also updating the reactors and adding additional process equipment for biorefining use. The engineering and construction of the project is expected to be completed in early 2022.

In connection with developing the new renewable fuels biorefinery, we licensed from Haldor Topsoe A/S certain proprietary processes, catalysts, and equipment designs for the hydroprocessing of natural feedstocks. We also engaged a national engineering, procurement and construction contracting firm as the primary contractor of the Bakersfield Biorefinery and other engineering firms for various refinery modifications.
 
In order to finance the costs of the Biorefinery Acquisition and the development, construction, and operation of the refinery, we entered into two credit facilities pursuant to which we can borrow up to a maximum aggregate amount of $365 million (the “Financing Transaction”). Since the Financing Transaction, the lenders and the Company have increased the combined credit facilities by an additional $15 million to a total of $380 million.
 
The Biorefinery Acquisition and Financing Transaction were completed through various subsidiaries of GCEH, each of which is currently directly or indirectly a wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiary of GCEH. Our primary subsidiary, GCE Holdings Acquisitions, LLC (“GCE Acquisitions”), owns the Bakersfield Biorefinery through certain special purpose financing subsidiaries.


Share Purchase Agreement and Call Option Agreement
 
Effective as of April 29, 2019, GCE Acquisitions entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Alon Paramount Holdings, Inc. (“Alon Paramount”) to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of Alon Bakersfield Property, Inc. (“ABPI”). ABPI was the owner of the Bakersfield refinery. We purchased the Bakersfield refinery for $40 million in cash. In addition, at closing we granted Alon Paramount an option right valued at $5.5 million, and assumed $43.9 million of liabilities. The liabilities assumed consist of $21.9 million of Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO) and $22 million of other environmental remediation liabilities. In connection with the Biorefinery Acquisition, we agreed to undertake certain cleanup activities at the refinery and provide a guaranty for liabilities arising from the cleanup. We obtained the funds used to pay the purchase price from funds we borrowed in the Financing Transaction described below.
 
Concurrently with the closing of the Biorefinery Acquisition, GCEH and GCE Acquisitions entered into a Call Option Agreement with Alon Paramount pursuant to which GCEH granted to Alon Paramount an option to purchase from GCEH up to 33 1/3% of the membership interests of GCE Acquisitions. The interest acquired upon the exercise of the option is only a financial interest in the net cash flow distributed by GCE Acquisitions after all operating expenses are paid and after all payments and distributions are made to Senior Lenders and Mezzanine Lenders. The option, if exercised, does not provide the holder with any rights to acquire or use any products produced by the Bakersfield Refinery, nor does it grant the holder any rights to manage the Bakersfield Refinery or any of our other related businesses, including our Camelina feedstock business. The option will expire on the 90th day after the refinery has commercially operated for 90 days at certain target production rates. Under the Call Option Agreement, until the expiration of the option, GCE Acquisitions has agreed to not transfer the ownership of any of its subsidiaries other than those contemplated by the Credit Agreements entered into with the Senior Lenders and the Mezzanine Lenders, or to modify or amend the certain material terms of such Credit Agreements.
 
Financing Transactions
 
In order to fund the acquisition and retooling of the Bakersfield Biorefinery, on May 4, 2020 through our newly formed special purpose subsidiaries we entered into a senior credit facility with a group of lenders (the “Senior Lenders”) and a mezzanine credit agreement with mezzanine lenders (the “Mezzanine Lenders”). The senior credit agreement provides us with a $300 million senior secured term loan facility, which amount has been increased to $313.2 million. The senior loan bears interest at the rate of 12.5% per annum, payable quarterly, is secured by all of the assets of the borrowing subsidiaries (and by the equity interests and assets of the Bakersfield Biorefinery), and matures on November 4, 2026. The mezzanine credit agreement provides us with a $65 million secured term loan facility, which has been increased to $66.8 million. The mezzanine loans bear interest at the rate of 15.0% per annum on amounts borrowed, payable quarterly, provided that we may defer interest to the extent we do not have sufficient cash to pay the interest. In addition, as additional consideration for the senior and mezzanine loans, we have agreed to grant the Senior Lenders and the Mezzanine Lenders an additional financial interest by issuing to them non-voting membership interests in our borrowing subsidiary. The mezzanine loans mature in November 2027. For additional information regarding the senior and mezzanine credit facilities, see “Item 7, Management’s Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations—Credit Agreements,” below.

Engineering, Procurement and Construction Agreements
 
GCE Acquisitions entered into an engineering, procurement and construction (“EPC”) agreement on April 30, 2020 with ARB, Inc. (“ARB”) pursuant to which ARB has agreed to provide services for the engineering, procurement, construction, start-up and testing of the Bakersfield Biorefinery, on a cost plus fee basis (subject to a guaranteed maximum price, subject to any increases for approved change orders). Effective May 7, 2020, GCE Acquisitions also entered into two other EPC agreements for the refurbishment and retooling of the facility, including the infrastructure upgrades to the rail spur and storage logistics, and the off-site work on the natural gas pipeline extension.
Haldor Topsoe A/S License
 
Effective October 24, 2018, GCE Acquisitions entered into a ten-year, non-exclusive, non-transferable license agreement with Haldor Topsoe A/S, a company established in Denmark that owns certain proprietary rights relating to processes, catalysts, and equipment designs for the hydroprocessing of natural and synthesized hydrocarbons. GCE Acquisitions licensed these rights in order to produce renewable diesel from organically derived feedstocks at the Bakersfield Biorefinery. Concurrently with entering into the license agreement, on October 24, 2018 GCE Acquisitions also entered into an engineering agreement with the U.S. affiliate of Haldor Topsoe to have the hydroprocessing unit designed and built at the Bakersfield Biorefinery, and a catalyst supply agreement for the purchase of the catalyst, with a design capacity of up to 15,000 barrels per day, to be used in the hydroprocessing unit. These agreements have been assigned to BKRF. The Haldor Topsoe license gives the Bakersfield Biorefinery the right to hydroprocess fats, oils and greases into renewable diesel, renewable propane and butane, and renewable naphtha.
Product Offtake Agreement
 
Product Off-Take Agreement. We have signed a binding Product Offtake Agreement (the “Offtake Agreement”) with ExxonMobil Oil Corporation pursuant to which ExxonMobil has committed to purchase 2.5 million barrels of renewable diesel per year (the “Committed Volume”), and we will be obligated to sell these quantities of renewable diesel to ExxonMobil. The price of the renewable diesel to be sold to ExxonMobil under the contract is based on a combination of both a fixed price and variable price. ExxonMobil’s obligation to purchase renewable diesel will last for a period of five years following the date that the Bakersfield Biorefinery commences operations. ExxonMobil has the option to extend the initial five-year term for a second five-year term. Either party may terminate the Offtake Agreement if the Bakersfield Biorefinery does not meet certain production levels by certain milestone dates following the commencement of the Bakersfield Biorefinery’s operations.

Control, Operation and Management Agreement
 
In order to operate and manage the Bakersfield Biorefinery, we formed GCE Operating Company, LLC, a new wholly-owned subsidiary of GCEH. On May 4, 2020, the Bakersfield Biorefinery entered into a Control, Operation and Maintenance Agreement (“COMA”) with GCE Operating Company, whereby GCE Operating Company will provide all necessary services required to supervise the construction of the Bakersfield Biorefinery and, after the completion of construction, to operate and maintain the Bakersfield Biorefinery. The COMA may be terminated by either party at any time for any reason. GCE Operating Company will be reimbursed for its services under the COMA.
Sustainable Oils License Agreement
 
Camelina is expected to be the primary biofuels feedstock used to produce renewable diesel at the Bakersfield Biorefinery. Sustainable Oils, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of GCEH (“SusOils”), holds our Camelina intellectual properties and operates our Camelina business that supports GCEH’s vertically integrated renewable fuels business. The shortage of feedstocks currently available for renewable fuels continues to create cost volatility that we believe can be hedged through SusOils’ purpose grown Camelina crop deployment. This shortage, combined with the worldwide pressure towards limiting the use of food-based feedstocks for the production of fuel, will continue to increase the demand for additive and ultimately replacement nonfood-based feedstocks like SusOils’ Camelina oil. GCEH’s renewable fuels business is expected to benefit from the shifting sentiment against using food-based crops for fuel and in favor of increased use of nonfood ultra-low carbon feedstocks (such as Camelina). SusOils owns multiple issued and pending patents on enhanced varieties of Camelina. SusOils has agreed to provide Camelina oil based feedstock for use at the Bakersfield Biorefinery through a ten-year license agreement with BKRF. The SusOils license grants BKRF the limited right to process, refine, produce, market and sell Camelina oil biofuels that are derived from SusOils’s patented varieties of Camelina in North America. Under the license agreement, SusOils also grants the Bakersfield Biorefinery a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, royalty-free license to use the name “Sustainable Oils” and the Sustainable Oils logo to identify its Camelina-based biofuel as a product of SusOils’s proprietary Camelina varieties. SusOils will manage all the Camelina production operations and agricultural activities needed for the deployment of Camelina as a purpose grown crop for the Bakersfield Biorefinery. Such activities include identifying and assisting farmers to grow the SusOils Camelina varieties.
 
7

 
In consideration for the rights granted under the SusOils license agreement, BKRF has agreed to pay SusOils a royalty based on the number of pounds of SusOils Camelina used at the Bakersfield Biorefinery. In the event that the Bakersfield Biorefinery does not purchase all of the Camelina produced for SusOils in any growing season, SusOils retains the right to market and sell any such excess Camelina. The license is a non-exclusive license, and SusOils will continue to have the right to produce its own crop independent of the Bakersfield Biorefinery.
 
Camelina Farming Operations
 
SusOils has been the leader in the development and regulatory approval of Camelina for over a decade. SusOils currently is a wholly-owned subsidiary of GCEH. However, SusOils has issued a non-transferable warrant to a strategic partner for the purchase of 8% of SusOils’s outstanding capital stock. The warrant expires on June 1, 2021 and is exercisable for a purchase price of $20 million.
 
In 2013, Camelina was approved as an advanced biofuel feedstock and was granted a pathway under the United States’ EPA Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program enabling it to produce D4 or D5 Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”) from biodiesel, renewable diesel, jet fuel, heating oil, naphtha and LPG. The EPA’s evaluation confirmed Camelina, and its co-products met the emissions reduction thresholds prescribed in 40 CFR § 80.1426 of the RFS. As a result of the approval, Camelina is at a competitive advantage over other oilseed crops with an RFS pathway.
 
SusOils applied for and was granted a first-of-its-kind pathway from CARB in 2016. The feedstock-only approval applies to SusOils patented Camelina varieties only and must be combined with a biorefinery pathway like BKRF’s to produce a full well-to-wheels carbon intensity. When registered as a fuels pathway, Camelina-based renewable diesel’s carbon intensity is anticipated to be at or below that of other competitors.
 
In 2020 SusOils commenced its commercial Camelina crop production and produced enough Camelina grower (certified) seed for the 2021 planned Camelina plantings. In 2020, SusOils also expanded its research acreage to approximately 1,500 acres. SusOils will control certified Camelina seed production and development, and has entered into business arrangements for the cultivation, production, storage and transportation of the Camelina feedstock. As of the date of this Annual Report, commercial production of Camelina grain and certified seed for the 2021 harvest is ongoing in Idaho, Montana, Kansas, Oregon and Colorado.
 
SusOils owns the intellectual property and related know-how for Camelina cultivation. SusOils also is directly involved in the application and funding of various research programs related to improving the growing characteristics, oil content, yields and chemistry of Camelina.

Our goal is to significantly expand Camelina certified seed and grain production in 2021, 2022 and thereafter. Under current yields and normal weather patterns, we expect that the certified seed produced from one acre of certified Camelina can plant up to 200 to 230 acres of our enhanced varieties of Camelina grain. Prior to the 2021 growing season, we paid farmers to grow our Camelina on a per-planted acre basis. Currently, we sell our certified Camelina seed to the growers/farmers and we contract with them on a time sensitive, minimum stand basis and pay them on a per pound of harvested grain basis. We expect our revenues from Camelina seed sales in 2021 to exceed $1 million and to thereafter increase based on the increased acreage under production.
 
Based on our on-going Camelina research and development efforts that both increase the yield and improve cultivation efficiencies, we expect that yields per acre will increase in the future, and that more Camelina oil will be extracted from the Camelina seed. Accordingly, although we have based our production estimates on the existing yield, we believe our Camelina yield conversion ratios will continue to improve over the next several years.

Principal Products
 
Renewable Diesel
 
The Bakersfield Biorefinery will produce renewable diesel as its primary product to be sold into the transportation sector. The design of the facility indicates that over 90% of the refined products produced at the refinery will be renewable diesel and the balance will be other renewable diesel co-products, such as renewable naphtha, renewable propane, and renewable butane.
 
Renewable diesel is made from the same feedstocks as biodiesel, but a variety of favorable qualities distinguish it as a superior fuel, causing it to carry a price premium to biodiesel. To make renewable diesel, feedstocks such as Camelina, used cooking oil, tallow, or various vegetable oils, are hydrotreated and isomerized to produce a fuel chemically identical to fossil diesel but with less contaminants. Since renewable diesel is chemically identical to fossil diesel, it can utilize the same infrastructure and can function as a drop-in, 100% replacement for fossil diesel. Renewable diesel does not need to be blended like biodiesel for use in modern engines on the road today. Also, renewable diesel does not experience the cold weather performance, water absorption, or microbial growth issues of biodiesel. Finally, because of lower levels of contaminants, renewable diesel burns cleaner than fossil diesel, reducing emissions by up to 85% as well as reducing engine maintenance issues.
 
Biofuels Oil Feedstock
 
Our goal is to use Camelina as our primary feedstock at the Bakersfield Biorefinery. The feedstock oil needed to produce renewable jet, biodiesel, renewable diesel and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) that is currently available on the market today is primarily supplied from edible seed oils, including soy, canola (rapeseed), sunflower and palm. There are other types of feedstock that can be converted into biofuels, like animal fats and recycled cooking grease. Until our Camelina production ramps up to significant levels, we will also produce renewable fuels at the Bakersfield Biorefinery from other seed oils, animal fats, recycled cooking grease and other types of feedstocks. However, our goal is to have Camelina oil produced from SusOils’ patented Camelina varieties become the primary source of our biofuels feedstock. The significant advantages of Camelina over other traditional oilseed crops are that it is ultra-low carbon and does not compete for resources with other crops grown primarily for food consumption. We expect to supply only 10% of the refinery’s feedstock requirement with Camelina oil during the first production year (2022). The amount of Camelina oil used in the biorefinery is expected to significantly increase in later years as Camelina cultivation increases. The actual amount of Camelina oil that we will supply to the Bakersfield refinery in 2022 and thereafter will depend on the number of acres of Camelina planted in 2021, 2022 and thereafter. We will start our refinery production primarily using soybean oil or other organically derived feedstocks.
 
Camelina sativa is a member of the mustard family, a distant relative to canola, and a relatively new and attractive entrant into the biofuels feedstock sector. Camelina plants are heavily branched, growing from one to three feet tall and have branched stems that become woody as they mature. As the reproductive cycle progresses, seed pods form which contain many relatively small, oily seeds. Because there is no seed dormancy in Camelina, it can be grown in multiple seasons and has a very short maturity curve.
 
Camelina can produce seeds with relatively little water and can be harvested early. It is classified as a low input crop and can survive on low water/rainfall, and less fertilizer than many other crops. Camelina can be seeded and harvested with conventional farm equipment, making it a perfect rotation crop for farmers.
 
Camelina seeds typically contain between 35-42% oil and are high in omega-3 fatty acids. This makes the oil very desirable for biofuels production. The meal left after the oil has been removed is a replacement option for livestock and poultry feed, competing directly with soy and canola meal.
 
SusOils’ patented seed varieties perform reliably across a diverse range of agronomic settings and produce reliable yields, oil content, height, chemical composition as well as protein and fiber content.

Biomass Feedstock
 
Camelina produces a co-product from the oil extraction process which is a high protein meal that has been tested and approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a livestock (animal) feed for cattle, poultry and pigs. This provides additional revenue and reduces the net production cost of Camelina oil, further improving feedstock economics.
Emissions Reduction Regulations
 
In response to anthropogenic climate change, intergovernmental organizations like the United Nations and World Bank, as well as numerous governments, supranational organizations, like the European Union, and sub-national actors, like California and British Columbia, have implemented regulations to curtail the production of greenhouse gas emissions. Regulations are beginning to span and interlace cap-and-trade policies, low carbon fuel standards, renewable portfolio standards and carbon taxes, as well as others. The overarching objective is greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions and associated climate change mitigation. With the exception of a carbon tax, GHG reduction schemes utilize tradable credits that represent the reduction of a certain amount of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) or the production of a certain volume of fuel.
 
Renewable energy and energy efficiency projects make up the bulk of mitigation and reduction strategies currently deployed around the world. Biofuels have been the cornerstone of renewable energy policies since the beginning and offer regulators, end users and consumers a unique set of attributes that include sustainability, meaningful emissions reductions and economic and energy security. Furthermore, as biofuel policies evolve, first generation feedstocks, those based on, or derived from food crops are being replaced with second generation, nonfood based crops like Camelina. Camelina is grown on fallow rotational land or in other formats that do not displace food crops. The land used is fallow or otherwise unsuitable for food crop production. The result is an avoidance of the controversial food versus fuel tradeoff currently hampering certain feedstocks development. This distinction between food and nonfood is critical as regulated markets mature and policies shift to discourage the conversion of food into fuel.


In the United States, federal legislation called the renewable fuel standard (RFS) mandates that a certain volume of biofuels are blended into the fuel supply every year. In California, the low carbon fuel standard (LCFS) requires regulated parties to reduce the overall emissions of their fuels to a predefined ceiling. In both cases, renewable fuel producers generate tradable compliance instruments, which represent either a volume of fuel or a set amount of CO2 reduction. These credits are then surrendered by regulated parties to demonstrate compliance. The RFS and LCFS require that fuels are made from approved pathways and feedstocks. Camelina has full EPA approval under the RFS to produce both D4 (biomass-based diesel) and D5 (advanced biofuel) Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) under the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS2).
 
In March 2015, California (CARB) approved a first-of-its-kind feedstock-only pathway for SusOils’ patented Camelina oil. The pathway only applies to SusOils’ US Patent and Trademark Office-registered seed varieties - no other Camelina seed or oil can be used to produce LCFS compliant fuel. At a cumulative carbon intensity (CI) of 7.58 g/MJ, our processed and renewable fuels can be produced at less than 20 CI, before any CI credits for the mean are applied. The result is that fuel producers and obligated parties in California can meet their LCFS emissions reduction requirements with significantly less fuel that would otherwise be required using traditional feedstocks like soybean (53 g/MJ). LCFS credits are generated based upon the carbon intensity of the underlying fuel, which means Camelina-based fuels will generate significantly more value per gallon than any other virgin oil-based fuel. By example, if the LCFS credit price is $200 /MT of carbon, Camelina biofuels can produce more than $1.00 more per gallon than soybean-based fuel.

Technology and Patents
 
Camelina Sativa: SusOils’ Camelina intellectual property includes U.S. patents, U.S. and Canadian patent applications, as well as other intellectual properties including trademarks, trade secrets and know-how relating to the production and cultivation of Camelina as a biofuels feedstock. SusOils currently owns three issued U.S. patents on three Camelina varieties as well as an issued U.S. patent for a method to alter and/or improve the fatty acid composition of a Camelina plant cell. SusOils recently filed seven additional patent applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. These new patent applications include six utility patent applications for new varieties of Camelina, and a provisional patent application for improved Camelina plant oil use and production. SusOil has also applied for protection under the Plant Variety Protection Act (PVPA) for its six new Camelina varieties.
Jatropha: We also have considered using Jatropha curcas as a low carbon nonfood based feedstock for renewable fuels. See, “Other Renewable Fuels - Jatropha Curcas,” below. We have not yet patented any technology relating to our Jatropha operations. However, we have developed considerable know-how, trade secrets, and proprietary processes and procedures for farm development and operations management, and we own certain intellectual property related to the genetics of the Jatropha trees that were selectively bred and propagated by GCEH in its earlier Latin American operations.
 
Our focus is to develop technologies in the following three main categories: (i) plant and soil sciences, (ii) agricultural technology and procedure development, and (iii) material processing and end use applications. Such technologies are expected to assist in reducing costs, improving efficiency, reducing carbon intensity and allowing us to improve the value creation of our products.
 
Markets
 
Renewable Diesel. Most renewable diesel in the United States is consumed in California, due to its strong LCFS program. In 2019, almost 700 million gallons (MMGal) of renewable diesel was consumed in California, compared to approximately 900 MMGal in the United States; most of the remaining renewable diesel is consumed in Oregon under its Clean Fuels Program. Domestic production accounted for roughly 533 MMGal and 500 MMGal and foreign imports accounted for 435 MMGal and 420 MMGal in 2020 and 2019, respectively, most of foreign supply originated in Singapore. Domestic production is forecasted to increase significantly during the next five years as projects representing over two billion gallons per year of capacity have been announced by various companies; however, we only expect a portion of these projects to actually come online.
 
Since renewable diesel is a 100% replacement for fossil diesel, the total potential market is represented by the sum of biodiesel, renewable diesel, and fossil diesel consumption by the transportation sector, which was almost 4,000 MMGal for California in 2019. The United States transportation sector consumed 47 billion gallons in 2019. Canada will also represent an important market as it implements its own LCFS program.
 
Agriculture: When SusOils’ Camelina grain is processed, it is separated into neat plant oil and biomass , the latter of which is a protein rich animal feed supplement similar to canola or soybean meal. An additional benefit of our animal feed is that it is non-GMO (non-genetically modified). The market for protein meal in the western United States is roughly 17 MMTPY (million tons per year), which is supplied primarily from interior states that grow and extract row crops like soybeans. The livestock industry in California’s San Joaquin Valley, which has among the largest concentrations of cattle and dairy producers in the US, imports virtually all its portion of California’s 5.7 MMTPY of protein meal from outside its borders. Domestic production of protein meal is estimated to be 125 MMTPY, which does not include imports from other parts of the world.

Environmental Impact
 
Biofuels have social, economic and environmental benefits that are a major driving force behind their adoption. Using biofuels instead of fossil fuels reduces net emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses, which are associated with global climate change and adverse regional health impacts. Biofuels are produced from renewable plant resources that “recycle” the carbon dioxide created when biofuels are consumed. Life-cycle analyses consistently show that using biofuels produced in modern facilities results in net reductions of greenhouse gas compared to using fossil fuel-based petroleum equivalents. These life-cycle analyses include the well-to-wheel energy equivalent of farming and production of biomass, including harvesting, conversion, transportation and utilization. Biofuels help nations achieve their goals of reducing carbon emissions and reducing importation of foreign oil. They burn cleanly in vehicle engines and reduce emissions of unwanted products, particularly unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and particulate matter. These characteristics contribute to improvements in local air quality and all associated health benefits.
 
We believe there is sufficient global demand for alternative, nonfood based inedible biofuel feedstocks to allow a number of companies to successfully compete worldwide. In particular, we note that we are the only U.S.-based public company producing nonfood based inedible oils for the production of biofuels, and we are the only company with full regulatory approval for its crop, which gives us a unique competitive advantage over many foreign competitors when competing in the U.S.
 
The price basis for our oil and meal products is expected to be comparable, or better, to other edible oil and biomass equivalents. To date, we have not identified any substantial effort being undertaken for the commercialization of other inedible oils that could compete with Camelina in the near term. With the growing demand for plant-based feedstocks, and the high price of oil and biofuels, we anticipate that we will be able to sell our plant oils, meal and biofuels profitably.
 
Other Renewable Fuels—Jatropha Curcas
 
In 2008, we launched our first commercial venture to produce low carbon nonfood based feedstocks for renewable fuels by developing Jatropha curcas (“Jatropha”), a non-edible plant indigenous to many tropical and subtropical regions of the world, including Mexico. During the next seven years, we acquired three farms in Mexico, comprising just under 15,000 acres, and planted over eight million Jatropha trees, consisting of over 20 varieties of Jatropha trees from around the world on the farms. In 2012 GCEH filed for an EPA Pathway for Jatropha, and in 2015 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued a pathway for Jatropha oil that allows Jatropha oil to be used as a feedstock for advanced biofuels, qualifying it to generate RINs under the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS2). Although we harvested significant quantities of Jatropha fruit and seed from our Mexico Jatropha farms, many of the Jatropha varieties were susceptible to diseases, as a result of which the harvests did not meet our long term requirements for operating a commercial Jatropha only seed energy farm. As a result, we decided to pursue the commercialization of Camelina as our primary biofuel feedstock and, in December 2015, we sold our three Mexican farms. Although we sold the Mexico farms, we retained all of the rights to Jatropha varieties that we developed as well as retaining all of our other intellectual property rights to develop biofuels from Jatropha. Although we continue to believe in Jatropha as a commercially viable feedstock for producing renewable fuels, we currently are not actively pursuing any Jatropha-related projects. However, we continue to own the Jatropha-related intellectual properties that we previously developed.
Employees.
 
As of March 31, 2021, we had 58 full time employees, of whom 50 were located at our Bakersfield Biorefinery and eight were located at our corporate office. As of March 31, 2021, we also engaged 23 full or part-time contract employees and consultants. All of the employees who are located at the Bakersfield Biorefinery are employed by GCE Operating Company, LLC, the wholly-owned subsidiary of GCEH that operates the Bakersfield Biorefinery under the COMA. We anticipate that we will have to hire additional employees at the Bakersfield Biorefinery in the future to support our operational needs. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
