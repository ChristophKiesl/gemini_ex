Item 1. Business. 
Overview
We are a global precision therapy company that is inventing transformative medicines for people with cancer and hematologic disorders. Applying an approach that is both precise and agile, we create therapies that selectively target genetic drivers, with the goal of staying one step ahead across stages of disease. Since 2011, we have leveraged our research platform, including expertise in molecular targeting and world-class drug design capabilities, to rapidly and reproducibly translate science into a broad pipeline of precision therapies. We are delivering our approved medicines, AYVAKIT™/AYVAKYT® (avapritinib) and GAVRETO™ (pralsetinib), to patients in the U.S. and Europe, and we are globally advancing multiple programs for genomically defined cancers, systemic mastocytosis, and cancer immunotherapy.
Our drug discovery approach combines our deep understanding of kinase biology with our proprietary compound library and chemistry expertise to design highly selective and potent precision therapies, with the goal of delivering significant and durable clinical benefit to patients based on the genetic driver of their disease. This uniquely targeted, scalable approach is designed to empower the rapid design and development of new treatments and increase the likelihood of success. In addition, our business model integrates our research engine with robust clinical development and commercial capabilities in oncology and hematology to create a cycle of innovation.
Systemic Mastocytosis and other Mast Cell Disorders — Avapritinib and BLU-263
Avapritinib
We are developing avapritinib for the treatment of systemic mastocytosis, or SM, a rare hematologic disorder that causes an overproduction of mast cells and the accumulation of mast cells in the bone marrow and other organs, which can lead to a wide range of debilitating symptoms and organ dysfunction and failure. Nearly all cases of SM are driven by the KIT D816V mutation, which aberrantly activates mast cells. 
In December 2020, we submitted a supplemental new drug application, or NDA, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for avapritinib for the treatment of adult patients with advanced SM. In February 2021, the FDA accepted our application and set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, action date of June 16, 2021. We also submitted a Type II variation marketing authorization application, or MAA, to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, for avapritinib for advanced SM in February 2021.
We are currently evaluating avapritinib in an ongoing registration-enabling Phase 1 clinical trial in advanced SM, which we refer to as our EXPLORER trial, and an ongoing registration-enabling Phase 2 clinical trial in advanced SM, which we refer to as our PATHFINDER trial. In September 2020, we reported positive top-line data from the EXPLORER and PATHFINDER trials. We plan to present registrational data from the PATHFINDER trial in the first half of 2021. In addition, we are evaluating avapritinib in an ongoing registration-enabling Phase 2 clinical trial in non-advanced SM, which we refer to as our PIONEER trial. In 2020, we reported data from the dose-finding portion (Part 1) of the PIONEER trial and initiated the registration-enabling Part 2 of the PIONEER trial. We expect to complete enrollment of Part 2 of the PIONEER trial in mid-2021.
The FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation to avapritinib for (i) the treatment of advanced SM, including the subtypes of aggressive SM, SM with an associated hematologic neoplasm and mast cell leukemia, and (ii) the treatment of moderate to severe indolent SM. In addition, the FDA has granted orphan drug designation to avapritinib for the treatment of mastocytosis, and the European Commission has granted orphan medicinal product designation to avapritinib for the treatment of mastocytosis.

BLU-263
BLU-263 is an investigational, orally available, potent and highly selective KIT inhibitor that we are developing for the treatment of non-advanced SM and other mast cell disorders. BLU-263 is designed to have equivalent potency as avapritinib, with low off-target activity and lower penetration of the central nervous system, or CNS, relative to avapritinib based on preclinical data, which we believe will enable development of BLU-263 in a broad population of patients with non-advanced SM, including patients with lower disease burden requiring potentially life-long chronic therapy, and potentially patients with other mast cell disorders. In January 2021, we announced positive top-line results from a Phase 1 trial of BLU-263 in healthy volunteers. Based on these data, in mid-2021, we plan to initiate a Phase 2 trial of BLU-263 in patients with non-advanced SM, which we refer to as our HARBOR trial.
RET-altered Cancers — GAVRETO™ (pralsetinib)
We are developing and commercializing pralsetinib for the treatment of RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, and for the treatment of RET-altered thyroid carcinoma, including medullary thyroid carcinoma, or MTC. We are also developing pralsetinib for the treatment of other RET-altered solid tumors. We have granted exclusive licenses to Roche and CStone Pharmaceuticals, or CStone, to develop and commercialize pralsetinib in their respective territories. See “—Collaborations and Licenses Summary” below. 
Pralsetinib is approved in the U.S. with accelerated approval under the brand name GAVRETO for the treatment of (i) adult patients with metastatic RET fusion-positive NSCLC as detected by an FDA approved test, (ii) adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with advanced or metastatic RET-mutant MTC who require systemic therapy, and (iii) adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with advanced or metastatic RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer who require systemic therapy and who are radioactive iodine-refractory (if radioactive iodine is appropriate). 
The EMA is currently reviewing our MAA for pralsetinib for RET fusion-positive NSCLC. If approved by the European Commission, Roche plans to launch pralsetinib in RET fusion-positive NSCLC in Europe in the first half of 2021. Roche also plans to submit a Type II variation MAA to the EMA for pralsetinib for RET-altered thyroid cancers in the second half of 2021, and to submit marketing applications for pralsetinib for RET-altered NSCLC and thyroid cancers across multiple additional global geographies in 2021. In addition, China’s National Medical Products Administration, or NMPA, accepted an NDA submitted by CStone in the third quarter of 2020 for pralsetinib for the treatment of RET fusion-positive NSCLC patients previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. 
We are currently evaluating pralsetinib in an ongoing registration-enabling Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with RET-altered NSCLC, MTC and other advanced solid tumors, which we refer to as our ARROW trial. Pursuant to our collaboration with Roche, we plan to co-develop pralsetinib globally in RET-altered solid tumors, including NSCLC, MTC and other thyroid cancers, as well as other solid tumors.
The FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation to pralsetinib for (i) the treatment of patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC that has progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy and (b) the treatment of patients with RET mutation-positive MTC that requires systemic treatment and for which there are no acceptable alternative treatments. In addition, the FDA has granted orphan drug designation to pralsetinib for the treatment of RET-rearranged NSCLC, JAK1/2-positive NSCLC or TRKC-positive NSCLC.
PDGFRA-Driven Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors — AYVAKIT™ / AYVAKYT® (avapritinib)
We are commercializing avapritinib for the treatment of patients with PDGFRA exon 18 mutant gastrointestinal stromal tumors, or GIST, a rare disease that is a sarcoma, or tumor of bone or connective tissue, of the gastrointestinal tract. Avapritinib is approved in the U.S. under the brand name AYVAKIT for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors harboring a PDGFRA exon 18 mutation, including PDGFRA D842V mutations, and is approved in the European Union with conditional marketing authorization under the brand name AYVAKYT as a monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST harboring a PDGFRA D842V mutation.

The European Commission has granted orphan medicinal product designation to avapritinib for the treatment of GIST. In addition, the NMPA accepted an NDA submitted by CStone in the first quarter of 2020 for avapritinib for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic PDGFRA exon 18 mutant GIST. CStone also submitted an NDA to the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration, or the TFDA, for avapritinib for the indication of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST harboring a PDGFRA exon 18 mutation, including PDGFRA D842V mutations, and received priority review designation from the TFDA. 
Treatment-Resistant EGFR-Mutated NSCLC 
We are developing two investigational EGFR inhibitors, BLU-701 and BLU-945, with the goal of addressing the most common on-target resistance mutations to currently available EGFR-targeted therapies. While the introduction of EGFR-targeted therapies, including osimertinib, has transformed the care of patients with EGFR-driven NSCLC, treatment resistance is a significant emerging unmet medical need. 
In addition to targeting EGFR resistance mutations, BLU-701 and BLU-945 were specifically designed for selectivity over wild-type EGFR and other kinases to enable potential improved tolerability and also combination strategies. In addition, in preclinical tumor models, both drug candidates have shown CNS activity, highlighting the potential to address CNS metastases which are more common in treatment-experienced NSCLC patients.
We plan to initially develop BLU-701 and BLU-945 as monotherapies and in combination with each other and other therapies to overcome treatment resistance in specific patient populations with EGFR-driven NSCLC. 
EGFR-Positive Double Mutant NSCLC — BLU-701 
BLU-701 is a selective and potent investigational inhibitor of double-mutant EGFR harboring either the activating L858R or exon 19 deletion mutations combined with the acquired C797S mutation, the most common on-target resistance mutation to osimertinib. We plan to initially develop BLU-701 as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies. We plan to present foundational preclinical data for BLU-701 in the first half of 2021, and we plan to initiate a Phase 1 trial of BLU-701 in the second half of 2021.
EGFR-Positive Triple Mutant NSCLC — BLU-945
BLU-945 is a selective and potent investigational inhibitor of triple-mutant EGFR harboring either the activating L858R or exon 19 deletion mutations combined with the acquired T790M and C797S mutations, the most common on-target resistance to first-generation EGFR inhibitors and osimertinib, respectively. 
In preclinical data presented in September 2020, BLU-945 inhibited triple mutant EGFR with sub-nanomolar potency and demonstrated greater than 900-fold selectivity over wild-type EGFR along with excellent overall kinome selectivity. In a triple mutant EGFR cell-line, BLU-945 potently inhibited the EGFR pathway, while osimertinib demonstrated limited activity. BLU-945 monotherapy resulted in robust anti-tumor activity in multiple cell line-derived and patient-derived xenograft models of triple mutant EGFR NSCLC. In addition, BLU-945 treatment in combination with osimertinib or gefitinib resulted in tumor regression in a triple mutant EGFR NSCLC patient-derived xenograft model, which was derived from a patient with progressive disease following five lines of prior therapy. BLU-945 was also highly active in an intracranial disease model.
Based on these preclinical proof-of-concept data, we plan to initially develop BLU-945 as a monotherapy and in combination with other agents. We plan to initiate a Phase 1 trial of BLU-945 in patients with EGFR-driven NSCLC, in the first half of 2021. 
Fisogatinib — Hepatocellular Carcinoma
We are developing fisogatinib for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC. Fisogatinib is an investigational, orally available, potent and highly selective inhibitor that targets FGFR4, a kinase that is aberrantly activated in a defined subset of patients with HCC, the most common type of liver cancer. As part of our collaboration with CStone, we are evaluating fisogatinib as a monotherapy and in combination with sugemalimab, a clinical-stage anti-PDL1 immunotherapy being developed by CStone, for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic HCC in an 

7




ongoing Phase 1b/2 trial conducted in multiple clinical sites in China. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to fisogatinib for the treatment of HCC.
Discovery Platform 
We plan to continue to leverage our discovery platform to systematically and reproducibly identify kinases that are drivers of diseases in genomically defined patient populations and craft drug candidates that potently and selectively target these kinases. 
In addition to our discovery programs for treatment-resistant EGFR-mutated NSCLC, we currently have the following wholly-owned discovery programs:


● | CDK2 Discovery Program. In February 2021, we announced a discovery program targeting CDK2. CDK2, a cyclin-dependent kinase involved in cell cycle biology, is activated by its regulatory partner Cyclin E, and can drive cancer cell proliferation when Cyclin E is aberrantly expressed. Dysregulated Cyclin E is associated with multiple malignancies and has been shown to be a mechanism of resistance to targeted therapies, including CDK4/6 inhibitors.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Other Discovery Programs. In addition to the discovery programs described above, we have two wholly-owned pre-development candidate programs for undisclosed kinase targets.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under our immunotherapy collaboration with Roche, we are conducting activities for up to two discovery programs, including a development candidate for the kinase target MAP4K1. See “—Collaborations and Licenses Summary” below. We plan to present initial preclinical data for our MAP4K1 development candidate in the first half of 2021.
Collaborations and Licenses Summary
Roche—Immunotherapy Collaboration. In March 2016, we entered into a collaboration with Roche to discover, develop and commercialize up to two small molecule therapeutics targeting kinases believed to be important in cancer immunotherapy (including the kinase target MAP4K1, which is believed to play a role in T cell regulation), as single products or possibly in combination with other therapeutics.
Roche—Pralsetinib Collaboration. In July 2020, we entered into a collaboration with Roche to develop and commercialize pralsetinib for the treatment of RET-altered cancers. Under the collaboration, we and Genentech are co-commercializing GAVRETO in the U.S., and Roche has exclusive commercialization rights for pralsetinib outside of the U.S., excluding the CStone territory. We and Roche also plan to co-develop pralsetinib globally in RET-altered solid tumors, including NSCLC, MTC and other thyroid cancers, and expand development of pralsetinib in multiple treatment settings. Further, we and Roche plan to explore development of a next-generation RET inhibitor as part of the collaboration.
CStone. In June 2018, we entered into a collaboration with CStone to develop and commercialize avapritinib, pralsetinib and fisogatinib, including back-up forms and certain other forms, in the CStone territory either as a monotherapy or as part of a combination therapy. 
Clementia. In October 2019, we entered into a license agreement with Clementia Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Clementia, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ipsen S.A., and granted Clementia an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to develop and commercialize BLU-782, as well as specified other compounds related to the BLU-782 program. BLU-782 is an investigational, orally available, potent and highly selective inhibitor that targets mutant activin-like kinase 2, or ALK2, in development for the treatment of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, or FOP. The FDA has granted a rare pediatric disease designation, orphan drug designation and fast track designation to BLU-782, each for the treatment of FOP.
We will continue to evaluate additional collaborations, partnerships and licenses that could maximize the value for our programs and allow us to leverage the expertise of strategic collaborators, partners and licensors, including in additional geographies where we may not have current operations or expertise. We are also focused on engaging in collaborations, partnerships and license agreements to capitalize on our discovery platform outside of our primary strategic focus area of cancer and rare diseases.

Our Strategy
As a fully-integrated, global precision therapy company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing a portfolio of precision therapies, our vision is to bring life-changing precision therapies to as many patients with cancer and hematologic disorders as possible. To achieve this goal, key elements of our strategy are as follows:
●Accelerate the global adoption of our approved medicines, AYVAKIT and GAVRETO in the U.S. and AYVAKYT in Europe, by continuing to strengthen and expand our global commercial capabilities and preparing for additional planned commercial launches in additional indications, including advanced and non-advanced SM.
●Deepen our strategic focus on SM and related mast cell disorders by seeking regulatory approvals for avapritinib for the treatment of advanced and non-advanced SM and developing BLU-263 for the treatment of non-advanced SM, as well as exploring opportunities to address the needs of additional patient populations with adjacent hematologic disorders.
●Advance the global development and commercialization of pralsetinib and to seek international regulatory approvals under the Roche pralsetinib collaboration as a treatment for RET-altered cancers.
●Advance our innovative research programs, including BLU-701 and BLU-945, our selective and potent EGFR inhibitors for treatment-resistant EGFR-driven NSCLC, and our other preclinical programs, rapidly through development with plans to seek regulatory approval.
●Expand our broad, differentiated precision medicine pipeline, with a focus on genomically defined cancers and hematologic disorders and continued internal discovery research and innovation, as well as opportunities to acquire or in-license complementary technologies or therapies.
●Evaluate potential additional collaborations, partnerships and licenses that could maximize the value of our existing programs and allow us to leverage the expertise of strategic collaborators, partners and licensors, including in additional geographies where we may not have current operations or expertise.
●Maintain a commitment to building a corporate culture centered by our focus on patient needs, science-driven approach to drug development, and organizational strength through the diversity of experience and perspective across our workforce.

Our Precision Therapy Approach
Our approach is to systematically and reproducibly identify drivers of disease in genomically defined patient populations and to craft drug candidates that provide significant and durable clinical responses to patients. This approach enables us to drug known targets that have been difficult to inhibit selectively and also identify, characterize and design drug candidates to inhibit novel targets. By focusing on diseases in genomically defined patient populations, we believe that we can quickly identify the patients most likely to respond, resulting in a more efficient development path with a greater likelihood of success. To date, our approach has been enabled by our drug discovery platform consisting of two pillars: (1) a proprietary, highly-annotated library of novel compounds; and (2) a novel target discovery engine, which is a comprehensive process that interrogates kinase biology from many angles using genomics, structural biology and cell biology. 

10




We have initially focused our efforts on kinase drug discovery and development. Kinases are enzymes that function in many signaling pathways to regulate critical cellular functions. Kinase-dependent signaling networks are present in multiple different cell types and deregulation of these networks can lead to disease pathology. Abnormal activation of kinases has been shown to drive several key activities of cancer cells, including growth, survival, metabolism, cell motility and angiogenesis. Kinases may become abnormally activated through a number of mechanisms, including when: (1) a gene mutates creating a change in the resulting protein sequence; (2) chromosomes become rearranged creating a translocation or a fusion gene; or (3) excessive amounts of protein are created due to gene duplication or dysregulation leading to overexpression. There is a strong link between genomic alterations in kinases and disease, including specific forms of cancer and rare diseases. Several kinases have been validated as oncogenes, which are genes that when altered can initiate and maintain cancer growth. Ongoing genomic analyses of tumor data sets continue to identify new roles for kinases as drivers of disease.
We believe there is substantial opportunity for developing novel and transformative therapies that target well-characterized but currently difficult-to-drug kinases as well as kinases of unknown biology which constitute the majority of the kinome, by:
●Crafting very selective kinase drugs. Due to the high degree of homology between kinases, specific targeting of a given kinase can be challenging. Many of the approved kinase drugs inhibit multiple kinases and are referred to as multi-kinase inhibitors. Due to inhibition of off-target kinases, these multi-kinase inhibitors often give rise to severe unwanted effects, which can negatively impact the ability to dose patients at sufficient levels to achieve optimal efficacy. We believe increasing selectivity will minimize off-target toxicities and will improve efficacy by enabling higher dose levels and greater target inhibition. Further, combination therapies require that the drugs have non-overlapping toxicities, which could be minimized with more selective agents.
●Generating novel chemical matter required to target difficult-to-drug kinases. Novel chemical matter is needed to address targets that are known but have proven difficult-to-drug. Pharmaceutical companies generally rely on known chemical families as the basis of drug discovery programs. Consequently, the vast majority of pharmaceutical companies have similar compound libraries. New approaches are needed to develop novel chemistry and differentiated libraries that can inhibit difficult-to-drug kinases in alternate ways.
●Overcoming resistance mediated by the alteration of kinase targets. Most approved kinase inhibitors provide only temporary disease control. Patients may relapse due to the emergence of on-target resistance mutations. Novel approaches are needed to predict and inhibit resistant mutants thus providing more durable clinical responses.

Disease Overviews
Systemic Mastocytosis (SM)
SM is a disorder of the mast cells, the key effector cells of allergic inflammation, which have several physiologic roles including wound healing, regulation of vascular and epithelial permeability and immune cell recruitment. The signature of SM is the overproduction of mast cells and the accumulation of mast cells in the bone marrow and other organs. In advanced forms of SM, abnormal mast cells may also accumulate in the liver, spleen, gastrointestinal tract and bones. Mast cell activation and histamine release can lead to severe allergic symptoms ranging from a skin rash to hives, fever and anaphylaxis, while mast cell accumulation in advanced cases of SM can eventually lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
SM comprises a spectrum of disease, with nearly all patients (approximately 95%) having a KIT D816V mutation, the underlying driver of disease for most SM patients. The diagnosis, which is usually made in adulthood, involves a complex diagnostic algorithm that begins with confirmation of SM and subsequently categorizes patients into non-advanced or advanced subtypes of disease. Indolent SM, a subset of non-advanced SM, is the most common form of SM and is characterized by often severe, unpredictable and debilitating symptoms due to mast cell activation. Symptoms may include hypersensitivity reactions, including unpredictable anaphylaxis, gastrointestinal distress including severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, and extensive skin rashes that cause pain, discomfort and social isolation. Advanced SM 

11




is a more rare form of SM associated with mast cell infiltration of organ systems resulting in increasingly severe impact on life expectancy, and includes three subsets: aggressive SM, or ASM, advanced SM with an associated hematologic neoplasm, SM-AHN, and mast cell leukemia, or MCL. These advanced forms of SM have a median overall survival of three to five years and are characterized by prominent organopathy and dysfunction, as well as symptoms of mast cell activation.
Advanced SM accounts for approximately 5% of the patients, and non-advanced SM, including indolent SM and an intermediate form referred to as smoldering SM, account for the remaining 95% of patients. Population studies estimate the prevalence rate of all subtypes of SM is approximately 9.6 per 100,000 people. We estimate that in the U.S., France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and Japan, which we collectively refer to as the Major Markets, there are approximately 75,000 patients with SM, including 3,750 patients with advanced SM and 71,250 patients with non-advanced SM. 
The current treatment paradigm for SM varies by disease subtype. Currently, there are no approved targeted therapies that address the approximately 95% of SM patients with the KIT D816V mutation. There are two approved therapies for advanced SM: midostaurin and imatinib. Midostaurin is a multi-kinase inhibitor with limited KIT D816V inhibitory activity. Imatinib is approved only for patients who do not harbor the KIT D816V mutation.
For patients with non-advanced SM, management is symptom-directed and includes avoidance of triggers of mast cell activation (such as insect stings). Treatments for non-advanced SM include histamine blockers, cromolyn, epinephrine, corticosteroids, and, in cases of refractory patients, cytoreductive agents. Patients often take multiple symptom-directed treatments to manage their disease, and a reduction in polypharmacy burden is an important treatment goal. Within non-advanced SM, key opinion leaders see the greatest degree of unmet need for a significant portion of patients who have a heavy symptom burden that current therapies fail to address.
For patients with advanced SM, treatments include midostaurin, interferon-alpha or cytoreductive agents to reduce mast cell burden or treatments aimed at addressing the associated blood disorder. Historical data have shown overall survival of approximately three to five years in patients with advanced SM.
We are developing avapritinib for the treatment of systemic mastocytosis and BLU-263 for the treatment of non-advanced SM and other mast cell disorders. Previously reported clinical data of avapritinib for patients with SM are described below. In January 2021, we announced positive top-line results of BLU-263 in a Phase 1 healthy volunteer trial. Based on the top-line results, we plan to initiate a Phase 2 trial of BLU-263 in patients with non-advanced SM in mid-2021.
Clinical Trial Data in SM
Avapritinib—Phase 1 EXPLORER Trial and Phase 2 PATHFINDER Trial
We are evaluating avapritinib for the treatment of patients with advanced SM in our registration-enabling EXPLORER and PATHFINDER clinical trials. The EXPLORER trial is an open-label, single-arm Phase 1 trial. The PATHFINDER trial is an open-label, single-arm Phase 2 trial. Both trials have completed enrollment. For both the EXPLORER and PATHFINDER trials, key endpoints include overall response rate, or ORR, duration of response, or DOR, quantitative measures of mast cell burden, patient-reported outcomes and safety. 
Top-line Data Announced in September 2020
Across both trials, 85 patients were evaluable for response per the modified IWG-MRT-ECNM criteria, or IWG criteria, including 44 patients treated with a starting dose of 200 mg once daily, or QD. Top-line results were reported as of a data cutoff date of May 27, 2020 in the EXPLORER trial and a data cutoff date of June 23, 2020 in the PATHFINDER trial, with response assessments per central review completed in September 2020. Registrational endpoints are ORR and DOR based on central review. ORR was defined as complete remission with full or partial 

12




recovery of peripheral blood counts, or CR/CRh, partial remission or clinical improvement. The confidence interval, or CI, represents the confidence interval of the reported endpoints. All reported clinical responses were confirmed.
Clinical Activity Data. In the EXPLORER trial, 53 patients were response evaluable, with a median follow-up of 27.3 months. In EXPLORER, the ORR was 76 percent (95% CI: 62%, 86%), and 36 percent of patients had a CR/CRh. The median DOR was 38.3 months (95% CI: 21.7 months, not estimable). The median overall survival, or OS, was not estimable (95% CI: 46.9 months, not estimable).
In a pre-specified interim analysis from the PATHFINDER trial, 32 patients were response evaluable, with a median follow-up of 10.4 months. The ORR was 75 percent (95% CI: 57%, 89%), and 19 percent of patients had a CR/CRh. In addition, the data showed that responses are continuing to deepen over time, at a rate consistent with the EXPLORER trial. The median DOR was not estimable (95% CI: not estimable, not estimable), and OS was not assessed due to the length of time patients have been enrolled in PATHFINDER. The top-line PATHFINDER results were based on a pre-planned analysis designed to assess the superiority of avapritinib versus the ORR per IWG criteria previously reported for the multi-kinase inhibitor midostaurin. The interim analysis achieved its primary endpoint with a p-value of p=0.0000000016.
In a pooled efficacy analysis from the 200 mg QD dose group, 44 patients were response evaluable, with a median follow-up of 10.4 months. In this group, the ORR was 68 percent, and 18 percent of patients had a CR/CRh.
Safety Data. Avapritinib was generally well-tolerated with most adverse events, or AEs, reported as Grade 1 or 2. In the EXPLORER and PATHFINDER trials, avapritinib demonstrated improved tolerability at a starting dose of 200 mg QD, compared to all doses. Across both trials, 8.1 percent of patients discontinued avapritinib due to treatment-related AEs.
Previously reported results from the EXPLORER trial showed that pre-existing severe thrombocytopenia, which occurs in approximately 10 to 15 percent of advanced SM patients based on our estimates, and starting doses of 300 mg QD or higher were contributing risk factors for intracranial bleeding, or ICB. Based on these data, we implemented treatment management guidelines in the EXPLORER and PATHFINDER trials, including exclusion criteria for pre-existing severe thrombocytopenia, routine platelet monitoring and dose interruption guidelines for emergent severe thrombocytopenia. In 76 EXPLORER and PATHFINDER trial patients without pre-existing severe thrombocytopenia treated at the 200 mg QD dose, two patients (2.6 percent) had ICB events. Both AEs were Grade 1 and asymptomatic. These safety data validate the clinical impact of the treatment management guidelines.
Phase 2 PIONEER Trial 
PIONEER is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, registration-enabling trial evaluating avapritinib in patients with indolent and smoldering SM. The trial includes three parts: dose-finding Part 1, registration-enabling Part 2 and long-term treatment Part 3. All patients who complete Parts 1 or 2 will have an opportunity to continue to receive treatment with avapritinib in Part 3. Key trial endpoints include the change in patient-reported disease symptoms as measured by the Indolent SM Symptom Assessment Form Total Symptom Score, or ISM-SAF TSS, quantitative measures of mast cell burden and safety. Part 1 has completed patient enrollment. We expect to complete enrollment of Part 2 of the PIONEER trial in mid-2021.
Data Presented at American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology Virtual Forum in March 2020
Part 1 of the PIONEER trial was designed to determine the recommended phase 2 dose, or RP2D, by evaluating three doses of avapritinib (25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg QD) versus placebo. Key eligibility criteria include adults with indolent SM confirmed by central pathology review and moderate-to-severe symptom burden despite best supportive care medicines. Overall, 39 patients were enrolled in Part 1 across four concurrent cohorts, consisting of 10 patients each in the avapritinib dose cohorts and nine patients in the placebo cohort. Patient-reported outcomes, or PRO, data were collected using the ISM-SAF, which was designed with input from disease experts, patients and regulatory authorities to support registration. All results were as of a data cutoff date of December 27, 2019.

Baseline Patient Characteristics. Patients had high symptom burden at baseline, with a mean ISM-SAF TSS of 53 on a scale of 0 to 110. Eight patients (21 percent) had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of 2, reflecting the inability to carry out any work activities. Patients received a median of four best supportive care medicines at baseline (range: 2-9). Median serum tryptase was 45 micrograms per liter (the upper limit of normal is 11.4 micrograms per liter). A high sensitivity polymerase chain reaction assay on peripheral blood detected the KIT D816V mutation in 37 patients (95 percent).
Clinical Activity Data. Avapritinib showed broad activity across measures of mast cell burden, the patient reports outcomes, or PRO, clinical benefit measure and quality of life. The consistency of results observed across multiple measures of disease burden support the further evaluation of avapritinib in indolent SM. At 16 weeks, patients had a statistically significant reduction in ISM-SAF TSS, with a mean improvement of approximately 30 percent across all avapritinib dose cohorts compared to approximately 3 percent in the placebo cohort (p=0.001). As of the data cutoff date, 37 patients (95 percent) have remained on study with a median follow-up of 18 weeks.
Results from the 25 mg QD dose cohort show important clinical activity, including meaningful declines in serum tryptase, bone marrow mast cells and KIT D816V allele burden. Treatment with avapritinib led to consistent reductions in the ISM-SAF TSS, gastrointestinal domain, skin domain and each individual symptom. Symptom improvements in patients treated at 25 mg QD continued to deepen over time.

Mean Percent Changes in ISM-SAF at 16 Weeks (negative change = improved symptoms)
​ | Avapritinib25 mg QD | Placebo
TSS | -31% | -3% 
Skin domain | -37% | +3% 
Gastrointestinal domain | -25% | +6% 
Neurological symptoms | -26% | -8% 

Data from the Mastocytosis Quality of Life, or MC-QoL, questionnaire, a PRO tool developed for mast cell disorders, show improvements in quality of life for patients receiving avapritinib and support the results observed with the ISM-SAF. Patients in the 25 mg QD dose cohort had a mean reduction of 34 percent in the total MC-QoL score and improvements in all four domains assessed (symptoms, social life functioning, emotions and skin). A 7 percent increase from baseline was observed in the placebo cohort.
Safety Data. The safety profile of avapritinib supports chronic dosing in indolent SM. All doses of avapritinib were well-tolerated and no patients discontinued treatment due to AEs. No patients treated with avapritinib in the 25 mg QD dose cohort had serious AEs, Grade 3 or higher AEs, or dose modifications. In the placebo cohort, two patients (22 percent) had Grade 3 AEs, one with seizure and one with diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis; these events also met criteria for serious AEs.
Data Presented at European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Digital Congress in June 2020
Previously reported data from Part 1 of the PIONEER trial showed that treatment with avapritinib was well-tolerated and resulted in robust and clinically meaningful improvements on measures of mast cell burden, disease symptoms and patient-reported quality of life through 16 weeks. Based on these data, avapritinib 25 mg QD was selected as the RP2D. Updated data on disease symptoms through 24 weeks and new skin assessment results were reported in June 2020.
Clinical Activity Data. As of a data cutoff date of March 31, 2020, updated data from Part 1 of the PIONEER trial showed a deepening of symptom reductions in patients treated with avapritinib through 24 weeks of follow-up. The mean percent change from baseline in ISM-SAF TSS was -35 percent in patients treated with avapritinib 25 mg QD (n=10) compared to -4 percent in patients treated with placebo. In addition, the mean percent change from baseline in ISM-SAF skin domain score was -38 percent for avapritinib 25 mg QD versus +11 percent for placebo.

The updated data also showed a 60 percent response rate in patients treated with avapritinib 25 mg QD compared to a zero percent response rate in patients treated with placebo at 24 weeks, with response defined as a 30 percent or greater reduction in ISM-SAF TSS. 
High resolution skin photographs were taken at baseline and every 12 weeks during treatment for patients with significant cutaneous involvement who consented to photography. To assess changes in skin disease, photographs were assessed by a blinded independent review committee and a computational image analysis algorithm. Images and data as of a cutoff of March 31, 2020 were evaluated by the independent committee.
Based on skin photography at 24 weeks or the last available assessment, results showed that skin lesions lightened in 71 percent of patients treated with avapritinib (n=17; all doses) compared to 25 percent of patients treated with placebo (n=8), per blinded review by the independent committee. In addition, the median percent change from baseline in most affected surface area was -35 percent for avapritinib (n=18; all doses) compared to -8 percent for placebo (n=8), based on a computational image analysis algorithm.
Mast cell infiltration in skin lesions was also assessed by lesional skin biopsies obtained at baseline and 12 weeks. The median percent change from baseline in mast cell infiltration was -46 percent for avapritinib (n=18; all doses) compared to +51 percent for placebo (n=7).
Safety Data. As of a data cutoff date of March 31, 2020, avapritinib 25 mg QD was well-tolerated and safety results were consistent with previously reported data, with no Grade ≥3 adverse events or discontinuations due to adverse events.
RET-Altered Cancers 
RET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that activates multiple downstream pathways involved in cell proliferation and survival. RET can be activated by mutation or when a portion of the RET gene that encodes the kinase domain is joined to part of another gene creating a fusion gene that encodes an aberrantly activated RET fusion protein. RET activating mutations are implicated in advanced MTC (approximately 90% of patients), and RET fusions are implicated in several cancers, including papillary thyroid carcinoma (approximately 10- 20% of patients) and NSCLC (1-2% of patients). We estimate that in the Major Markets, there are approximately 8,900 first-and second-line patients with RET-altered NSCLC and 1,300 patients with MTC, regardless of line of therapy or alteration. In addition, oncogenic RET alterations are observed at low frequencies in colorectal, breast, pancreatic and other cancers, providing a therapeutic rationale for the use of RET inhibitors in multiple patient subpopulations.
The identification of RET fusions as drivers in some cancers prompted the use of approved multi-kinase inhibitors with RET inhibitory activity to treat patients whose tumors express a RET fusion protein. However, we believe these drugs cannot be dosed at levels required to sufficiently inhibit RET due to toxicities that result from inhibition of the primary targets. For example, currently approved therapies such as vandetanib and cabozantinib demonstrate lower objective response rates and DOR in patients with RET-altered NSCLC compared to selective kinase inhibitors targeting other kinase drivers such as EGFR, ALK and ROS1.
One of the greatest challenges in treating cancer is the ability of tumor cells to become resistant to therapy. Kinase reactivation via mutation to evade small molecule inhibition is a common mechanism of resistance. We have predicted future resistance mutations of drugs with RET inhibitory activity. Thus, there is a clear need for a selective RET inhibitor that targets both oncogenic RET fusions and activating mutations and their predicted RET resistance mutations. 
Currently, pralsetinib (under the brand name GAVRETO) is the only once-daily RET-targeted therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of certain RET-altered NSCLC and thyroid cancers in the U.S. Previously reported clinical data of pralsetinib in patients with RET-altered cancers are described below. Pursuant to our collaboration with Roche, we plan to co-develop pralsetinib globally in RET-altered solid tumors, including NSCLC, MTC and other thyroid cancers, as well as other solid tumors.

Clinical Trial Data in RET-altered NSCLC and Thyroid Cancers
GAVRETO (pralsetinib)—Phase 1/2 ARROW Trial 
The ARROW trial is a Phase 1/2 open-label, registration-enabling trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of pralsetinib in adults with RET-altered cancers. The trial consists of two parts: a dose escalation portion and an expansion portion in patients treated at 400 mg QD. The dose-escalation portion of the ARROW trial is complete, and the expansion portion is actively enrolling patients at multiple sites in the United States, European Union and Asia.
Top-Line Data in RET-Altered Thyroid Cancers Announced in April 2020
Top-line efficacy data were reported for patients treated with pralsetinib who were evaluable for response assessment per RECIST 1.1, as determined by blinded independent central review. All patients received the proposed indicated dose of 400 mg QD. All results were as of a data cutoff date of February 13, 2020. 
Clinical Activity Data. In 53 patients with RET-mutant MTC previously treated with cabozantinib or vandetanib, the ORR was 60 percent (95% CI: 46%,74%) with one response pending confirmation. Nearly all patients (98 percent) had tumor shrinkage. The median DOR was not reached (95% CI: not estimable, not estimable), and the 18-month DOR rate was 90 percent (95% CI: 77%, 100%).
In addition, the top-line data showed robust clinical activity in treatment-naïve patients, supporting the potential of pralsetinib across lines of therapy. In 19 patients with RET-mutant MTC who had not received prior systemic treatment, the confirmed ORR was 74 percent (95% CI: 49%, 91%), and all patients had tumor shrinkage. The median DOR was not reached (95% CI: 7 months, not estimable), with 12 of 14 responders remaining in response for up to 15 months as of the data cutoff date.
In nine patients with RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer, the confirmed ORR was 89 percent (95% CI: 52%, 100%), and all patients had tumor shrinkage. The median DOR was not reached (95% CI: 8 months, not estimable), with seven of eight responders remaining in response for up to 20 months as of the data cutoff date.
Safety Data. Top-line safety data were consistent with those previously reported. Pralsetinib was well-tolerated, and most treatment-related AEs were Grade 1 or 2. Across all patients enrolled in the ARROW trial treated at the proposed indicated dose of 400 mg QD (n=438), only 4 percent discontinued treatment with pralsetinib due to treatment-related AEs.
Data Presented at American Society of Clinical Oncology 2020 Virtual Scientific Program in May 2020
The reported data included response-evaluable populations comprising 116 patients with NSCLC who received a starting dose of 400 mg QD, including 80 patients with NSCLC previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and 26 patients with treatment-naïve NSCLC, 11 patients with RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer, and 12 patients with other RET fusion-positive cancers. Tumor response was assessed by blinded, independent central review using RECIST version 1.1. 
Clinical Activity Data – RET Fusion-Positive NSCLC. As of a data cutoff of November 18, 2019, pralsetinib demonstrated consistent and robust clinical activity in RET fusion-positive NSCLC, regardless of prior therapy, RET fusion partner or CNS involvement.
In 80 patients who previously received platinum-based chemotherapy, the ORR was 61 percent (95% CI: 50%, 72%). Two partial responses, or PRs, were pending confirmation at the time of the data cut off and were subsequently confirmed. Five percent of patients had a complete response, or CR, and 14 percent of patients had complete regression 

16




of target tumors. In 26 patients with no prior systemic therapy, the confirmed ORR was 73 percent (95% CI: 52%, 88%), and the CR rate was 12 percent.
Across all 116 patients, regardless of prior therapy, the median DOR was not reached (95% CI: 11 months, not reached), and the 6-month DOR was 86 percent. Overall, 74 percent of confirmed responders, including all patients with CRs, were on treatment as of the data cutoff.
Robust and durable intracranial activity was shown in nine patients with measurable CNS metastases at baseline. All patients had shrinkage of CNS metastases, with an intracranial CR rate of 33 percent. No CNS responders experienced CNS progressive events. The median CNS DOR was not reached, with ongoing treatment durations up to 12 months in patients with measurable CNS metastases. Among patients without a history of CNS metastases, none have developed new CNS metastases on study as of the data cutoff date.
Clinical Activity Data – Other RET Fusion-Positive Cancers. As of a data cutoff of February 13, 2020, pralsetinib demonstrated robust clinical activity in a range of additional RET fusion-positive cancers. In 11 patients with RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer (10 previously treated with systemic therapy), the centrally confirmed ORR was 91 percent (95% CI: 59%, 100%), and the disease control rate, or DCR, was 100 percent (95% CI: 72%, 100%). Overall, 70 percent of responders remain on therapy with ongoing treatment durations up to 22 months as of the data cutoff. Across 12 patients with other RET fusion-positive cancers previously treated with systemic therapy, the investigator-assessed ORR was 50 percent (95% CI: 21%, 79%), with one PR pending confirmation as of the data cutoff. Responses were observed in all evaluable patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n=3) and cholangiocarcinoma (n=2), tumor types with a typically poor prognosis.
Safety Data. As of the data cutoff date of November 18, 2019, a total of 354 patients were enrolled in the ARROW trial at a starting dose of 400 mg QD. Overall, safety results were consistent with previously reported data. Pralsetinib was well-tolerated across tumor types, and most treatment-related AEs were Grade 1 or 2.
The most common treatment-related AEs reported by investigators (≥15 percent) were increased aspartate aminotransferase, anemia, increased alanine aminotransferase, constipation, hypertension and neutropenia. Investigator-reported Grade 3 or higher treatment-related AEs (≥5 percent) were hypertension, neutropenia and anemia. Only 4 percent of patients discontinued pralsetinib due to treatment-related AEs.
Data Presented at European Society for Medical Oncology Virtual Congress 2020 in September 2020
The presented data included response-evaluable patients with RET-mutant MTC who were previously treated with cabozantinib or vandetanib, or naïve to systemic treatment. Tumor response was assessed by blinded, independent central review using RECIST version 1.1. All patients received a pralsetinib starting dose of 400 mg QD, and results were reported as of a data cutoff date of February 13, 2020. 
Clinical Activity Data – RET-Mutant MTC. Pralsetinib demonstrated broad clinical activity in patients with RET-mutant MTC with or without prior systemic therapy. In 53 patients previously treated with cabozantinib or vandetanib, the ORR was 60 percent (95% CI: 46%, 74%) with one response pending confirmation, and the DCR was 96 percent (95% CI: 87%, 100%). The median DOR was not reached (95% CI: not reached, not reached), with 94 percent of responders remaining on treatment. The median progression-free survival, or PFS, was not reached (95% CI: not reached, not reached) in patients previously treated with cabozantinib or vandetanib.
In 19 systemic treatment-naïve patients who were ineligible for standard therapy per the study protocol, the confirmed ORR was 74 percent (95% CI: 49%, 91%), and the DCR was 100 percent (95% CI: 82%, 100%). The median DOR was not reached (95% CI: 7 months, not reached), with 93 percent of responders remaining on treatment. The median PFS was not reached (95% CI: not reached, not reached) in systemic treatment-naïve patients.
Five of six patients whose tumors had a RET V804M or V804L gatekeeper mutation achieved a clinical response. Three patients previously treated with multi-kinase inhibitors had a RET M918T activating mutation and a 

17




RET V804M or V804L gatekeeper resistance mutation at baseline, and all three of these patients had a clinical response following pralsetinib treatment.
Safety Data. The reported safety data included a total of 438 patients enrolled in the ARROW trial at a pralsetinib starting dose of 400 mg QD, regardless of tumor type. Pralsetinib was well-tolerated with safety results consistent with previously reported data. Overall, treatment-related AEs were primarily Grade 1 or 2. The most common treatment-related AEs reported by investigators (≥15 percent) were increased aspartate aminotransferase, anemia, increased alanine aminotransferase, hypertension, constipation, decreased white blood cell count, neutropenia, decreased neutrophil count and hyperphosphatemia. Investigator-reported Grade 3 or higher treatment-related AEs (≥5 percent) were hypertension, neutropenia, anemia and decreased neutrophil count. Four percent of patients discontinued pralsetinib due to treatment-related AEs.
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST)
GIST is a rare disease that is a sarcoma of the gastrointestinal tract. Tumors arise within cells in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract and occur most often in the stomach or small intestine. Most patients are diagnosed between the ages of 50-80 with diagnosis triggered by gastrointestinal bleeding, incidental findings during surgery or imaging, or in rare cases acute presentation due to tumor rupture or gastrointestinal obstruction. The standard workup at primary presentation includes pathologic confirmation and imaging to assess extent of disease.
The GIST treatment paradigm has advanced dramatically over the past years. Patients diagnosed with localized disease undergo potentially curative tumor resection, while imatinib is given to high risk resected patients to prolong the time to recurrence. The advent of imatinib has improved the prognosis of patients with unresectable or metastatic disease to a five-year median overall survival. Unresectable or metastatic patients typically receive imatinib, followed by sunitinib and regorafenib as the disease progresses.
GIST is a tumor type that depends on continued signaling of a single, aberrantly active kinase. About 5 to 6 percent of primary GIST cases are caused by a PDGFRA D842V mutation, the most common PDGFRA exon 18 mutation. Published data have shown poor outcomes in patients with PDGFRA D842V mutant GIST treated with imatinib and other approved therapies that do not specifically target PDGFRA mutations. Progression can occur within as little as three months, and the median overall survival is 15 months for patients with advanced disease. Currently, AYVAKIT is the only FDA-approved treatment for patients with D842V mutant PDGFRA-driven GIST. 
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and HCC accounts for most liver cancers. The highest incidence of HCC occurs in regions with endemic hepatitis B virus, or HBV, including Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Cirrhosis is a key risk factor for HCC — the disease etiology varies by geography with the common theme of chronic conditions that lead to cirrhosis. In North America, the main risk factors for cirrhosis are infection with hepatitis C virus, or HCV, followed by HBV infection, alcohol consumption and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. In the European Union, the main risk factors for cirrhosis are HCV, HBV and alcohol consumption. In Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, the major risk factor is chronic HBV infection.
The FGFR4 signaling pathway is a potential driver of disease in a subset of HCC patients. In these patients, FGF19 (the ligand that activates FGFR4) is overexpressed in hepatocytes, which do not normally express FGF19, leading to autocrine signaling and tumor growth. We estimate that approximately 30% of patients have FGFR4-activated HCC. 
As part of our collaboration with CStone, we are evaluating fisogatinib as a monotherapy and in combination with sugemalimab for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic HCC.
Treatment-Resistant EGFR-Mutated NSCLC
Among the 80 to 85 percent of lung cancers classified as NSCLC, it is estimated that about 10-15% of cases in the U.S. and Europe and about 40-50% of cases in Asia are caused by activating EGFR mutations. In recent years, the 

18




introduction of EGFR targeted therapies including osimertinib has dramatically improved outcomes in patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC. However, the emergence of tumor resistance represents an urgent medical need and there are no approved therapies for osimertinib-resistant EGFR-mutated NSCLC. 
We are developing BLU-701 and BLU-945, each as a monotherapy and/or in combination with other agents, for the treatment of patients with treatment-resistant EGFR-mutated NSCLC. We plan to initiate a Phase 1 trial of BLU-701 in patients with treatment-resistant EGFR-driven NSCLC by the end of 2021, and to initiate a Phase 1 trial of BLU-945 in patients with treatment-resistant EGFR-driven NSCLC in the first half of 2021.
Collaborations and Licenses
Roche – Immunotherapy Collaboration
In March 2016, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement, or the Roche immunotherapy agreement, as may be amended from time to time, with Roche for the discovery, development and commercialization of small molecule therapeutics targeting kinases believed to be important in cancer immunotherapy, as single products or possibly in combination with other therapeutics. As a result of an amendment to the Roche immunotherapy agreement in the first quarter of 2021, we and Roche are currently conducting activities for up to two programs under the collaboration, including the previously announced program for the kinase target MAP4K1, which is believed to play a role in T cell regulation.
 Under the Roche immunotherapy agreement, as amended, Roche was granted two option rights to obtain an exclusive license to exploit products derived from the collaboration programs in the field of cancer immunotherapy. Such option rights are triggered upon the achievement of Phase 1 proof-of-concept. For one of the collaboration programs, if Roche exercises its option, Roche will receive worldwide, exclusive commercialization rights for the licensed product. For the other collaboration program, if Roche exercises its option, we will retain commercialization rights in the U.S. for the licensed product, and Roche will receive commercialization rights outside of the U.S. for the licensed product. We will also retain worldwide rights to any products for which Roche elects not to exercise its applicable option.
Prior to Roche’s exercise of an option, we have the lead responsibility for drug discovery and pre-clinical development of all collaboration programs. In addition, we have the lead responsibility for the conduct of all Phase 1 clinical trials other than those Phase 1 clinical trials for any product in combination with Roche’s portfolio of therapeutics, for which Roche will have the right to lead the conduct of such Phase 1 clinical trials. Pursuant to the Roche immunotherapy agreement, the parties share the costs of Phase 1 development for each collaboration program. In addition, Roche will be responsible for post-Phase 1 development costs for each licensed product for which it retains global commercialization rights, and we and Roche will share post-Phase 1 development costs for each licensed product for which we retain commercialization rights in the U.S.
We received an upfront cash payment of $45.0 million in March 2016 upon execution of the Roche immunotherapy agreement, and through December 31, 2020, we have achieved $19.5 million in milestone payments under this collaboration. Subject to the terms of the Roche immunotherapy agreement, as amended, in addition to upfront and milestone payments received through December 31, 2020, we are eligible to receive up to approximately $323.3 million in contingent option fees and milestone payments related to specified research, pre-clinical, clinical, regulatory and sales-based milestones. In addition, for any licensed product for which Roche retains worldwide commercialization rights, we will be eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging from low double-digits to high-teens on future net sales of the licensed product. For any licensed product for which we retain commercialization rights in the U.S., we and Roche will be eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging from mid-single-digits to low double-digits on future net sales in the other party’s respective territories in which it commercializes the licensed product. The upfront cash payment and any payments for milestones, option fees and royalties are non-refundable, non-creditable and not subject to set-off.
Under the Roche immunotherapy agreement, each party has granted the other party specified intellectual property licenses to enable the other party to perform its obligations and exercise its rights under the Roche immunotherapy agreement, including license grants to enable each party to conduct research, development and commercialization activities pursuant to the terms of the Roche immunotherapy agreement. Following Roche’s exercise 

19




of its option with respect to the collaboration programs for which it will obtain worldwide rights, we will grant Roche an exclusive license under our intellectual property to develop and commercialize the licensed products generated through such collaboration program. Similarly, Roche will grant us an exclusive license under Roche’s intellectual property to develop and commercialize licensed products in the U.S. for the collaboration programs on which we will retain rights in the U.S., with Roche receiving a license under our intellectual property to develop and commercialize such licensed products outside of the U.S. 
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Roche immunotherapy agreement, we have agreed to work exclusively with Roche with respect to each collaboration target. We are not obligated to work exclusively with Roche within the field of cancer immunotherapy. In addition, subject to specified exceptions, Roche has a right of first negotiation in the event that we desire to grant any third party rights to develop or commercialize a licensed product for which we retain commercialization rights in the U.S. Roche’s right of first negotiation will not apply in connection with a change of control of us, an assignment by us in accordance with the terms of the Roche immunotherapy agreement or certain agreements with contract research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations, academic institutions, not-for-profit third parties or distributors. 
The Roche immunotherapy agreement will continue until the date when no royalty or other payment obligations are or will become due, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of the Roche immunotherapy agreement. Prior to its exercise of its first option, Roche may terminate the Roche immunotherapy agreement at will, in whole or on a collaboration target-by-collaboration target basis, upon 120 days’ prior written notice to us. Following its exercise of an option, Roche may terminate the Roche immunotherapy agreement at will, in whole, on a collaboration target-by-collaboration target basis, on a collaboration program-by-collaboration program basis or, if a licensed product has been commercially sold, on a country-by-country basis, (i) upon 120 days’ prior written notice if a licensed product has not been commercially sold or (ii) upon 180 days’ prior written notice if a licensed product has been commercially sold. Either party may terminate the Roche immunotherapy agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or insolvency and in certain other circumstances agreed to by the parties. In certain termination circumstances, we are entitled to retain specified licenses to be able to continue to exploit the licensed products.
Roche – Pralsetinib Collaboration
On July 13, 2020, we entered into a collaboration agreement, or the Roche pralsetinib collaboration agreement, with Roche pursuant to which we granted Roche exclusive rights to develop and commercialize pralsetinib worldwide, excluding the CStone territory, and a co-exclusive license in the U.S. to develop and commercialize pralsetinib. In addition, Roche has the right to opt in to a next-generation RET compound co-developed by Roche and us.
Under the Roche pralsetinib collaboration agreement, we received upfront cash payments of $775.0 million in the third quarter of 2020, including an upfront payment of $675.0 million and the $100.0 million equity investment by Roche described below. Through December 31, 2020, we have received $55.0 million in specified regulatory and commercialization milestones. In addition to the upfront and milestone payments received through December 31, 2020, we are eligible to receive up to $872.0 million in contingent payments, including specified development, regulatory and sales-based milestones for pralsetinib and any licensed product containing a next-generation RET compound. 
In the U.S., we and Roche are working together to co-commercialize pralsetinib and will equally share responsibilities, profits and losses. In addition, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging from high-teens to mid-twenties on annual net sales of pralsetinib outside the U.S., excluding the CStone territory, which we refer to as the Roche territory. We and Roche have also agreed to co-develop pralsetinib globally in RET-altered solid tumors, including NSCLC, MTC and other thyroid cancers, as well as other solid tumors. We and Roche will share global development costs for pralsetinib at a rate of 45 percent for us and 55 percent for Roche up to a specified amount of aggregate joint development costs, after which our share of global development costs for pralsetinib will be reduced by a specified percentage. We and Roche will also share specified global development costs for any next-generation RET compound co-developed under the collaboration in a similar manner.
Unless earlier terminated in accordance with its terms, the Roche pralsetinib collaboration agreement will expire on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis (i) in the U.S. upon the expiration of the gross profit sharing term for such licensed product and (ii) outside the U.S. on a country-by-country basis at the end of the applicable royalty term for such licensed product. Roche may terminate the agreement in its entirety or on a licensed product-by-licensed 

20




product or country-by-country basis subject to certain notice periods. Either party may terminate the Roche pralsetinib collaboration agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or insolvency. Subject to the terms of the Roche pralsetinib collaboration agreement, effective upon termination of the agreement, we are entitled to retain specified licenses to be able to continue to exploit the licensed products.
In connection with the Roche collaboration agreement, on July 13, 2020, we also entered into a stock purchase agreement with Roche Holdings, Inc., or Roche Holdings, pursuant to which we issued and sold an aggregate of 1,035,519 of shares of common stock to Roche Holdings at a purchase price of $96.57 per share and received $100.0 million in the third quarter of 2020. The closing for a minority portion of the equity investment occurred following the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and other customary closing conditions.

Clementia may terminate the agreement at any time on or after October 15, 2021 upon at least 12 months’ prior written notice to us. Either party may terminate the agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or insolvency and in certain other circumstances agreed to by the parties. In certain termination circumstances, we are entitled to retain specified licenses to be able to continue to exploit the Clementia licensed products.
Intellectual Property 
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary or intellectual property protection for our drug and drug candidates, as well as our core technologies, including our novel target discovery engine, our proprietary compound library, and other know-how; to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others; and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary or intellectual property rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary and intellectual property position by, among other methods, filing U.S., international and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position.
We file patent applications directed to AYVAKIT/AYVAKYT, GAVRETO and our drug candidates in an effort to establish intellectual property positions regarding these new chemical entities as well as uses of these new chemical entities in the treatment of diseases and to other technologies, including patient selection markers and diagnostic discoveries that may be useful with our drug and drug candidates. We also file patent applications directed to novel fusions that we have discovered through our target discovery engine and the use of these fusions in diagnosing and treating disease. As of January 31, 2021, we owned 35 issued U.S. patents, 16 pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, six pending U.S. provisional applications, 51 issued foreign patents, 107 foreign pending patent applications, and seven pending Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, international patent applications. The foreign issued patents and patent applications are in a number of jurisdictions, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, Gulf Cooperation Council, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, 

22




Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, and Taiwan. Our issued patents and pending patent applications pertain to our pipeline, including our programs for avapritinib, pralsetinib, fisogatinib, BLU-263 as well as additional kinase discovery programs and novel recurrent fusions. 
The intellectual property portfolios for our approved drugs and clinical-stage drug candidates as of January 31, 2021 are summarized below. Prosecution is a lengthy process, during which the scope of the claims initially submitted for examination by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and by patent offices in other countries are often significantly narrowed by the time they issue, if they issue at all. We expect this to be the case with respect to our pending patent applications referred to below.
KIT and PDGFRA Program—AYVAKIT/AYVAKYT (avapritinib) and BLU-263 
The intellectual property portfolio for our KIT and PDGFRA program contains patent applications directed to compositions of matter for avapritinib, BLU-263 and analogs thereof, compositions of matter for KIT and PDGFRA inhibitors with different compound families, as well as methods of use and manufacture. As of January 31, 2021, we owned 11 issued U.S. patents, 15 issued foreign patents, including one European patent validated in 38 countries, three pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, three pending U.S. provisional applications, five pending PCT international patent applications and 22 pending foreign patent applications directed to our KIT and PDGFRA program, including avapritinib and BLU-263. The patents that have issued or will issue covering our KIT and PDGFRA program will have a statutory expiration date between 2034 and 2041. Patent term adjustments or patent term extensions could result in later expiration dates. 
RET Program—GAVRETO (pralsetinib)
The intellectual property portfolio for our RET program contains patent applications directed to compositions of matter for pralsetinib and analogs and compositions of matter for RET inhibitors with different compound families, as well as methods of use. As of January 31, 2021, we owned seven issued U.S. patents, six pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, three pending U.S. provisional applications, one pending PCT international application, 53 pending foreign patent applications and four issued foreign patents directed to our RET program, including pralsetinib. The patents that have issued or will issue covering our RET program will have a statutory expiration date between 2036 and 2041. Patent term adjustments or patent term extensions could result in later expiration dates.
FGFR4 Program — Fisogatinib
The intellectual property portfolio for our FGFR4 program contains patent applications directed to compositions of matter for fisogatinib and analogs and compositions of matter for FGFR4 inhibitors with different compound families as well as methods of use. As of January 31, 2021, we owned nine issued U.S. patents, two pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, one pending PCT international application, 28 pending foreign patent applications and 27 issued foreign patents directed to our FGFR4 program, including fisogatinib. The patents that have issued or will issue covering our FGFR4 program will have a statutory expiration date between 2033 and 2040. Patent term adjustments or patent term extensions could result in later expiration dates.
Platform
The intellectual property portfolio directed to our platform includes patent applications directed to novel gene fusions and the uses of these fusions for detecting and treating conditions implicated with these fusions. As of January 31, 2021, we owned eight issued U.S. patents, five pending U.S. patent applications, four pending European Union patent applications and five issued European patents directed to this technology, which, if issued, will have statutory expiration dates ranging from 2034 to 2035.
Other Considerations
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the U.S., the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the U.S., a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which 

23




compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent that covers a drug or biological product may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. See “— Government Regulation — U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity” below for additional information on such exclusivity. In the future, if applicable and when our drug candidates receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those drugs, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each drug and other factors. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustment to the term of any of our patents.
As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our drug, drug candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, our pending patent applications, and any patent applications that we may in the future file or license from third parties may not result in the issuance of patents. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. Any issued patents that we may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. For example, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending third-party patent applications. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the U.S. that also claim technology or therapeutics to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial costs to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us, which is highly unpredictable. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug or drug candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our approved drugs or drug candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby limiting protection such patent would afford the respective product and any competitive advantage such patent may provide.
In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by executing confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, third-party service providers, and scientific advisors, and non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality, and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We have also executed agreements requiring assignment of inventions with selected scientific advisors, consultants and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements we enter into are designed to protect our proprietary information and the agreements or clauses requiring assignment of inventions to us are designed to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through our relationship with the respective counterparty. We cannot guarantee, however, that these agreements will afford us adequate protection of our intellectual property and proprietary information rights.
With respect to the building of our proprietary compound library, we consider trade secrets and know-how to be our primary intellectual property. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. In particular, we anticipate that with respect to our discovery platform, these trade secrets and know-how will over time be disseminated within the industry through independent development and public presentations describing the methodology.
Competition
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary drugs. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions worldwide. Any drug or drug candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing drugs and new drugs that may become available in the future.
We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that address inhibition of kinases in cancer and other rare diseases. There are other companies working to develop therapies in the field of kinase inhibition for cancer and other diseases. These companies include divisions of large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies of various sizes.

24




Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any drugs that we or our collaborators may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we or our collaborators are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of our drugs and our current or future drug candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostic tests in guiding the use of related therapeutics, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Our approved drugs and drug candidates, to the extent they receive marketing approval in the future for indications for which we are currently conducting or planning clinical trials, compete with or will compete with the drugs discussed below and will likely compete with other drugs that are currently in development.
SM
We are developing avapritinib for SM, including advanced SM and non-advanced SM, and we are developing BLU-263 for the treatment of non-advanced SM and other mast cell disorders. If avapritinib receives marketing approval for advanced SM, it will face competition from Novartis AG’s midostaurin and imatinib. In addition, if avapritinib or BLU-263 are approved for advanced SM or non-advanced SM, they may face competition from other drug candidates in development for these indications, including those being developed by AB Science S.A., Allakos Inc. and Cogent Biosciences, Inc. 
RET-altered Cancers
GAVRETO faces competition for RET fusion-positive NSCLC and RET-altered thyroid carcinoma, including MTC, from Eli Lilly and Company’s selpercatinib. If pralsetinib receives marketing approval for patients with other solid tumors, it will also face competition from selpercatinib for these additional indications. In addition, pralsetinib may face competition from other drug candidates in development for RET-altered cancers, including those being developed by AstraZeneca plc, Boston Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Eisai Inc., Exelixis, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Mirati Therapeutics, Inc., Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc. Roche, Stemline Therapeutics, Inc., and Turning Point Therapeutics, Inc., as well as several approved multi-kinase inhibitors with RET activity being evaluated in clinical trials, including alectinib, apatinib, cabozantinib, dovitinib, lenvatinib, sorafenib, sunitinib and vandetinib.
GIST
AYVAKIT/AYVAKYT may face competition from drug candidates in development for PDGFRA-driven GIST, including those being developed by AB Science S.A., ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, AROG Pharmaceuticals, Inc., AstraZeneca plc, Celldex Therapeutics, Inc., Cogent Biosciences, Inc., Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, LLC, Exelixis, Inc., Ningbo Tai Kang Medical Technology Co. Ltd. and Xencor, Inc.
HCC
We are developing fisogatinib for patients with advanced HCC. If fisogatinib receives marketing approval for patients with FGFR4-activated HCC, it will face competition from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s nivolumab and 

25




Merck & Co., Inc.’s pembrolizumab, immune checkpoint inhibitors approved by the FDA for the treatment of HCC, as well as sorafenib, cabozantinib, regorafenib and lenvatinib, multi-kinase inhibitors approved for the treatment of HCC. In addition, fisogatinib may face competition from other drug candidates in development by Abbisko Therapeutics Co., Ltd, AstraZeneca plc, Bayer AG, Celgene Corporation, Eisai Inc., H3 Biomedicine Inc., Incyte Corporation, Johnson & Johnson, Novartis AG, Sanofi S.A., Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., U3 Pharma GmbH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited, and Xoma Ltd.
Treatment-Resistant EGFR-Mutated NSCLC 
We are developing drug candidates for treatment-resistant EGFR-mutated NSCLC, which, if approved, will face competition from AstraZeneca plc’s osimertinib and almonertinib, which is under collaboration between Jiangsu Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd. and EQRX, Inc. and approved in China. In addition, our EGFR inhibitors may face competition from drug candidates in development for EGFR-mutated NSCLC, including those being developed by Alpha Biopharma Inc., Astellas Pharma Inc., Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH & Co KG, Bridge Biotherapeutics, Inc., C4 Therapeutics, Inc., Chia Tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical Group, Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited, Genosco Inc., Genprex, Inc., Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Yuhan Corporation.
Commercialization 
As a fully-integrated, global precision therapy company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing a portfolio of precision therapies, our vision is to bring life-changing precision therapies to as many patients with cancer and hematologic disorders as possible. We have established our own commercial organization in the U.S. and Europe in connection with our commercial launches of AYVAKIT and GAVRETO in the U.S. and AYVAKYT in Europe. We have also entered into collaborations with our partners, including CStone and Roche, for planned global commercialization activities for AYVAKIT/AYVAKYT and GAVRETO in their respective territories. We are continuing to expand our commercialization capabilities and to build our distribution capabilities to accelerate global adoption of our approved drugs and to prepare for additional planned commercial launches with an initial focus on the U.S. and Europe. 
We believe our portfolio strategy focused on genomically defined cancers and hematologic disorders will allow us to efficiently commercialize approved drugs in the U.S. and Europe initially and worldwide longer-term, using a small and highly specialized sales force similar to those of other rare disease companies. We may also evaluate opportunities to establish collaborations with pharmaceutical companies to leverage their capabilities to maximize the potential of our pipeline from time to time. 
Manufacturing and Supply 
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our drug candidates for pre-clinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture of any drug we may commercialize. To date, we have obtained materials for avapritinib, pralsetinib, fisogatinib, BLU-263 and BLU-945 for our ongoing and planned clinical testing from third-party manufacturers. We obtain our supplies from these manufacturers on a purchase order basis and do not have a long-term supply arrangement in place. Although we have negotiated manufacturing agreements with certain venders for the commercial supply of AYVAKIT/AYVAKYT and GAVRETO, we may also obtain our supplies for these approved drugs from these manufacturers on a purchase order basis from time to time. We rely primarily on single-source third-party suppliers to manufacture and supply our drugs and may from time to time explore opportunities to identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide the API, drug substance and drug products.
All of our approved drugs and drug candidates are compounds of low molecular weight, generally called small molecules. They can be manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. The chemistry is amenable to scale-up and does not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue developing drug candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.
Under the terms of our agreements related to the development and commercialization of companion diagnostic tests, third parties are responsible for the commercialization of companion diagnostic tests for avapritinib in order to 

26




identify GIST patients with the PDGFRA D842V mutation, pralsetinib in order to identify NSCLC patients with RET fusions and fisogatinib in order to identify HCC patients with FGFR4 pathway activation. We generally expect to rely on third parties for the manufacture of any other companion diagnostic tests we may seek to develop.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the U.S. at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research and clinical development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing, and export and import of drug products, such as those we are developing. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the regulatory authority’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical holds, untitled or warning letters, voluntary product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, debarment, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
U.S. Drug Development
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Our drug candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
●completion of extensive nonclinical tests, sometimes referred to as pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies performed in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
●submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be actively maintained, including by submitting 15- or 7-day safety reports and annual safety reports;
●performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND and other clinical trial-related regulations, sometimes referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its proposed indication;
●submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new drug;
●a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review; 
●review of the drug candidate by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
●payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA (unless a fee waiver applies);
●satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the API and finished drug product are produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements, where appropriate or if applicable;

27




●potential FDA audit of the pre-clinical study sites and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
●FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the U.S.

The data required to support an NDA is generated in two distinct development stages: pre-clinical and clinical. For new chemical entities, the pre-clinical development stage generally involves synthesizing the active component, developing the formulation and determining the manufacturing process, as well as carrying out non-human toxicology, pharmacology and drug metabolism studies in the laboratory, which support subsequent clinical testing. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests must comply with federal regulations, including GLPs, where applicable. The sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the pre-clinical data, general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human trials. The IND becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that could cause the trial to be suspended or terminated.
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the drug candidate to healthy volunteers and/or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
Clinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 1 clinical trials for oncology indications generally involve a small number of disease-affected patients who are treated with the drug candidate in escalating dose cohorts. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to determine the MTD, or a recommended dose if the MTD is not achieved, assess the pharmacokinetic, or PK, profile, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug. Phase 1 clinical trials for oncology indications may also evaluate preliminary evidence of clinical activity. Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further PK and PD information is collected, as well as identification of possible adverse effects and safety risks and preliminary evaluation of efficacy. Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve large numbers of patients (from several hundred to several thousand subjects) at multiple sites, in multiple countries and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug for its intended use, its safety in use, and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the drug and provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase 3 clinical trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a drug during marketing. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA. However, in settings of rare diseases and genetically-driven cancers, regulatory flexibility is given on a case-by-case basis.
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic 

28




indication. In certain instances, FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as post-marketing commitments or requirements.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any finding from other clinical studies, tests in laboratory animals, or in vitro testing that suggests a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. In addition, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, cGMPs impose extensive procedural, substantive and recordkeeping requirements to ensure and preserve the long-term stability and quality of the final drug product. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
NDA and FDA Review Process
Following trial completion, trial data are analyzed to assess safety and efficacy. The results of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, along with proposed labeling for the drug and information about the manufacturing process and facilities that will be used to ensure drug quality, results of analytical testing conducted on the chemistry of the drug, and other relevant information. The NDA is a request for approval to market the drug and must contain adequate evidence of safety and efficacy, which is demonstrated by extensive pre-clinical and clinical testing. The application includes both negative or ambiguous results of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a use of a drug, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be offered for sale in the U.S.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, as amended, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA’s fiscal year 2021 fee schedule, effective through September 30, 2021, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as an NDA, is $2,875,842. PDUFA also imposes an annual prescription drug product program fee for human drugs ($336,432 for the current fiscal year). Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. In addition, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, for a new molecular entity the FDA has ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the 

29




filing date for a priority NDA. The submission of a major amendment at any time during the review cycle may extend the PDUFA action date by up to three months. Only one extension can be given per review cycle. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed drug is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the drug is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drugs or drug candidates that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA will likely re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and us during the review process. The review and evaluation of an NDA by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete, and we may not receive a timely approval, if at all.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new drug to determine whether they comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the drug unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the drug within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA may also audit data from clinical trials by inspecting the sponsor or clinical trial sites to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. After the FDA evaluates the application, manufacturing process and manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its API will be produced, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter or defer action on an application where required inspections cannot be conducted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, pre-clinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, withdraw the application or request a hearing. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
There is no assurance that the FDA will ultimately approve a drug product for marketing in the U.S. and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs during the review process. If a drug receives marketing approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the drug. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the drug labeling or may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-market testing or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved drugs. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved drugs that have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of drugs. Drug approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing.
Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs
The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, accelerated approval, priority review and breakthrough therapy designation, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA 

30




review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. To be eligible for fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a drug is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and based on pre-clinical or preliminary clinical data demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors.
The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. These six- and ten-month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Products that are eligible for fast track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
In addition, drugs studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures.
Moreover, a sponsor can request designation of a drug candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval and priority review. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation, do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.
Pediatric Trials
A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from pre-clinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs.

31




Post-Marketing Requirements
Following approval of a new drug, a pharmaceutical company and the approved drug are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the drug, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, drug sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling, which is known as “off-label use”, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. There are also limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Modifications or enhancements to the drug or its labeling or changes of the site of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, which may or may not be received or may result in a lengthy review process. Any distribution of prescription drugs and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or the PDMA, a part of the FDCA.
In the U.S., once a drug is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by the FDA. The FDA regulations require that drugs be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our drugs in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute drugs manufactured, processed or tested by them. Discovery of problems with a drug after approval may result in restrictions on a drug, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the drug from the market, and may require substantial resources to correct.
The FDA also may require post-approval commitments, which may include testing that are sometimes referred to as post-marketing studies or clinical studies, risk minimization action plans and post-marketing surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved drug or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the drug. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, untitled or warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a drug’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. The distribution of pharmaceutical drugs is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical drugs.
Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our drugs under development.
Other Regulatory Matters
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following drug approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the U.S., the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration for controlled substances, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational 

32




Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments. In the U.S., sales, marketing and scientific/educational programs must also comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act. If drugs are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. Drugs must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
The failure to comply with regulatory requirements and changes to regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. In addition, even if a firm complies with FDA and other requirements, new information regarding the safety or efficacy of a product could lead the FDA to modify or withdraw product approval. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
Marketing exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the pre-clinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Orphan drug exclusivity, as described below, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the U.S. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.

33




Orphan Drug Designation
The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and marketing the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. In the European Union, the European Commission, after receiving the opinion of the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP, grants medicinal product designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union Community. In addition, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the drug or biological product.
In the U.S., orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity.
In the European Union, medicinal product designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following drug or biological product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the medicinal product designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
Rare Pediatric Disease Designation and Priority Review Vouchers 
Under the FDCA, the FDA incentivizes the development of drugs products that meet the definition of a “rare pediatric disease,” defined to mean a serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious of life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years and the disease affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or affects more than 200,000 in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making in the United States a drug product for such disease or condition will be received from sales in the United States of such drug product. The sponsor of a product candidate for a rare pediatric disease may be eligible for a voucher that can be used to obtain a priority review for a subsequent human drug product application after the date of approval of the rare pediatric disease drug product, referred to as a priority review voucher, or PRV. A sponsor may request rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA prior to the submission of its NDA. A rare pediatric disease designation does not guarantee that a sponsor will receive a PRV upon approval of its NDA. Moreover, a sponsor who chooses not to submit a rare pediatric disease designation request may nonetheless receive a PRV upon approval of their marketing application if they request such a voucher in their original marketing application and meet all of the eligibility criteria. If a PRV is received, it may be sold or transferred an unlimited number of times. Congress has extended the PRV program through September 30, 2024, with the potential for PRVs to be granted through September 30, 2026.
Regulation of Diagnostic Tests
We expect that our drug candidates may require use of a diagnostic to identify appropriate patient populations for our products. These diagnostics, often referred to as companion diagnostic tests, are medical devices, often in vitro devices, which provide information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding drug. For example, we have entered into agreements with third parties to develop and commercialize companion diagnostic tests for avapritinib in order to identify GIST patients with the PDGFRA D842V mutation, pralsetinib in order to identify NSCLC patients with RET fusions and fisogatinib in order to identify HCC patients with FGFR4 pathway activation. In the U.S., the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among 

34




other things, medical device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, establishment registration and device listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, or PMA approval. We expect that any companion diagnostic test developed for our drug candidates will utilize the PMA pathway.
PMA applications must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, pre-clinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA application typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. FDA review of an initial PMA may require several years to complete. If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
On August 6, 2014, the FDA issued a final guidance document addressing the development and approval process for “In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.” According to the guidance, for novel drugs such as our drug candidates, a companion diagnostic test device and its corresponding drug should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product labeling. The guidance also explains that a companion diagnostic test device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a drug generally will be considered an investigational device, unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulations. Thus, the sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a drug are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same investigational study, if the study meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the study plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND alone, or both an IND and an IDE.
In the European Economic Area, or EEA (which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), in vitro medical devices are required to conform with the essential requirements of the E.U. Directive on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (Directive No 98/79/EC, as amended). To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements, the manufacturer must undergo a conformity assessment procedure. The conformity assessment varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. For low-risk devices, the conformity assessment can be carried out internally, but for higher risk devices it requires the intervention of an accredited EEA Notified Body. If successful, the conformity assessment concludes with the drawing up by the manufacturer of an EC Declaration of Conformity entitling the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its products and to sell them throughout the EEA.
European Drug Development
In the European Union, our future drugs may also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the U.S., medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.

35




Similar to the U.S., the various phases of pre-clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the current EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, or Clinical Trials Directive, has sought to harmonize the European Union clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the European Union, the European Union Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the European Union countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
In April 2014, the European Union adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, or the Clinical Trials Regulation, which is set to replace the Clinical Trials Directive. It is expected that the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 will apply following confirmation of full functionality of the Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS), the centralized European Union portal and database for clinical trials foreseen by the regulation, through an independent audit. The regulation becomes applicable six months after the European Commission publishes notice of this confirmation The Clinical Trials Regulation will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the European Union. Specifically, the new legislation, which will be directly applicable in all member states, aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. For instance, the new Clinical Trials Regulation provides for a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications.
European Drug Review and Approval
In the United Kingdom and the EEA, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations:
The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of drugs, such as biotechnology medicinal drugs, orphan medicinal drugs, and medicinal drugs containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for drugs containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for drugs that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union.
National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for drugs not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a drug has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the drug has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the drug characteristics, or SPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the drug is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e. in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).
Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the drug on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
​

36




European Pediatric Investigation Plan
In the EEA, MAAs for new medicinal products have to include the results of studies conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, agreed with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or PDCO. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when this data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. If a marketing authorization is obtained and trial results are included in the product information, even when negative, the product is eligible for six-months’ supplementary protection certificate extension. In the case of orphan medicinal products, a two-year extension of the orphan market exclusivity may be available. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.
European Chemical Entity Exclusivity
In the European Union, new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
Rest of the World Regulation
For other countries outside of the European Union and the U.S., such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, drug licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
Pharmaceutical companies may be subject to U.S. federal and state health information privacy, security and data breach notification laws, which may govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. State laws may be more stringent, broader in scope or offer greater individual rights with respect to protected health information, or PHI, than the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and its implanting regulations, which are collectively referred to as HIPAA, and state laws may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured PHI, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance.
Many state laws govern the privacy of personal information in specified circumstances. For example, in California the California Consumer Protection Act, or CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information, establishing new data privacy rights for consumers in the State of California, imposing special rules on the collection of consumer 

37




data from minors, and creating a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. While clinical trial data and information governed by HIPAA are currently exempt from the current version of the CCPA, other personal information may be applicable and possible changes to the CCPA may broaden its scope.
European Union member states, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and other jurisdictions have also adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. In the EEA and the United Kingdom, the collection and use of personal data, including clinical trial data, is governed by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. The GDPR, together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the EU member states and the United Kingdom governing the processing of personal data, impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. In particular, these obligations and restrictions concern the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the transfer of personal data out of the EEA or the United Kingdom, security breach notifications, security and confidentiality of the personal data and imposition of substantial potential fines for breaches of the data protection obligations. European data protection authorities may interpret the GDPR and national laws differently and impose additional requirements, which add to the complexity of processing personal data in or from the EEA or United Kingdom. Guidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of our drugs will depend, in part, on the extent to which our drugs will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. In the U.S. and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Thus, even if a drug is approved, sales of the drug will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the U.S. such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. In the U.S., no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. The insurance coverage and reimbursement status of newly-approved products is uncertain. Failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for any of our drug candidates, if approved, could limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability to generate revenue. Further, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of individuals have lost or will be losing employer-based insurance coverage, which may adversely affect our ability to commercialize our drugs.
These third-party payors are increasingly reducing or restricting reimbursements for medical drugs and services. In addition, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic drugs. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our drug candidates, if approved, or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our drug candidates could reduce physician usage of such drugs and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not 

38




necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for drugs for which we receive marketing approval. Any negotiated prices for our drugs covered by a Part D prescription drug plan may be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. The plan for the research was published in 2012 by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our drug candidates, if any such drug or the condition that they are intended to treat is the subject of a trial. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s drug could adversely affect the sales of our drug candidate. If third-party payors do not consider our drugs to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our drugs after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our drugs on a profitable basis.
The Affordable Care Act has had a significant impact on the health care industry. The Affordable Care Act expanded coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (increased to 70% pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, effective as of January 1, 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. 
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the U.S. since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, started in April 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act, as well as subsequent legislation, these reductions have been suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Proposed legislation, if passed, would extend this suspension until the end of the pandemic. 
The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TJCA, includes a provision repealing the individual mandate, effective January 1, 2019. On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional, and remanded the case to the lower court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the full Affordable Care Act. On March 2, 2020, the United States Supreme Court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari to review this case, and held oral arguments on November 10, 2020. Pending a decision, the Affordable Care Act remains in effect, but it is unclear at this time what effect these developments will have on the status of the Affordable Care Act. Further, on January 20, 2017, U.S. former President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On October 13, 2017, former President Trump signed an Executive Order terminating the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the Affordable Care Act. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating these subsidies, but on October 25, 2017, a federal judge in 

39




California denied their request for a restraining order. On August 14, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in two separate cases that the federal government is liable for the full amount of unpaid cost-sharing reduction, or CSR, payments for the years preceding and including 2017. For CSR claims made by health insurance companies for years 2018 and later, further litigation will be required to determine the amounts due, if any. Further, on June 14, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in Affordable Care Act risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued the payments were owed to them. This decision was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which on April 27, 2020, reversed the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit’s decision and remanded the case to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, concluding the government has an obligation to pay these risk corridor payments under the relevant formula. The effects of this gap in reimbursement on third-party payors, the viability of the ACA marketplace, providers, and potentially our business, are not yet known. While any legislative and regulatory changes will likely take time to develop, and may or may not have an impact on the regulatory regime to which we are subject, we cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on us.
In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal drugs for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal drugs for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal drug or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal drug on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical drugs will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our drugs. Historically, drugs launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally tend to be significantly lower.
Other Healthcare Laws
We may also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments where we may market our drug candidates, if approved. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions and, in some cases, may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
In addition, the civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the U.S., for example, in connection with the promotion of drug for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
HIPAA also created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party 

40




payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
There has also been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposes new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Drug manufacturers are required to submit annual reports to the CMS, which publicly posts the data on its website. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians.
We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, collectively referred to as HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, we may be subject to state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Human Capital Resources 
We provide an inclusive, collaborative and safe work environment for our employees, who enjoy innovative work and development opportunities. As of January 31, 2021, we had 429 full- and part-time employees globally, approximately 406 of whom are employed in the U.S. and approximately 23 are employed in foreign countries. Of those employees, 224 are engaged in research and development activities and 246 hold M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. To allow us flexibility in meeting varying workflow demands, we also engage consultants and temporary workers when needed.
We believe our employees are among the most important assets to our company and are key to achieving our goals and expectations. Accordingly, we focus significant attention on attracting and retaining talented individuals. Our management teams and function leaders regularly review employee engagement and satisfaction surveys and monitor employee turnover rates. To recruit and retain our employees, we offer robust compensation packages, including competitive base pay, incentive compensation and equity programs, and provide a broad range of benefits, including 401(k) plan (pension outside the U.S.), healthcare and insurance benefits, paid time off, paid family and medical leave, flexible work schedules, and various innovative health and wellness programs. In addition, we are committed to the professional development of our employees, who can take advantage of various learning opportunities, such as our mentorship, lunch & learn and skill builder accelerator programs, as well as various training programs. 
None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Outside the U.S., our employees in France, Germany and Italy, respectively, are covered by a collective agreement applicable to our industry as required by applicable local law. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
