Item 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 
Prior to February 12, 2021, we were a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.  On February 12, 2021, we completed the Business Combination pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement dated November 19, 2020 that we entered into with Legacy Butterfly. Upon the completion of the Business Combination, we changed our name to “Butterfly Network, Inc.” and the business of Legacy Butterfly became our business.
 
We are an innovative digital health business with a mission of democratizing healthcare by making medical imaging accessible to everyone around the world. Powered by our proprietary Ultrasound-on-Chip™ technology, our solution addresses the needs of point of care imaging with a unique combination of software and hardware technology. Butterfly iQ, followed by our recently launched Butterfly iQ+, is our first product powered by Butterfly’s Ultrasound-on-Chip™, and is the only ultrasound transducer that can perform “whole-body imaging” in a single handheld probe using semiconductor technology. Our Ultrasound-on-Chip™ reduces the cost of manufacturing, while our software is intended to make the product easy to use and fully integrated with the clinical workflow, accessible on a user’s smartphone, tablet, and almost any hospital computer system connected to the Internet. Through our portable proprietary, handheld solution, protected by a robust intellectual property portfolio and empowered in part by its proprietary software and Artificial Intelligence (“AI”), Butterfly aims to enable earlier detection throughout the body and remote management of health conditions around the world.
 
Digital health is systematically changing the way healthcare practitioners deliver care by increasing access and significantly reducing patient care costs. Butterfly iQ+ is designed for this new wave of medical care with an easy-to-use interface that portrays ultrasound images on your smartphone in real-time. Historically, the global ultrasound market has been dominated by traditional cart-based devices. These devices are accessible only to highly specialized, highly trained technicians and are located predominantly in hospitals, imaging centers, and physicians’ offices. Many healthcare institutions throughout the world lack the facilities and capital necessary to acquire and maintain expensive cart-based devices and cannot afford the highly trained individuals required to operate them. Traditional cart-based equipment typically ranges from $45,000 to $60,000 per new device in the mid-range and is required to be operated by trained healthcare professionals. More recently, we have seen the introduction of Point-of-Care Ultrasound (“POCUS”) devices with an average price point of $21,000, based on $5,000 to $7,000 per probe, generally requiring two to three probes to cover a comparable range of cleared indications to the single probe Butterfly iQ+. However, these POCUS devices are limited by their application of the same 60 year-old piezoelectric crystal technology with which the traditional cart-based devices operate, leaving limited opportunity for future progress. Although still required to be operated by trained healthcare practitioners, we believe that Butterfly iQ+ is the next generation of point-of-care devices that will further drive costs down and expand the current approximately $8 billion ultrasound imaging market.
 
In 2018, Legacy Butterfly commercially launched Butterfly iQ, the world’s first handheld, single-probe, whole-body ultrasound system using semiconductor technology that is commercially available, and in 2020, Legacy Butterfly launched the Butterfly iQ+ with additional features and improved performance. Since then, the Butterfly iQ and Butterfly iQ+ has been shipped to more than 30,000 medical professionals globally. Butterfly iQ+’s price through our eCommerce website is $1,999 per device, making it a high-quality and affordable alternative to the costly traditional cart-based equipment and other handheld devices currently on the market. Powered by our Ultrasound-on-Chip™, Butterfly’s high-performance imaging capabilities support fast and confident clinical decision-making. Butterfly iQ+ is comprised of both durable hardware and dynamic software solutions designed to make ultrasound imaging accessible to all healthcare practitioners, including nurses. In the future, we hope to develop and introduce an even more advanced product that can ultimately be used by patients to self-scan ultrasound images with a device and transfer these images to doctors electronically in real-time.
 
The Butterfly iQ+ is an affordable solution that is designed to help healthcare practitioners save time in their diagnosis and treatment of patients, not only improving overall patient outcomes but also increasing direct revenue per patient encounter while reducing the need for external imaging or specialist referrals. We believe the adoption of the Butterfly iQ and iQ+ device by healthcare practitioners is a positive for all healthcare system stakeholders. Through our ongoing collaborations with the healthcare community, we are continuing to optimize our software ecosystem, including by harnessing AI to develop additional clinical and product advancements for our users. We believe that these efforts could drive ease-of-use for image acquisition, improve analysis, and expand its most utilized features with extensive quality control. Our AI has and is expected to continue to allow us to develop programs that guide and educate healthcare practitioners on how to utilize the Butterfly iQ+ device, with the goal of improving their clinical impact and productivity globally.

Legacy Butterfly received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in 2017 for the Butterfly iQ, which was commercially launched in 2018, and thereafter commercially launched the Butterfly iQ+ under the same 510(k) in 2020. Our ultrasound system has been cleared by the FDA for the following uses: peripheral vessel (including carotid, deep vein thrombosis and arterial studies), procedural guidance, small organs (including thyroid, scrotum and breast), cardiac, abdominal, urology, fetal/obstetric, gynecological, musculoskeletal (conventional), musculoskeletal (superficial) and opththalmic.
 
Butterfly iQ+ is commercially available in over 20 countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, throughout greater Europe and in parts of Latin America. Our commercialization strategy is predicated on three primary channels. Namely, we have an eCommerce website through which we sell our Butterfly iQ+ to healthcare practitioners in these geographies. We also have a targeted enterprise salesforce focused on large healthcare system-wide implementations. Lastly, we have distributor, veterinary and affiliate relationships to unlock additional channels to supplement our direct and eCommerce sales. We market our products through our targeted sales organization, which is engaged in sales efforts and promotional activities primarily to health systems or institutions. Outside the United States, we also market our products directly to healthcare institutions. In the United States, we sell to or have agreements in place with most of the top 100 U.S. healthcare systems. Moreover, positive feedback about Butterfly iQ+ among practitioners has historically been a significant driver of sales, as healthcare practitioners share their appreciation for Butterfly iQ within their medical communities, which has yielded a strong net promoter score. A net promoter score is a metric used as a measure of customer satisfaction and word of mouth referrals. A strong net promoter score has been shown to correlate with revenue growth relative to competitors. We calculate our net promoter score by asking our customers the following question: “How likely are you to recommend Butterfly iQ to a friend or colleague” on a scale of 1 (not at all likely) through 10 (extremely likely)? Respondents rating us 6 or below are considered “Detractors,” 7 or 8 are considered “Passives,” and 9 or 10 are considered “Promoters.” To calculate our net promoter score, we subtract the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters. For example, if 50% of respondents were Promoters and 10% were Detractors, our net promoter score would be 40. We measure net promoter score continuously among cloud users by automatically sending net promoter score survey emails to these users three months after they create their Butterfly user account and every six months thereafter. Because our net promoter score is measured continuously it is subject to fluctuation; however, our net promoter score historically has remained strong. As of March 1, 2021, our net promoter score was 64 (USA) and reflects responses received since we began collecting net promoter score data in 2019, including multiple responses from users that respond to our survey over time. Net promoter scores vary broadly by industry, with averages generally ranging from 18 (health insurance) to 47 (tablet computers) based on data published in 2016 by Satmetrix, co-developer of Net Promoter®. Within technology industries, the top net promoter scores correspond to well-known businesses such as Amazon (66), Apple (66) and Netflix (64) according to Satmetrix. We believe that this method of calculation aligns with medical device industry standards and that this metric is meaningful for investors because of the correlation between net promoter score and future growth.
 
Outside of our core commercial geographies, Butterfly iQ+ is also being utilized in over 45 low resource settings around the world, where we have partnerships with non-governmental organizations like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to deliver our technology to underserved communities. Currently, we have over 30 global health partnerships in place with organizations that align with our mission to democratize medical imaging and bring lifesaving medical imaging to patients, often for the first time.
 
Legacy Butterfly was founded in 2011 by Dr. Jonathan Rothberg, a serial entrepreneur who received the Presidential Medal of Technology & Innovation in 2016 for inventing a novel next generation DNA sequencing method and has founded more than 10 healthcare/technology companies, including 454 Life Sciences, Ion Torrent and CuraGen. Legacy Butterfly has raised over $400 million in equity investments and partnership milestones from leading institutional investors, including Baillie Gifford, and strategic partners, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
 
Legacy Butterfly sold and shipped approximately 20,200 devices in the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase from approximately 12,900 devices in the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a growth rate of approximately 56.2% year over year. Legacy Butterfly generated total revenue of $46.3 million and $27.6 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Legacy Butterfly also incurred net losses of $162.7 million and $99.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
 
Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe that our competitive strengths include the following:
 

· | Large Global Ultrasound Market and Potential to Expand to a Larger Market of Healthcare Practitioners and Patients. We believe our solution addresses an unmet need across an addressable market of 40 million healthcare practitioners, including approximately 12 million medical doctors and approximately 28 million nurses and midwives worldwide. We believe our solution can address this market, which is significantly larger than the existing $8 billion ultrasound market, because our solution not only provides a next generation alternative to legacy cart-based systems, but more importantly empowers practitioners who desire to modernize their healthcare practice with a diagnostic device and software system that is smart, mobile, interoperable, and easy to use. Furthermore, existing handheld devices, which only comprise 3% of the global ultrasound units as of 2017, have been unable to satisfy demands of users because they are often using outdated technology, which leads to higher cost, reduced imaging capacity, lack of user-friendly interfaces, and difficulties with integration with other systems.

The low penetration from handheld devices in a sizable market provides us with significant opportunity for growth. We also believe that the portability, ease-of-use, fast frame rates and other differentiating features of our ultrasound imaging technology could be attractive to consumers. We believe our differentiated Butterfly iQ handheld device and our growing user base of Butterfly iQ practitioners, with sales to or agreements with most of the top 100 U.S. healthcare systems and across more than 40 countries, position us well to compete in the existing ultrasound market and to potentially expand into emerging markets.
 

· | Our Innovative Technology is Well-Positioned for a Health Economy Focused on Affordability and Access to Care. We believe the small, handheld size, relatively low cost, quality imaging, and interface designed for ease-of-use are attractive to healthcare systems that seek to contain healthcare costs and improve access to care, when compared to the limitations and expense of traditional cart-based systems and existing handheld devices. These attributes also allow the use of our Butterfly iQ+ by practitioners beyond traditional health system environments to pre-hospital settings, urgent care clinics, long-term care and rehabilitation centers, dialysis centers, ambulatory surgery centers, veterinary clinics and emerging markets. In time, we believe these attributes could also be attractive to health-centric consumers, which could allow us to potentially further expand beyond traditional healthcare environments to the home and alternate sites of care should appropriate marketing authorizations be obtained for such intended uses. The advantages of our technology align with recent industry trends, including the shift to in-home medical care, affordability, harnessing of AI / Big Data, collaboration through the cloud, disruptive medical innovation, and increasing access to care. In addition, by expanding the settings in which medical imaging can be done, the Butterfly iQ+ device may provide opportunities for earlier detection and prevention of disease, while reducing cost. This aligns with the focus on consumer health empowerment, wellness, and acceleration of value-based care, all of which are themes seen consistently in the healthcare industry today.

· | Our Proprietary, Disruptive and Revolutionary Product is Designed to Address an Unmet Need in the Medical Imaging Market. Legacy Butterfly is the first company to have successfully put ultrasound on a semiconductor chip. This novel and proprietary Ultrasound-on-Chip™ technology enables whole-body complete ultrasound imaging with a single probe. We are continuing to improve our software by harnessing AI with a goal to drive ease-of-use for image acquisition, improve analysis, guide and educate practitioners, and provide quality control. As a result of utilizing these technologies, our Butterfly iQ product has a small, hand-held size, low cost, and simple user interface, making ultrasound technology more accessible outside of large healthcare institutions. This contrasts sharply to existing systems that are built using often expensive piezoelectric crystal technology, which can lead to high upfront costs and thereby constrain access and usage. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Additionally, the technology driving the Butterfly iQ and Butterfly iQ+ devices may be able to continually scale and improve if Moore’s Law, which is a historical trend that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit will increase over time, remains accurate. For example, the Butterfly iQ+, which was commercially launched in October 2020, is much less expensive to produce, yet has faster frame rates and further enhanced interoperability than the Butterfly iQ, which was commercially launched in 2018, and we expect these trends to continue in future products. One aspect of our software strategy is our Software Development Kit, or SDK, which is meant to provide a governed ecosystem for third parties to create content and applications that will serve to enrich the overall software ecosystem and deliver additional clinical and product advancements for our users. To date, we are working with partners, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, to build applications on our SDK that we expect to then validate, obtain any necessary marketing authorizations for, and deploy to our users. The SDK is important to our software strategy and overall mission of democratizing medical imaging. Through these product enhancements, and SDK specifically, we believe our solution will be the primary platform for point of care ultrasound, functioning as an operating system in which new features can continually be built onto and a central component of all handheld imaging.
 
We expect to continue development of the hardware with product offerings that may include enhanced performance, improved image quality and alternative form factors.
 
Furthermore, as of December 31, 2020, we owned approximately 280 issued patents and approximately 540 pending patent applications. In total, we own approximately 175 patent families directed to its ultrasound products, including manufacturing, circuit components, and add-on features.

· | Strong Topline Growth, with Subscription-based Recurring Revenue to Enable Long-Term Expansion in Gross Margin. Since the commercial launch of the Butterfly iQ device in 2018, Legacy Butterfly has experienced strong topline growth. Legacy Butterfly’s total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $46.3 million and $27.6 million, respectively, representing an increase of $18.7 million. We continue to seek to grow our user base of Butterfly iQ practitioners and our enterprise sales to health systems to help us further penetrate the global ultrasound market. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Legacy Butterfly’s product revenue represented approximately 82.9% of its total revenue for the year, and subscription revenue represented the remaining 17.1% of its total revenue for the year. As our devices continue to be adopted by more healthcare practitioners and practitioners in the Butterfly network continue to use our devices, we expect total subscription revenue to increase and that our subscription revenue will become an increasingly important contributor to our overall revenue. Because the cost and associated expenses to maintain our software are less than the costs and associated expenses of manufacturing and selling our device, we also anticipate an improvement in our gross margin over time. Additionally, we believe that the recurring nature of subscription revenue should be subject to less period-to-period fluctuation than our product revenue. Because our AI-backed software enables interoperability, mobility, and ease-of-use for scanning, we have been able to execute software-only sales deals with enterprise customers, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. This further reduces fluctuation of our revenue and continues to improve our margin. Finally, as we continue to enhance our product to become the primary platform for point-of-care ultrasound, we expect that add-on features and platform-associated accessories will generate additional revenue at minimal cost, continuing to create margin improvement, while increasing growth.

Our Strategies
 
We believe that our strategies include the following:
 

· | Innovation: Unwavering commitment to leading edge technical innovation. As the first semiconductor-based point-of-care ultrasound, the Butterfly iQ and iQ+ solution is a leading part of the medical imaging revolution. Through leveraging this novel technology, our solution can process and store high quality images that can then be transferred between systems, an interoperability valued by customers in today’s current market. We believe that with our current solution, we have created a new standard for medical imaging and we are focused on remaining on the leading edge of technical innovation. We believe our solution is only the first step in our development and we plan to continually improve this product and expand our product and service offerings. We recently launched the next-generation product Butterfly iQ+ in October 2020, which has improved image quality, durability, and new functionalities such as bi-plane and needle visualization through Needle VizTM technology and 3D scanning. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We plan to develop future applications, subject to appropriate marketing authorization, to leverage our unique hardware foundation and commitment to improving our software using AI. Simultaneously, we plan to enhance our device’s software capabilities, pursuing marketing authorizations as necessary, with new features such as anatomical labeling, image quality improvements, and further workflow automations, in order to more deeply integrate our platform with hospital systems. Additionally, our SDK allows users to create content and applications on our platform that, subject to validation and any necessary marketing authorization, can be deployed across all users, further enhancing our software offerings. In this way, our solution will continue to innovate naturally, as well as through our enhancements to our proprietary technology. In order to pave the way for the potential future at-home use of Butterfly iQ+ and other future form factors, we anticipate we will need to validate the at-home applications through focused clinical trials and also seek additional marketing authorizations.
 
We believe these hardware developments, along with our software enhancements and user education initiatives, will bring ultrasound to new markets and users. We believe that with our differentiated and continually expanding solution, we can drive user adoption in new markets. Beyond these hardware and software product roadmaps, we plan to use the “Butterfly Labs” innovation center to develop new innovative products, services and software applications, leveraging our core technology and platform capabilities.

· | Democratization: Enabling universal adoption of personal medical imaging. We believe the mobility, ease-of-use, affordability, and interoperability of our solution offer a compelling and differentiated alternative to existing devices and have broad applicability across new areas of unmet need. With these differentiating characteristics, our solution not only provides a next generation alternative to legacy cart-based ultrasound systems, but expands the addressable market into a significant amount of new ultrasound scan settings. Our initial customers consist of primary care physicians, emergency doctors, and anesthesiologists, all of whom may have access to a shared ultrasound system, but purchase our product in order to have their own device to carry with them as they practice. Based on their interest and adoption of our solution, we view our global addressable market as 40 million healthcare practitioners, consisting of 12 million medical doctors and 28 million nurses and midwives, significantly greater than the $8 billion traditional ultrasound market. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have only begun to penetrate this healthcare practitioner market and plan to continue to grow this through continually increasing adoption and maintaining high user retention. Initially, we have focused on the approximately three million medical practitioners across anesthesiology, primary care, medical education, emergency medicine, hospital medicine, musculoskeletal treatments, and urology as well as five million nurses in our core geographies. Currently, our device is commercially available in over 20 countries including the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, throughout greater Europe and in parts of Latin America. With such a large addressable market, we believe we can expand successfully over time into geographies across Latin America and Asia, as well as other geographies in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
 
We believe our device’s affordability (all-in hardware and software estimated cost of less than $3 per day over an illustrative 3 year ownership period with Butterfly’s individual user license software subscription), mobility, and ease-of-use, will drive further penetration and adoption in our existing markets and geographies. We believe our roadmap for product enhancements will supplement this penetration as well as provide avenues for expansion to new markets. One of our largest growth opportunities is the potential expansion into remote patient monitoring and products designed for use in the home, subject to appropriate marketing authorizations. This potential market contains more than 100 million patients with chronic diseases in the United States alone, including more than 25 million patients in the United States with urinary incontinence, more than 5 million patients in the United States with congestive heart failure, and approximately 500,000 patients in the United States in need of regular dialysis. We believe that, subject to appropriate marketing authorization, this technology could enable patient-driven scanning for monitoring of chronic disease. We believe our application-based platform allows for even further personalization to improve health outcomes over time. Eventually, as these applications are deployed across the whole user base, we believe this would create a cycle, leading to more product enhancement and drawing in more users. Ultimately, we strive to create a solution that will be the primary operating system for all ultrasound scanning.
 
We believe that through the penetration of the existing addressable market, and the potential subsequent expansion into new markets and geographies that currently do not use medical imaging technology, we can bring the adoption of medical imaging to greater scale than ever achieved before.
 

· | Creating value socially, clinically, and economically. Our mission is to democratize healthcare through providing access to medical imaging at an affordable cost. Because the Butterfly iQ+ is mobile and easy-to-use, healthcare practitioners can expand their use of ultrasound outside of traditional settings, increasing convenience for both practitioners and patients. Additionally, frequent and easier access to scanning has the potential to allow practitioners to detect malignancies earlier and thereby, recommend earlier medical intervention. This could improve health outcomes, while avoiding expensive treatments, generating economic value for both the patient and payor, which is aligned with the healthcare mega-trend of value-based care. As our device reaches new markets and new users and, with appropriate marketing authorizations, enables more direct interaction with patients, including remote patient monitoring, we believe this trend will accelerate, further improving outcomes and reducing costs. This reduction of costs has the potential to create economic value for the whole healthcare system across all clinical applications and markets where ultrasound scanning is used. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition to social impact, we believe our solution will also have significant clinical impact. Through our software solution, empowered by AI, users can upload scanned images to our HIPAA-compliant cloud, which has unlimited storage, links to hospital and office systems, and can be accessed from a desktop computer. This allows practitioners to access and transfer their scanned images in a seamless and secure way, leading to additional opportunities for observation and therefore, we believe, earlier diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, our solution delivers billing codes directly in the user interface application following scanning, both enhancing practitioner compliance adherence and increasing revenue in fee-for-scan environments. In these ways, we believe the technology behind our solution and the data that it is able to gather can provide new and meaningful clinical insights.
 
Beyond optimizing care in developed markets, our solution has the potential to expand into markets and geographies that traditionally have restricted access to care, through its mobility, ease-of-use and affordability. By providing an imaging solution that can connect to practitioners remotely and backing this solution with continued clinical investment, we believe our solution can significantly increase access to healthcare, empowering healthcare practitioners to not only help their patients live safer and healthier lives but also provide medical imaging to patients who otherwise would not have access or could not afford it. We plan to reach these markets primarily through non-profits, non-government organizations, or NGOs, and in some cases, military and paramedic channels. We believe the accessibility our solution brings could have a profound social impact on these markets.

· | Obsessed by customer success, deploying differentiated channel go-to-market approaches. Our primary focus is our users’ and customers’ satisfaction, which has yielded a strong net promoter score of 64 (USA). Word of mouth is the number one driver of sales currently. We intend to grow through providing excellent customer service coupled with our differentiated and evolving product offering. We have approximately eight customer service representatives, dedicated to educating healthcare practitioners on the unique features of our solution, and we have also published numerous training videos and tutorials in response to frequently asked questions. We have invested heavily in building out and educating our salesforce and sales support teams, and plan to continue to do so, with the ultimate goal of creating an intuitive and informative customer experience. As we continue to grow, we plan to expand on our educational tools and resources for our customers to guide them in using our products. We believe that we can build a community of users around our solution to share insights, techniques, and new regulatory compliant ways of applying our solution, all of which we believe will continue to drive adoption and retention. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Furthermore, to increase customer accessibility to our device, we sell through multiple channels, including eCommerce; enterprise (direct); and distributor, veterinary and affiliates. With its interoperability, image transfer / storage, and mobility / remote-monitoring capabilities, our solution can integrate and connect with critical healthcare interfaces such as EMR and imaging systems, critical to coordinated delivery of care. This has helped us to build relationships with and make sales to or agreements with most of the top 100 U.S. healthcare systems, leading to many of our large volume enterprise (direct) sales. Additionally, our sales channel and support has strengthened these relationships. These relationships have increased user accessibility to our solution and the breadth of our network.
 
As we continue to simplify enterprise workflow and develop relationships with larger health systems, we have experienced an increase in the proportion of our sales from enterprise sales compared to eCommerce. Because institutions often make decisions to purchase on a system-wide level, enterprise sales typically generate economies of scale with larger volumes and larger numbers of users, while also increasing user retention. The enterprise channel also yields a higher subscription price, which further increases our profitability on devices and subscriptions sold. We are working towards increasingly integrated solutions to maximize our value to large healthcare customers, as well as continuing to improve our sales and support infrastructure. Our ability to connect and govern traditional third party ultrasound systems gives enterprise customers a solution to the governance and workflow challenges that have limited the utilization and billing of point of care imaging devices. Enterprise customers deploying our solution can benefit from a streamlined clinical workflow that reduces the exam documentation burden typically associated with traditional ultrasound systems. By adopting Butterfly Enterprise software, customers can responsibly manage and optimize value from their fleets of point of care imaging devices.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2020, Legacy Butterfly’s device sales generated approximately 82.9% of its revenue, with its subscription revenue comprising the remaining 17.1%. As adoption of our devices increases through further penetration and healthcare practitioners in the Butterfly network continue to use our devices, we expect our revenue mix to shift toward subscriptions. Because the cost and associated expenses to maintain our software are less than the costs and associated expenses of manufacturing and selling our device, we anticipate an improvement in margin over time.
 

· | Talent inspired and unified by mission. With over approximately 140 years of collective experience in healthcare and consumer end-markets among our executive officers and senior management, our management team is unified by our mission to democratize healthcare by making medical imaging accessible globally.

We are also supported by long-term investors that share this commitment to our mission. Longview’s Sponsor, an affiliate of Glenview, brings to the Company extensive public market experience in the healthcare industry with a long-term orientation across provider, payor, distributor and medical product companies. Our long-term investors include Baillie Gifford, The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Fosun Industrial Co., Limited, and other investors that have invested in us to promote and enable our vision.
 
Finally, to enact our vision, we have developed strong relationships with healthcare institutions as we have sold to or have agreements with most of the top 100 United States health systems. We believe these institutions and our relationships with them are key elements that underpin our ability to achieve our mission. Together with these institutions, we have the potential to bring our imaging solution to millions of patients, reducing healthcare costs and improve outcomes on an enormous scale.
 
Industry & Market Opportunity
 
Medical imaging has existed for over 100 years with the purpose of effectively diagnosing and treating patients. The global ultrasound market has historically consisted of the legacy cart-based incumbents and more recently developed point-of-care / handheld devices. Built using expensive piezoelectric crystal technology, these legacy systems limit wider access and usage due to high upfront costs. Legacy cart-based incumbent devices that are used in traditional hospital systems have a mid-range price point of $45,000 to $60,000 per new system, in addition to burdensome maintenance or service contracts. These devices are often siloed within hospitals and health systems requiring referrals and coordination between different departments, and extensive training for the personnel that operate them, limiting utilization of these devices. Limited IT integration and interoperability capabilities have resulted in image archives that are difficult to move between systems, presenting yet another barrier to care coordination and optimization. The point-of-care / handheld competitors are less expensive than legacy cart-based systems, with price points ranging from $5,000 to $7,000 per probe, generally requiring two to three probes to cover a comparable range of cleared indications to the single probe Butterfly iQ+. Historically, these competitive point-of-care / handheld competitors lack the AI capabilities that the Butterfly iQ+ provides healthcare practitioners and are less core focal points of large capital equipment focused sales forces, which creates a unique opportunity for us to not only disrupt and take market share in the existing market, but create and be the leader in new markets.
 
Between these legacy cart-based incumbent devices and the point-of-care / handheld competitors, the global ultrasound market in 2017 was valued at approximately $8 billion, consisting of $6 billion in equipment and $2 billion in services. This market is currently limited to traditional scan settings in developed markets, such as hospitals, niche doctor offices, and imaging centers. Per IHI Markit data, less than 3% of global ultrasound units are handheld devices. General Electric, Phillips, Canon Medical Systems (f/k/a Toshiba), Hitachi and Siemens Healthineers are the top five incumbent ultrasound players.
 

Through development of our proprietary technology, we were the first company to successfully put ultrasound on a semiconductor chip and connect it to an iPhone, tablet or Android for ease-of-use. This has allowed us to create a solution that has the potential to disrupt the current ultrasound market and significantly expand the total addressable market beyond its current limitations. Butterfly iQ+ takes a small form factor, allowing the user to transport the device anywhere. Butterfly iQ+’s price through our eCommerce website is $1,999 per device and when factoring in an illustrative single-user software subscription license over a three year period is estimated to be less than $3 per day, which enables a material return on investment for healthcare practitioners given common pre-existing CPT codes ranging from $20-150. Finally, our software harnesses AI designed to drive ease-of-use for image acquisition, improve analysis, guide and educate healthcare practitioners, and provide quality control. The Butterfly iQ is designed to be intuitive and greatly reduces the amount of training needed for operation, thereby expanding the ultrasound user base to non-experts, and eventually to patients directly, subject to clearance of at-home uses by the appropriate regulatory authorities. We believe the mobility, affordability, and ease-of-use characteristics of the device will empower users to operate the Butterfly iQ device outside traditional scan settings, such as pre-hospital environments, urgent care clinics, long-term care and rehabilitation centers, dialysis centers, ambulatory surgery centers, veterinary clinics, and potentially, the home, all in both developed and emerging markets. We believe that the Butterfly iQ can greatly increase accessibility to medical imaging and enable the development of new ultrasound markets with expanded users (practitioners and patients) and scan settings globally that are uncommon or nonexistent today.

By increasing accessibility to medical technology outside of traditional settings, the Butterfly iQ has the potential to significantly expand the current total addressable market for medical imaging. We believe there is strong interest from healthcare practitioners to utilize handheld ultrasound devices in their day-to-day work, as primary care practitioners represent our largest group of users. We believe the Butterfly iQ device has the potential to reach up to 40 million global healthcare practitioners, across both developed and emerging markets. Of the approximately 40 million global healthcare practitioners, we view a subset of approximately eight million as our initial target market, which is comprised of approximately three million medical doctors across anesthesiology, primary care, medical education, emergency medicine, hospital medicine, musculoskeletal, and urology, as well as approximately five million nurses, defined as one-third of the nurses and midwives, all within our core geographies of North America, Asia, Europe and Latin America. Beyond this initial market, we believe there are approximately nine million additional medical doctors (12 million total) and approximately 23 million additional nurses and midwives (approximately 28 million total) that would benefit from use of handheld ultrasound devices.
 
Furthermore, as patient-focused, value-based care delivery models continue to scale, we believe handheld ultrasound devices will find a potential market with at-home medical personnel and, subject to appropriate marketing authorizations, with patients directly.
 


Products & Services
 
We provide a complete solution to address an unmet need in point-of-care medical imaging through a unique combination of hardware and software services. Our hardware is powered by the first and only currently available ultrasound on a semiconductor chip. Our software addresses the traditional ease-of-use challenges and the complex clinical workflow throughout a patient’s care pre-and post-examination. Our integrated system with EMRs provides healthcare practitioners with a tool that enables fast and confident clinical decision-making.

As a diagnostic tool with broad applicability across numerous medical specialties, Butterfly iQ+ has the potential to serve as the go-to device for healthcare practitioners in determining approaches to treatment. We believe there is strong applicability for ultrasound devices across anesthesiology, primary care, medical education, emergency medicine, hospital medicine, musculoskeletal, and urology. Historically, technology and excessive costs have limited the use of ultrasound devices. As new technology has catalyzed the mobility and ubiquity of medical imaging, the range of uses for ultrasound devices has greatly expanded. This momentum is supported by clinical evidence that shows that use of ultrasound devices in this modality can improve patient health outcomes, while significantly lowering the cost of care. The high cost of ultrasound imaging has deterred some medical professionals from utilizing these devices to prevent the unnecessary costs on providers or patients. However, the Butterfly iQ device offers providers the use of these images at a low cost that may promote early detection of patient malignancies that, in turn, reduces costs for providers and reduces the need for external imaging, specialist referrals, and emergency room visits. High-risk patients who suffer from congestive heart failure and pulmonary diseases will be able to receive regular ultrasound imaging at a low cost, which is associated with reduced emergency visits and overall patient costs.
 
Our Ultrasound-on-Chip™ technology enables whole-body complete ultrasound imaging with a single probe, as the Butterfly iQ and iQ+ have a frequency range that enables our device to produce ultrasound imaging anywhere on the body. Our solution is the only ultrasound transducer that can perform whole-body imaging in a single handheld probe using semiconductor technology. In addition, the 60 year-old piezoelectric crystal technology used in existing devices has been less affordable and has not been able to achieve the same versatility or system interoperability. Because our device is portable, practitioners can easily carry this device with them, providing access to ultrasound virtually anywhere. While currently our device is used in traditional scan settings, such as hospitals, imaging centers, and physicians’ offices, we believe our device’s mobility will enable expansion to pre-hospital settings, urgent care clinics, long-term care and rehabilitation centers, dialysis centers, ambulatory surgery centers, veterinary clinics, and, subject to marketing authorization, homes.
 
We currently sell the Butterfly iQ+ device through our eCommerce website, with an optional accompanying software membership at various prices depending on the type of subscription. We offer a Pro subscription with one user license included, a Pro Team subscription with five user licenses included, and an enterprise subscription with tiered level pricing. We also sell accessories that supplement our device, including a carrying case, charger (complimentary with the purchase of the device), holster, and cable accessories. Legacy Butterfly has been selling the first generation Butterfly iQ since 2018 and launched the second generation Butterfly iQ+ in October 2020.

Our Butterfly iQ+ device connects directly to an iPhone or Android smartphone and tablet to provide its imaging and software features for more than two consecutive hours and charges to full battery in approximately five hours. Our proprietary software harnesses AI designed to drive ease-of-use for image acquisition and improved analysis, further used to guide and educate practitioners, as well as provide quality control. The Butterfly iQ+ has 20 pre-set settings generated in part with AI that optimize images obtained from scanning different areas of the body. Within the Butterfly application, users can utilize five imaging modes, including B-Mode, Color Doppler, M-Mode Power Doppler and Pulsed Wave Doppler, as well as additional measuring tools and obstetrician calculations. These features allow healthcare practitioners to perform surface area and volume measurements on the anatomical objects that are imaged and can use color Doppler to identify movement of fluid, similar to features provided by legacy products in the market. For the obstetric clinicians, the device tools can perform gestational age and amniotic fluid index calculations. We believe these pre-set settings and intuitive operation features through smartphones will enable healthcare practitioners who are not medical imaging experts to adopt our device, expanding our user base beyond the traditional, limited ultrasound user base. This traditional base of ultrasound users has been limited because existing ultrasound devices often require unique environments and extensive training to operate, while the Butterfly iQ+ device can be used by general and other healthcare practitioners across the healthcare industry.

Through our software subscription options, users can upload scanned images to our HIPAA-compliant cloud, which has unlimited storage and links to hospital and office systems, allowing for seamless transfer of images that can also be accessed from a desktop computer. As telemedicine continues to make headway through our healthcare system, our software application features TeleGuidance, which is the world’s first integrated ultrasound telemedicine platform. This tool, if eventually approved, would allow a remote, trained healthcare practitioner to view the ultrasound imaging through the smartphone application and live video. Our platform also features education tools to enable users to quickly gain proficiency in conducting exams. As we continue to expand on these features, our software updates are implemented real-time, equipping users with new features and techniques with each update.

Our Butterfly iQ+ device is competitively priced at $1,999 per device through our eCommerce website, and combined with our standard single-user software license, the total estimated cost of use amounts to a daily average of less than $3, assuming an illustrative three year ownership period. This compares to the cost of $5,000 to $7,000 per device for point-of-care / handheld competitors, generally requiring two to three probes to cover a comparable range of cleared indications to the single probe Butterfly iQ+, and pricing of legacy cart-based incumbents, which are $5,000 to $30,000 per new device on the low end and can be as much as $100,000 to $250,000 per new device on the high end, before service and maintenance fees. Additionally, the Butterfly iQ+ device’s remote capabilities, interoperability with other systems, ease-of-use, and affordability allow trained practitioners to perform ultrasounds from any location where healthcare is provided and we believe will eventually increase the user base to consumers and non-experts should the appropriate marketing authorizations be obtained for such intended uses, in accordance with our mission to democratize healthcare by increasing accessibility to medical imaging. We believe this user base expansion and subsequent adoption is our largest growth driver and represents the forefront of a medical imaging revolution.
 


Furthermore, we believe our device’s ability to perform ultrasound outside of traditional environments and by non-expert users will allow for prevention and earlier detection and enable healthcare practitioners outside of traditional environments to use ultrasound to make more precise diagnosis of malignancies. This provides patients with faster access to treatment, ultimately reducing cost and improving patient health outcomes. The reduced cost will also result from lower-cost medical professionals performing diagnosis, enabled by the device’s intuitive user interface. We believe our device is also more convenient for patients, as the device can be brought to the patient at the bedside (or, subject to future marketing authorizations, to their home), thereby reducing or eliminating patient wait times while providing secure patient image access. With our device’s differentiating characteristics, we believe our business is aligned with long-term healthcare mega-trends, most notably the acceleration of value-based and patient-centric approach to care.
 
We believe that the software and analytics capabilities of our solution coupled with the next generation Butterfly iQ+ device empowers smarter and expanded scanning and compliant coding and documentation that can generate both incremental revenue for healthcare systems and independent practitioners, but also reduce costs for payers from earlier detection and prevention of adverse downstream events due to suboptimal care decisions or treatment complications. The Butterfly iQ+ leverages pre-existing, routine CPT codes that enable healthcare providers and practitioners to obtain per-scan reimbursement in the specialties of anesthesiology, cardiology, critical care, emergency medicine, endocrinology and ultrasound-guided procedures. We intend to pursue incremental, new or expansionary CPT codes for reimbursement in future scan categories and categories concurrent to support the successful go-to-market strategy of the product pipeline.
 
Product Roadmap
 
Our product roadmap will continue to position us as a leading disruptor in the medical imaging market and remote patient monitoring market, which we believes consists of over 100 million patients in the United States alone. As the first semi-conductor based point-of-care ultrasound, the original Butterfly iQ product launched in 2018 was a differentiated product. We plan to continually improve this product, which will allow us to continue to innovate up the performance curve. A first step to this was the launch of the next-generation product Butterfly iQ+ in 2020, which has improved image quality, industry-leading durability, and new functionalities such as bi-plane needle visualization through Needle VizTM technology and 3D scanning.
 
We expect to continue development of the hardware with product offerings that may include enhanced performance, improved image quality and alternative form factors. 
 
18

 

In addition to our hardware innovations, we employ a team of computer scientists focused on developing software features that enhance our device’s user interface and increase ease-of-use to continue to expand our user base. Through our intuitive features and continued user education initiatives, we expect to generate high adoption rates among healthcare practitioners and further expand our user base into the patient’s home subject to obtaining the appropriate marketing authorizations. Furthermore, we believe our SDK will continue to drive additional enhancements generated by our user base, simultaneously increasing the applicability of our solution and driving adoption and retention in our addressable market.
 
Beyond these hardware and software product roadmaps, we plan to develop new innovative products, services and software applications, leveraging the company’s core technology and platform capabilities. Through this product development, we believe we will be positioned to remain on the forefront of medical imaging with a continued focus on increasing accessibility, allowing us to fulfill our mission of democratizing healthcare by making medical imaging available to everyone around the world.
 
Our People
 
Our mission is to democratize healthcare and to make medical imaging accessible to everyone around the world by using our proprietary technology.
 
We believe that our people are the reason for our success and we have organized ourselves to maximize productivity and performance. We maintain a high bar for talent and actively work to build diversity within our workforce.
 
As of March 1, 2021, we had 260 employees, including 260 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Marketing and Brand Building
 
Our marketing efforts are focused on developing a strong reputation with healthcare providers and increasing awareness of our products and services. In addition to print and digital advertising, positive feedback about the Butterfly iQ+ among practitioners has historically been a significant driver of sales, as healthcare practitioners share their appreciation for the Butterfly iQ and Butterfly iQ+ within their medical communities, yielding a strong net promoter score of 64 (USA) as of March 1, 2021. We have conducted customer outreach and marketing through articles and other media coverage about our products. We market our products through our targeted sales organization, which is engaged in sales efforts and promotional activities primarily to health systems or institutions. Outside of the United States, we market our products directly to healthcare institutions and through eCommerce. In the United States, we sell to or have agreements in place with most of the largest 100 U.S. healthcare systems.
 
We use a variety of marketing tools to drive adoption, ensure continued usage and establish brand loyalty for our devices and software. We recognize the importance of the role of education in accelerating adoption of our products by those medical professionals without existing ultrasound skills. To that end, we have hired a renowned point-of-care ultrasound, or POCUS, educator to lead team expansion and offerings to include didactic, synchronous and asynchronous coaching, quality as a service and a formal learning management system to track clinicians’ progress. In addition to creating awareness of the benefits of our hand-held ultrasound device and the advantages of our technology for healthcare providers and patients, we engage customer service representatives who are dedicated to educating practitioners on the unique features of our device and software and who have published numerous training videos and tutorials in response to frequently asked questions.

Sales
 
The Butterfly iQ+ is commercially available in over 20 countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, throughout greater Europe and in parts of Latin America. We believe the Butterfly iQ device has the potential to reach up to 40 million global healthcare practitioners, across both developed and emerging markets. Of the approximately 40 million global healthcare practitioners, we view a subset of approximately eight million as our initial target market, which is comprised of approximately three million medical doctors across anesthesiology, primary care, medical education, emergency medicine, hospital medicine, musculoskeletal, and urology, as well as approximately five million nurses, defined as one-third of the nurses and midwives, all within our core geographies of North America, Asia, Europe and Latin America. Beyond this initial market, we believe there are approximately nine million additional medical doctors (12 million total) and approximately 23 million additional nurses and midwives (approximately 28 million total) that would benefit from use of handheld ultrasound devices. We believe the mobility, affordability, and ease-of-use characteristics of the device will empower users to operate the Butterfly iQ device outside traditional scan settings, such as pre-hospital environments, urgent care clinics, long-term care and rehabilitation centers, dialysis centers, ambulatory surgery centers, veterinary clinics, and subject to future marketing authorizations, the home, all in both developed and emerging markets.
 
One of our largest growth opportunities is the potential expansion into remote patient monitoring with wearable products and products designed for use in the home, subject to obtaining appropriate marketing authorizations. This potential market contains more than 100 million patients with chronic diseases in the United States alone, including more than 25 million patients in the United States with urinary incontinence, more than 5 million patients in the United States with congestive heart failure, and approximately 500,000 patients in the United States in need of regular dialysis.
 
Butterfly iQ+ is commercially available in over 20 countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, throughout greater Europe and in parts of Latin America. Butterfly’s commercialization strategy is predicated on three primary channels:
 

· | an eCommerce website through which we sell the Butterfly iQ+ to healthcare practitioners in these geographies; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a targeted enterprise sales force focused on direct, large-volume sales to large healthcare system-wide implementations in the United States and in select markets; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | distributors, veterinary and affiliates to unlock additional channels to supplement our direct and eCommerce sales. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our eCommerce channel is focused on building awareness of our brand, attracting qualified traffic to our website and converting healthcare practitioners who visit the website to customers that purchase our products. The sales cycle through our eCommerce channel is short and simple, where a potential user’s positive purchase intent is followed immediately by a purchase. For sales to individuals, our eCommerce channel replaces the need for a sales force. By contrast, our large-volume enterprise sales reflect a complex, multi-step sales cycle involving many parties and components, including sales and integration support and customer service personnel. Sales through distributors entails our development of relationships with parties to whom we can delegate our sales in our target markets.
 
As we continue to simplify enterprise workflow and develop relationships with larger health systems, we have experienced an increase in the proportion of our sales from enterprise sales compared to eCommerce. Because institutions often make decisions to purchase on a system-wide level, enterprise sales typically generate economies of scale with larger volumes and larger numbers of users, while also increasing user retention. The enterprise channel also yields a higher subscription price, which further increases our profitability on devices and subscriptions sold. We are working to continually shift volumes to the enterprise channel with the aim of ultimately using this as our primary channel, which may require increases in our sales force.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2020, Legacy Butterfly’s device sales generated approximately 82.9% of its revenue, with its subscription revenue comprising the remaining 17.1%. As adoption of our devices increases through further penetration and healthcare practitioners in the Butterfly network continue to use our devices, we expect our revenue mix to shift toward subscriptions. Because the cost and associated expenses to maintain our software are less than the costs and associated expenses of manufacturing and selling our device, we anticipate an improvement in margin over time.
 
20

 

In terms of geographic markets, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, a substantial majority of Legacy Butterfly’s revenues were derived from sales to customers based in the United States (87% in the year ended December 31, 2020). We aim to further expand our international customer base in the future. We believe our differentiated Butterfly iQ handheld device and our growing user base of Butterfly iQ practitioners, with sales to or agreements with most of the top 100 U.S. healthcare systems and across more than 40 countries, position us well to compete in the existing ultrasound market and to potentially expand into emerging markets.
 
We continue to develop our sales and marketing organization, which consists of a dedicated sales team complemented by a marketing team as well as sales and marketing support personnel. Our sales force (including marketing, sales and sales and marketing support personnel) as of December 31, 2020, consisted of 51 persons, 46 of whom were located in the United States and five of whom were located in Europe and Australia.
 
Manufacturing
 
Our Butterfly iQ products are built using both custom-made and off-the-shelf components supplied by outside manufacturers and vendors located in China, Taiwan and Thailand. One key custom-made component in the Butterfly IQ probe is the transducer module for the printed circuit board of the chip. The majority of the other components for the Butterfly iQ probe are off-the-shelf.
 
We purchase some of our components and materials used in manufacturing, including the transducer module, from single sources. Although we believe that alternatives would be available, it would take time to identify and validate replacement components, which could negatively affect our ability to supply our products on a timely basis. We cannot give assurances that any alternative supplier would be able to recreate the manufacturing processes currently in use. To mitigate this risk, we typically carry a significant inventory of critical components.
 
All of our iQ probes are manufactured, tested, shipped and supported by Benchmark Electronics, Inc., or Benchmark, from its facilities in Thailand. We believe that this manufacturing strategy is efficient and conserves capital. However, in the event it becomes necessary to utilize a different contract manufacturer for our iQ products, we would experience additional costs, delays and difficulties in doing so, and our business could be harmed.
 
Key Agreements
 
Foundry Service Agreement with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited
 
We entered into a Foundry Service Agreement, or FSA, with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, or TSMC, as amended, under which TSMC agreed to manufacture integrated circuits used for the semiconductor chips in our probes.

We have entered into exclusive and non-exclusive licenses in the ordinary course of business relating to our technologies or other intellectual property rights or assets.
 
Exclusive (Equity) Agreement with Leland Stanford Junior University
 
In June 2013, we entered into an Exclusive (Equity) Agreement, or the Stanford Agreement, with the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University, or Stanford. Pursuant to the Stanford Agreement, Stanford granted us a co-exclusive, worldwide license to make, have made, use, import, offer to sell and sell products covered by patent rights to Stanford’s wafer bonding technology. The rights licensed tous are for ultrasound applications using the wafer bonding technology excluding certain applications, and the license remains exclusive, except for certain non-exclusive applications, until the earlier of December 23, 2023 or the seventh anniversary of the first sale of any product using the licensed technology, and thereafter will be nonexclusive until the last licensed patent expires. The last licensed patent is currently expected to expire in 2030. The rights licensed to us, except for the non-exclusive applications, are sublicensable during such exclusive term, subject to our continued development or sale of the products using the technology licensed under the agreement and, following the exclusive term, subject to Stanford’s prior approval. The Stanford Agreement outlines certain milestones to be met by us in connection with the development and sales of these products.
 
Under the terms of the Stanford Agreement, we paid a one-time, non-refundable upfront royalty fee. We are required to pay Stanford low single-digit royalties on all net sales of products that use the licensed technology, as well as a portion of any sublicensing revenues, during the term of the Stanford Agreement and if certain products using the licensed technology are made, used, imported, or offered for sale before the date the Stanford Agreement terminates, and those products are sold after the termination date, we will pay Stanford an earned royalty for our exercise of rights based on the net sales of those products. We are also obligated to pay Stanford annual license maintenance fees, which are fully creditable against any royalty payments made by us for such year. We are also required to provide Stanford with periodic reports documenting our progress toward the development and commercialization of products using the licensed technology. Stanford is responsible under the agreement for preparing, filing and prosecuting patent claims and for maintaining the patents pertaining to the licensed technology.
 
Stanford may terminate the agreement in the event that we are materially delinquent on any payment, fail to diligently develop and commercialize a product incorporating the licensed technology, materially miss a milestone under the agreement, are in material breach of any substantive provision under the agreement, or knowingly provide any false report or are materially delinquent on any report, in each case which is not remedied within cure period. In addition, if we are not diligently developing and commercializing such a product incorporating the licensed technology, materially miss a milestone or knowingly provide a false report or are delinquent on any report, and we do not cure, the agreement shall not terminate, but it remains subject to termination by Stanford and the license shall convert to a non-exclusive license. We may terminate the agreement at any time upon at least 30 days’ prior written notice. Upon termination of the agreement, all rights to the licensed technology revert to Stanford. Legacy Butterfly’s obligation to pay royalties accrued or accruable survives any termination or expiration of the agreement.
 
Government Regulation
 
The diagnostic medical devices that we manufacture and distribute are subject to regulation by numerous regulatory bodies, including the FDA and comparable international regulatory agencies. These agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, marketing and distribution of medical devices. Devices are generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control, the most comprehensive of which requires that a clinical evaluation program be conducted before a device can be approved for marketing and commercial distribution. In addition, healthcare regulatory bodies in the United States and around the world impose a range of requirements related to paying for medical devices and the procedures in which they are used, including laws intended to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse of healthcare dollars.

U.S. Laws and Regulations
 
At the federal level, our diagnostic ultrasound products and certain accessories are medical devices subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA. Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, referred to as the FDCA, and its implementing regulations, the FDA regulates product design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, pre-market clearance, authorization or approval, establishment registration and product listing, product manufacturing, product packaging and labeling, product storage, advertising and promotion, product distribution, recalls and field actions, servicing and post-market clinical surveillance. Some of our products are also subject to the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act, administered by the FDA, which imposes performance standards and record keeping, reporting, product testing and product labeling requirements for electronic products that emit radiation, such as x-rays, although diagnostic ultrasound products like ours are subject only to a limited portion of those requirements. A number of U.S. states also impose licensing and compliance regimes on companies that manufacture or distribute prescription devices into or within the state.
 
In addition, the commercialization and use of our devices in the United States is subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, and state agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of payment for health care items and services. Federal laws and regulations apply primarily in connection with government payer programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, but state laws apply more broadly, encompassing health care items and services covered by private payers. At the state and federal level, the government’s interest is in regulating the quality and cost of health care and protecting the independent clinical judgment of licensed healthcare providers.
 
The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, also regulate the advertising and promotion of our products to ensure that any claims made in commerce are consistent with the products’ regulatory clearances, that there is scientific data to substantiate the claims being made, that the advertising is neither false nor misleading, and that patient or physician testimonials or endorsements we or our agents disseminate comply with disclosure and other regulatory requirements. In general, medical device manufacturers and distributors may not promote or advertise their products for uses not within the scope of a given product’s intended use(s), make unsupported safety and effectiveness claims, or use third parties to make claims about the product that the manufacturer/distributor could not lawfully make itself.
 
FDA Regulation of Medical Devices
 
The FDA classifies medical devices into three classes based on risk. Regulatory control increases from Class I (lowest risk) to Class III (highest risk). The FDA generally must clear or approve the commercial sale of most new medical devices that fall within product categories designated as Class II and III. Commercial sales of Class II (except for Class II devices exempt from pre-market notification requirements) and Class III medical devices within the United States must be preceded either by a pre-market notification and clearance pursuant to Section 510(k) of the FDCA (Class II) or by the granting of a pre-market approval, or PMA, (Class III), after a pre-market application is submitted. Both 510(k) notifications and PMA applications must be submitted to FDA with user fees (over $12,000 for a 510(k) and $365,000 for a PMA in FY 2021), although reduced fees for small businesses are available. Class I devices are generally exempt from pre-market review and notification, as are some moderate-risk Class II devices. All classes of devices must comply with FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, establishment registration, medical device listing, labeling requirements, and medical device reporting, or MDR, regulations, which are collectively referred to as device general controls. Class II devices may also be subject to special controls such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, FDA guidelines or particularized labeling. Some Class I and Class II devices can be exempted by regulation from the requirement of compliance with substantially all of the QSR.
 
A 510(k) pre-market notification must contain information sufficient to demonstrate that the new device is substantially equivalent to a device commercially distributed prior to May 28, 1976 or to a device that has been determined by the FDA to be substantially equivalent to such a so-called “pre-amendments” device. To obtain 510(k) clearance for a non-exempt Class II device, we must submit a pre-market notification to the FDA demonstrating that our product is substantially equivalent to such a predicate device. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process generally takes from three to 12 months from the date the application is submitted, but it may take longer if the FDA has significant questions or needs more information about the new device or its manufacturing or quality controls.
 
As part of the 510(k) notification process for Class II devices like our iQ system, which has an existing classification regulation available for purposes of the regulatory filing, the FDA may require the following:
 

· | Comprehensive product description and indications for use. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Extensive pre-clinical tests and/or pre-clinical animal studies, performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations, as well as any performance standards or other testing requirements established by FDA through regulations or device-specific guidance. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
24

 


· | Comprehensive review of predicate devices and development of data supporting the new product’s substantial equivalence to one or more predicate devices. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Assuming successful completion of all required testing, a detailed 510(k) notification is submitted to the FDA requesting clearance to market the product. This pre-market notification includes all relevant data from pertinent pre-clinical and clinical trials (if applicable), together with detailed information relating to the product’s manufacturing controls and proposed labeling, and other relevant documentation. The FDA evaluates all 510(k) submissions prior to filing for full review based on specific acceptance criteria and may issue a refuse-to-accept notification if the submission is deficient with respect to any of the established criteria. If the FDA determines that the applicant’s device is substantially equivalent to the identified predicate device(s), the agency will issue a 510(k) clearance letter that authorizes commercial marketing of the device for one or more specific indications for use. If the FDA determines that the applicant’s device is not substantially equivalent to the predicate device(s), the agency will issue a not-substantially-equivalent letter stating that the new device may not be commercially distributed.
 
After a new medical device receives FDA 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require the submission of a PMA. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make the determination of whether a device modification requires a new 510(k) notification or PMA in the first instance, but the FDA may review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s decision not to seek a new 510(k) clearance or PMA for a particular change, the FDA may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance or PMA. The FDA may also require the manufacturer to cease U.S. marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval for the modification is obtained.
 
If a previously unclassified new medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) pre-market notification process because no predicate device to which it is substantially equivalent can be identified, the device is automatically classified into Class III. However, if such a device would be considered low or moderate risk (in other words, it does not rise to the level of requiring the approval of a PMA), it may be eligible for the De Novo classification process. The De Novo classification process allows a device developer to request that the novel medical device be able to obtain marketing authorization as either a Class I or Class II device, rather than having it regulated as a high-risk Class III device subject to the PMA requirements. In December 2018, the FDA issued a Proposed Rule that would formally codify requirements for the medical device De Novo process and the procedures and criteria for product developers to file a De Novo classification request. Although this rule was expected to be finalized during the second half of 2020, it remains pending at FDA and the rulemaking process may be subject to additional activity after the COVID-19 pandemic abates and pressure on the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, or CDRH, is reduced. Over the past 20 years, the De Novo process has been implemented by the FDA pursuant to statutory authorities and through informal guidance and iterative changes by Congress. The Proposed Rule allowed industry stakeholders to participate in the development of the FDA’s policies and procedures for De Novo requests through the notice-and-comment rulemaking process. Although the Proposed Rule, if finalized by the FDA, would not impact our marketed products and is not expected to impact our products in current development, the FDA’s activities are aimed at creating predictability, consistency and transparency for innovative medical device developers.
 
As an alternative to the De Novo classification process, a company that develops or manufactures a novel device could also file a reclassification petition seeking to change the automatic Class III designation of the novel post-amendment device under Section 513(f)(3) of the FDCA. The FDA can also initiate reclassification of an existing device type on its own initiative. In December 2018, the FDA issued a final rule to clarify the administrative process through which the FDA reclassifies a medical device. To reclassify a device under section 513(e) of the FDCA, the FDA must first publish a proposed reclassification order that includes a summary of the valid scientific evidence that supports the reclassification; convene a device classification panel meeting; and consider comments to the public docket before it then publishes a final reclassification order in the Federal Register.
 
Our iQ and iQ+ probes have been classified and are regulated as Class II devices, although future products we develop may be classified as Class III devices and may require a PMA. A PMA application must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, pre-clinical, clinical, manufacturing and labeling data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device for its intended use(s). A PMA application also must include a complete description of the device and its components, a detailed description of the methods, facilities and controls used to manufacture the device, and proposed labeling. After a PMA application is submitted and found to be sufficiently complete, it is considered “filed” and the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information. During this substantive review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA. In addition, the FDA generally will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility to evaluate compliance with the QSR, which requires manufacturers to implement and follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures.
 
25

 

FDA review of a PMA application is required to be completed within 180 days of the application’s filing date although in some cases approval may take significantly longer. The current user fee agreement between the FDA and the medical device industry sets as a target that PMA reviews be completed in under one year. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:
 

· | the product may not be safe or effective for its intended use(s) to the FDA’s satisfaction; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the data from the applicant’s pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support approval; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the manufacturing process or facilities that the applicant uses may not meet applicable requirements; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | changes in the FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data to demonstrate the safety or effectiveness of the device. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
If an FDA evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facility is favorable, the FDA will generally issue an “approval letter,” which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been met to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of a device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. If the FDA’s evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facility is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a “not approvable letter.” The FDA may also determine that additional trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while such additional trials are conducted and data is submitted in an amendment to the PMA. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy. PMA approval may also be granted with post-approval requirements such as the need for additional patient follow-up for an indefinite period of time.
 
New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for any modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that is approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplements are limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA application and may or may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
 
Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for a 510(k) pre-market notification. In order to conduct a clinical investigation involving human subjects for the purpose of demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of a medical device, a company must, among other things, apply for and obtain institutional review board, or IRB, approval of the proposed investigation. In addition, if the clinical study involves a “significant risk” (as defined by the FDA) to human health, the sponsor of the investigation must also submit and obtain FDA approval of an investigational device exemption, or IDE, application. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of study participants, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for abbreviated IDE requirements. Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by a duly-appointed IRB at each clinical trial site. The FDA’s approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward, but does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product’s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria. All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations, which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion, and specify an array of Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements, which include, among other things, recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. Clinical trials must further comply with the FDA’s regulations for IRB approval and for informed consent and other human subject protections. Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA. The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant approval or clearance of a product.
 
The commencement or completion of any of our clinical trials may be delayed or halted, or may be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application (or clearance of a 510(k) notification, as applicable), for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:
 

· | the FDA, the IRB(s), or other regulatory authorities may not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial, or may place a clinical trial on hold; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | participants may not enroll in clinical trials at the rate we anticipate; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
26

 


· | participants may not comply with trial protocols; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | participant follow-up may not occur at the rate we anticipate; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | patients may experience adverse side effects; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | participants may die during a clinical trial, even though their death may not be related to the use of our products; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | IRBs and third-party clinical investigators may delay or reject our trial protocol; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | third-party clinical investigators may decline to participate in a trial or may not perform a trial on our anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, GCPs or other FDA requirements; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | we or third-party organizations may not perform data collection, monitoring and analysis in a timely or accurate manner or consistent with the clinical trial protocol or investigational or statistical plans; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | third-party clinical investigators may have significant financial interests related to us or the study that the FDA deems sufficient to make the study results unreliable, or we or investigators fail to disclose such interests; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | any unfavorable regulatory inspections of our clinical trial sites or manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the interim or final results of the clinical trial may be inconclusive or unfavorable as to safety or effectiveness; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the FDA may conclude that the results from our trial and/or trial design are inadequate to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of the product. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In 2017, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for our iQ probe, and the FDA determined, following a 2020 pre-submission meeting with us, that the Butterfly iQ+ was eligible to be marketed under the original 510(k).
 
In addition, our proprietary software and data transfer service allows researchers to control the transfer of data from certain devices to research tools and databases according to their own research workflows. The infrastructure of the data management service is considered a “medical device data system”, or MDDS, and does not require 510(k) clearance. An MDDS is a hardware or software product that transfers, stores, converts, formats, and displays medical device data. An MDDS does not modify the data or modify the display of the data, and it does not by itself control the functions or parameters of any other medical device. An MDDS is not intended to be used for active patient monitoring. Software that meets the definition of an MDDS (such as that comprising our service offering) is excluded from the definition of “device” under the FDCA, and from the regulations applicable to devices, while hardware that meets the definition of an MDDS is generally classified as a low-risk, Class I device product that is exempt from pre-market review and notification.
 
After a device is authorized for marketing and placed in commercial distribution (or, for 510(k)-exempt products, placed into commerce without first obtaining FDA clearance or approval), numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply to the device. All device classes must meet general regulatory controls, including:
 

· | establishment registration and device listing; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, storage, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | labeling regulations, which govern the mandatory elements of the device labels and packaging (including Unique Device Identifier markings for certain categories of products); 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the MDR regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | voluntary and mandatory device recalls to address problems when a device is defective and/or could be a risk to health; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
27

 


· | correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Also, the FDA may require us to conduct post-market surveillance studies or order us to establish and maintain a system for tracking our products through the chain of distribution to the patient level. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including those applicable to the conduct of our clinical trials, can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may lead to any of the following sanctions:
 

· | Warning Letters or Untitled Letters that require corrective action; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | fines and civil penalties;
--+---------------------------


· | unanticipated expenditures;
--+----------------------------


· | delays in approving/clearing or refusal to approve/clear our future products; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export our products for sale in other countries; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | suspension or withdrawal of FDA approval or clearance; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | product recall or seizure; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | interruption of production;
--+----------------------------


· | operating restrictions;
--+------------------------


· | injunctions; and
--+-----------------


· | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

 
We and our contract manufacturers, specification developers, and some suppliers of components or device accessories are also required to manufacture medical device products in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements set forth in the QSR, unless explicitly exempted by regulation. The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components or services, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing, and record keeping. The FDA evaluates compliance with the QSR through periodic and often unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue reports known as Forms FDA 483 or Notices of Inspectional Observations, which list instances where the FDA inspector believes the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures. If the observations are sufficiently serious or the manufacturer fails to respond appropriately, the FDA may issue Warning Letters, which are notices of intended enforcement actions against the manufacturer, or Untitled Letters, which are used for less serious violations that may not rise to the level of regulatory significance, or it may take more significant administrative or legal action. For example, if the FDA believes we or any of our contract manufacturers or regulated suppliers are not in compliance with these requirements and patients are being subjected to serious risks, it can shut down our manufacturing operations, require recalls of our products, refuse to approve new marketing applications, initiate legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations, or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees. Any such action by the FDA would have a material adverse effect on our business. We may be unable to comply with all applicable FDA regulations.
 
U.S. Fraud and Abuse Laws and Other Compliance Requirements
 
Successfully commercializing a medical device or technology depends not only on FDA approval, but also on broad health insurance or third-party payor coverage. Government and private payors institute coverage criteria to ensure the appropriate utilization of products and services and to control costs. Limited third party payor coverage for a technology or procedure may limit adoption and commercial viability, while broader coverage supports optimal market uptake. Favorable coverage decisions by government payors like Medicare or Medicaid are critical because private payors typically follow the government’s lead regarding reimbursement. However, manufacturers whose technology is reimbursed by the government payors are subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse. These laws can be implicated by inappropriate sales and marketing arrangements with healthcare providers. Many commonly accepted commercial practices are illegal in the healthcare industry and violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.
 
28

 

Anti-kickback Laws.   The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging of a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including such items as gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, waiver of payments, and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The Department of Health and Human Services — Office of the Inspector General, has issued regulations, commonly known as safe harbors, which set forth certain provisions that, if satisfied in their entirety, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor element may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities or invite litigation by private citizens under federal whistleblower laws. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broadly interpreted and aggressively enforced, with the result that beneficial commercial arrangements can be criminalized in the health care industry because of the Anti-Kickback Statute.
 
The penalties for violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include imprisonment for up to ten years, fines of up to $100,000 per violation and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Many states have adopted prohibitions similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not only by the government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.
 
Federal False Claims Act.   The federal False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim, or the knowing use of false statements or records to obtain payment from the federal government. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it must pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $11,181 and $22,363 for each separate false claim. Suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as “qui tam” actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals (known as “relators” or, more commonly, “whistleblowers”) may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. In addition, certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act. Qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend a false claim action, even before the validity of the claim is established and even if the government decides not to intervene in the lawsuit. Healthcare companies may decide to agree to large settlements with the government and/or whistleblowers to avoid the cost and negative publicity associated with litigation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act amended federal law to provide that a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Criminal prosecution is possible for knowingly making or presenting a false or fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government.
Federal Physician Self-Referral Law.   The Federal Physician Self-Referral Law, also referred to as the Stark Law, prohibits a physician (or an immediate family member of a physician) who has a financial relationship with an entity from referring patients to that entity for certain designated health services, including durable medical equipment and supplies, payable by Medicare, unless an exception applies. The Stark Law also prohibits such an entity from presenting or causing to be presented a claim to the Medicare program for such designated health services provided pursuant to a prohibited referral, and provides that certain collections related to any such claims must be refunded in a timely manner. Exceptions to the Stark Law include, among other things, exceptions for certain financial relationships, including both ownership and compensation arrangements. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute: to the extent that the statute is implicated and an exception does not apply, the statute is violated. In addition to the Stark Law, many states have implemented similar physician self-referral prohibitions that may extend to Medicaid, third party payors, and self-pay patients. Violations of the Stark Law must be reported and unauthorized claims must be refunded to Medicare in order to avoid potential liability under the federal False Claims Act for avoiding a known obligation to return identified overpayments. Violations of the Stark Law, the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law and/or the federal False Claims Act can also form the basis for exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs.
Civil Monetary Penalties Law.   The Civil Monetary Penalties Law, or CMPL, authorizes the imposition of substantial civil money penalties against an entity that engages in certain prohibited activities including but not limited to violations of the Stark Law or Anti-Kickback Statute, knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim, employment of an excluded individual, and the provision or offer of anything of value to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the transferring party knows or should know is likely to influence beneficiary selection of a particular provider for which payment may be made in whole or part by a federal health care program, commonly known as the Beneficiary Inducement CMP. Remuneration is defined under the CMPL as any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value. There are certain exceptions to the definition of remuneration for offerings that meet the Financial Need, Preventative Care, or Promoting Access to Care exceptions (as defined in the CMPL). Sanctions for violations of the CMPL include civil monetary penalties and administrative penalties up to and including exclusion from participation in federal health care programs.

State Analogs of Federal Fraud and Abuse Laws.   Many U.S. states have their own laws intended to protect against fraud and abuse in the health care industry and more broadly. In some cases these laws prohibit or regulate additional conduct beyond what federal law affects. Penalties for violating these laws can range from fines to criminal sanctions.
 
HIPAA and Other Privacy Laws and Regulations.   The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and implementing regulations, or HIPAA, created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 
HIPAA, as well as a number of other federal and state privacy-related laws, extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, known as “protected health information”, or PHI, under HIPAA. HIPAA applies to health plans, healthcare providers who engage in certain standard healthcare transactions electronically, such as electronic billing, and healthcare clearinghouses, all of which are referred to as “covered entities” under HIPAA. HIPAA requires covered entities to comply with privacy regulations limiting the use and disclosure of PHI, or the Privacy Rule, and security regulations that require the implementation of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of such information, or the Security Rule. HIPAA also requires covered entities to provide notification to affected individuals and to the federal government in the event of a breach of unsecured PHI, or the Breach Notification Rule. Certain provisions of the Privacy Rule and all provisions of the Security Rule apply to “business associates,” or organizations that provide services to covered entities involving the use or disclosure of PHI. Business associates, like us, are subject to direct liability for violation of these provisions. In addition, a covered entity may be subject to criminal and civil penalties as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity. The HIPAA privacy and security rule impose and will continue to impose significant costs on us in order to comply with these standards.
 
In addition, certain states have proposed or enacted legislation that will create new data privacy and security obligations for certain entities, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act that went into effect January 1, 2020.
 
FCPA and Other Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Laws.   The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals or organizations in many countries. Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other U.S. and foreign laws, rules and/or regulations.
 
Physician Payment Sunshine Act.    Pursuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that was signed into law in March 2010, the federal government enacted the Physician Payment Sunshine Act. As a manufacturer of U.S. FDA-regulated devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs, we are subject to this law, which requires us to track and annually report certain payments and other transfers of value that we make to U.S.-licensed physicians or U.S. teaching hospitals. We are also required to report certain ownership interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. In 2018, the law was extended to require tracking and reporting of transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and other mid-level practitioners. Reporting requirements will go into effect in 2022 for payments and transfers of value made to these additional practitioner-types in 2021. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has the potential to impose penalties of up to $1.15 million per year for violations of the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, depending on the circumstances, and payments reported also have the potential to draw scrutiny on payments to and relationships with physicians, which may have implications under the Anti-Kickback Statute, Stark Law and other healthcare laws.
 
In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments and other transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities. Similar to the federal law, certain states also have adopted marketing and/or transparency laws relevant to device manufacturers, some of which are broader in scope. Certain states also mandate that device manufacturers implement compliance programs. Other states impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities. The need to build and maintain a robust compliance program with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements, resulting in fines and penalties.

International Laws and Regulations
 
International marketing and distribution of medical devices are subject to regulation by foreign governments, and such regulations may vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain marketing authorization in a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may differ. There is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards among the European Union, or EU, United States, Canada and various other industrialized countries.
 
The primary regulatory environment in Europe is that of the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. In the EEA, medical devices currently are required to comply with the Essential Requirements defined in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Directive, or MDD, (applicable in the non-EU EEA Member States via the Agreement on the EEA), a coordinated system for the authorization of medical devices. The directives and standards outlined in the MDD regulate the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive are entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout the EEA. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a “notified body.” A notified body is an organization designated by an EU country to assess the conformity of certain products before being placed on the market. These bodies carry out tasks related to conformity assessment procedures set out in the applicable legislation, when a third party is required. This third-party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer’s product. An assessment by a Notified Body of one country within the EU is required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the EU.
 
In 2017, EU regulatory bodies finalized a new Medical Device Regulation, which replaced the existing MDD framework and provided three years for transition and compliance, for a final effective date of May 26, 2020. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the European Parliament voted in April 2020 to postpone implementation of the Medical Device Regulation by one year, giving the medical device industry and Notified Bodies until May 26, 2021 to come into compliance, assuming no additional delays are needed. The Medical Device Regulation changes several aspects of the existing regulatory framework for medical device marketing in Europe and is expected to result in increased regulatory oversight of all medical devices marketed in the EU, which may, in turn, increase the costs, time and requirements that need to be met in order to place an innovative or high-risk medical device on the European market.
 
Outside of the EU, regulatory authorization needs to be sought on a country-by-country basis in order for us to market our products. Some countries have adopted medical device regulatory regimes, such as the Classification Rules for Medical Devices published by the Hong Kong Department of Health, the Health Sciences Authority of Singapore regulation of medical devices under the Health Products Act, and Health Canada’s risk classification system for invasive devices, among others. Each country may have its own processes and requirements for medical device licensing, approval/clearance, and regulation, therefore requiring us to seek marketing authorizations on a country-by-country basis.
 
Outside the United States, a range of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, as well and some industry-specific laws and codes of conduct, apply to the medical device industry and interactions with government officials and entities and healthcare professionals. Such laws include, but are not limited to the UK Bribery Act of 2010. Further, the EU member countries have emphasized a greater focus on healthcare fraud and abuse and have indicated greater attention to the industry by the European Anti-Fraud Office. Countries in Asia have also become more active in their enforcement of anti-bribery laws and with respect to procurement and supply chain fraud.
 
In the EU, increasingly stringent data protection and privacy rules that have and will continue to have substantial impact on the use of patient data across the healthcare industry became stronger in May 2018. We are subject to, and work to maintain compliance with, the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. The GDPR applies across the EU and includes, among other things, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and significant fines for non-compliance. The GDPR fine framework can be up to 20 million euros, or up to 4% of the company’s total global turnover of the preceding fiscal year, whichever is higher. The GDPR sets out a number of requirements that must be complied with when handling the personal data of such EU-based data subjects, including: providing expanded disclosures about how their personal data will be used; higher standards for organizations to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent or have another legal basis in place to justify their data processing activities; the obligation to appoint data protection officers in certain circumstances; new rights for individuals to be “forgotten” and rights to data portability, as well as enhanced current rights (e.g., access requests); the principal of accountability and demonstrating compliance through policies, procedures, training and audit; and the new mandatory data breach regime. In particular, medical or health data, genetic data and biometric data where the latter is used to uniquely identify an individual are all classified as “special category” data under the GDPR and are afforded greater protection and require additional compliance obligations. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, or orders to stop noncompliant activities. Due to the strong consumer protection aspects of the GDPR, companies subject to its purview must allocate substantial legal costs to the development of necessary policies and procedures and overall compliance efforts. We expect to incur continued costs associated with maintaining compliance with GDPR into the future.

We will also be subject to evolving EU laws on data export, where we transfer data outside the EU to ourselves, group companies or third parties. The GDPR only permits exports of data outside the EU to jurisdictions that ensure an adequate level of data protection. The United States has not been deemed to offer an adequate level of protection, so in order for us to transfer personal data from the EU to the United States, we must identify a legal basis for data transfer (e.g., the EU Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses). On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU, or CJEU, issued a landmark opinion in the case Maximilian Schrems vs. Facebook (Case C-311/18), or Schrems II. This decision (a) calls into question commonly relied upon data transfer mechanisms as between the EU member states and the United States (such as the Standard Contractual Clauses) and (b) invalidates the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield on which many companies had relied as an acceptable mechanism for transferring such data from the EU to the United States. The CJEU is the highest court in Europe and the Schrems II decision heightens the burden on data importers to assess U.S. national security laws on their business and future actions of EU data protection authorities are difficult to predict. Consequently, it is an ongoing challenge for data importers like us to identify compliant methods of data transfers necessary for their businesses. There is some risk of any of data transfers from the EU being halted.
 
Further, as a result of the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the EU on January 31, 2020, a decision often referred to as Brexit, there has been some uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the United Kingdom. While the Data Protection Act of 2018 that “implements” and complements the GDPR achieved Royal Assent on May 23, 2018 and is now effective in the United Kingdom, it was not clear whether a transfer of data from the EEA to the United Kingdom would remain lawful under GDPR as of the end of a Brexit transition period on December 31, 2020, when the United Kingdom was treated as a third country for purposes of the GDPR (and other EU laws). On December 24, 2020, the United Kingdom and the EU reached an agreement in principle on the EU-UK Trade Agreement, or the Trade Agreement. Under the Trade Agreement, for data protection purposes, there is a new transition period of up to six months to enable the European Commission to complete an adequacy assessment of the United Kingdom’s data protection laws. For the time being, personal data can continue to be exported from the EEA to the United Kingdom without a requirement that additional safeguards be adopted, and such transfers will not be prohibited by the GDPR. The new transition period began on January 1, 2021, and ends either (1) on the date which an adequacy decision in relation to the United Kingdom is adopted by the European Commission under the GDPR, or (2) four months after January 1, 2021, which the GDPR shall be extended by two months unless either the EU or the United Kingdom objects. If the European Commission does not reach an adequacy determination regarding United Kingdom data protection laws, transfers of personal data from the EU to the United Kingdom will be prohibited under the GDPR unless EU data exporters take further steps to ensure adequacy for such EU personal data.
