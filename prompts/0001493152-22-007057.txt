Backlog
 
The Company’s consolidated backlog of firm orders to be shipped in the next twelve months was approximately $11.7 million at December 31, 2021, compared to approximately $8.3 million at December 31, 2020. The increase in backlog is due to higher order flow from our T&M and RFC product groups as compared to the prior year. Excluding Microlab, the Company’s backlog at December 31, 2021 was $9.2 million which was approximately $2.1 million or 30% higher than December 31, 2020. It is anticipated that the majority of the backlog orders at December 31, 2021 will be filled during the current year. The stated backlog is not necessarily indicative of Company revenues for any future period nor is a backlog any assurance that the Company will realize a profit from the orders.
Inventory, Supplies and Manufacturing
 
The Company purchases components, devices and subassemblies from a wide variety of sources. The Company’s procurement policy requires maintaining adequate levels of raw materials inventory to minimize the Company’s production lead times with third-party suppliers and to improve the Company’s capacity to expedite fulfillment of customer orders. During 2021, the Company experienced component shortages and longer lead times from suppliers. Although there was no material impact to our consolidated financial statements in 2021 as a result of supply chain disruptions, continued component shortages or extended lead times in the future may have an adverse impact on the Company’s operations. For the year ended December 31, 2021 two suppliers each accounted for 12% of total consolidated inventory purchases. For the year ended December 31, 2020, two suppliers each accounted for 14% of total consolidated inventory purchases
 
The Company is not party to any long-term contracts regarding the deliveries of its supplies and components. It generally purchases such items pursuant to written purchase orders of both the individual and blanket variety. Blanket purchase orders usually cover the purchase of a larger amount of items at fixed prices for delivery and payment on specific dates.
 
For Boonton and Noisecom products, the Company develops, designs, manufactures, assembles, calibrates and tests the products at our facility in Parsippany, New Jersey. Testing of Boonton and Noisecom products is generally accomplished at the end of the manufacturing process and is performed in-house, as are all quality control processes.
 
Approximately 51% of Microlab’s revenues are traced to products that are sourced from offshore vendors. The majority of Microlab products that come from offshore suppliers are subject to tariffs. The remainder of Microlab products are designed and manufactured by the Company in Parsippany, New Jersey. All Microlab products are tested by the Company in Parsippany, New Jersey.
 
CommAgility hardware products are built by contract manufacturers to CommAgility designs and tested either by the contract manufacturer or by CommAgility. Software products are licensed to customers through a system that allows the customer to download the software once access has been granted.
 
Holzworth products are designed, developed, assembled and tested in our facility in Boulder, Colorado.
 
Warranty and Service
 
The Company typically provides one to three year warranties on all of its products covering both parts and labor. The Company, at its option, repairs or replaces products that are defective during the warranty period if the proper preventive maintenance procedures have been followed by its customers.
 
In cases of defective products the customer typically returns them to the Company’s facility. The Company’s service personnel typically repair the defective items and ship them back to the customer. Generally, all servicing is done at the Company’s facility, and the Company charges its customers a fee for those service items that are not covered by warranty. If the defective product cannot be repaired, the Company typically replaces the product free of charge but unrepairable products are an infrequent occurrence.
 
Product Liability Coverage
 
The testing of electronic communications equipment and the accurate transmission of information entail a risk of product liability to the Company. Product liability claims could be asserted against the Company by end-users of any of the Company’s products. The Company maintains product liability insurance coverage. No claims have been asserted for product liability due to a defective or malfunctioning device in the past five years.
