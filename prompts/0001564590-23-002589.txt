Overview
 Chinook is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing precision medicines for kidney diseases. Our pipeline is focused on rare, severe chronic kidney diseases with well-defined clinical pathways. Our lead clinical program is atrasentan, a potent and selective endothelin A receptor antagonist. We are currently conducting the phase 3 ALIGN trial of atrasentan for IgA nephropathy, or IgAN, and the phase 2 AFFINITY basket trial for proteinuric glomerular diseases. We most recently presented interim data from the IgAN patient cohort of the AFFINITY trial at the American Society of Nephrology, or ASN, Kidney Week in November 2022. In addition, enrollment in the ALIGN trial to date exceeds 270 patients. The interim proteinuria endpoint analysis will be performed on the first 270 patients enrolled, and we expect to report topline data from this analysis in the second half of 2023 to potentially support an application for accelerated approval under Subpart H in the United States. Our second product candidate, BION-1301, is an anti-APRIL monoclonal antibody also in phase 2 development for patients with IgAN. We most recently presented interim results from the ongoing phase 1/2 trial at ASN Kidney Week in November 2022. Our third product candidate is CHK-336, an oral small molecule lactate dehydrogenase, or LDHA, inhibitor for the treatment of primary and idiopathic hyperoxaluria that is currently in a phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers. In addition, we are conducting research programs in several other rare, severe chronic kidney diseases. We seek to build our pipeline by leveraging insights from kidney single cell RNA sequencing and large chronic kidney disease, or CKD, patient cohorts that have been comprehensively panomically phenotyped, with retained biosamples and prospective clinical follow-up, to discover and develop therapeutic candidates with mechanisms of action targeted against key kidney disease pathways. To support these efforts, we have an ongoing strategic collaboration with Evotec SE, or Evotec, to jointly identify, characterize and validate novel mechanisms and discover precision medicines for lupus nephritis, IgAN, polycystic kidney disease, or PKD, and other primary glomerular diseases. We also continue to evaluate opportunities to in-license kidney disease programs to bolster our pipeline. In November 2021, we established SanReno Therapeutics, or SanReno, a joint venture to develop, manufacture and commercialize kidney disease therapies in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and Singapore. We believe that a strong local presence in East Asia may allow us to accelerate the clinical development and maximize the commercial potential of atrasentan and BION-1301, the two programs licensed to SanReno, in the region.
 Chronic kidney disease is a large and growing problem globally, with few approved therapies and a large unmet medical need. Nearly one-in-ten people globally suffer from chronic kidney disease. In the United States alone, it is estimated that over $130 billion is spent annually on managing and treating kidney diseases, much of which is dedicated to dialysis, transplant and supportive care after a patient’s kidneys have already failed. Despite the large unmet medical need, there are few drugs approved to prevent the progression of kidney disease. Drug development in nephrology has historically been hindered by categorization of disease based on clinical presentation or kidney pathology, rather than underlying molecular mechanism or genetics. This has resulted in the development of drugs with non-specific mechanisms to address broad indications that contain heterogeneous patient populations with a variety of distinct disease drivers. Complicating matters, large, lengthy and expensive clinical outcome-based clinical trials have been required to establish proof of concept and regulatory approval for new drugs.
 We believe now is an opportune time for precision medicine to be applied in kidney disease, since many of the historical barriers can be overcome. The field is rapidly changing as an increased understanding of underlying disease biology has led to new and validated drug targets, novel translational platforms, and patient stratification tools. Importantly, regulators have recently accepted biomarkers such as proteinuria and eGFR as registration endpoints in certain well-characterized disease populations, potentially reducing the time and cost previously associated with clinical trials in nephrology.
 Our approach to precision medicines leverages recent advances in identifying targeted kidney therapies linked to mechanistic biomarkers by the application of systems biology approaches in nephrology. The application of this approach in nephrology has advanced over the past decade through the study of multiple patient groups across a wide variety of kidney diseases and their associated multilevel data sets, including genome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, pathology and prospective long-term clinical characteristics and outcomes. A key objective of these investigations is to define kidney diseases in molecular terms to drive the development of targeted treatments. We believe we are well-positioned to exploit the insights provided into the key molecular drivers and classifiers of kidney diseases by the application of these systems biology tools to nephrology. Our strategy is to use these mechanistic insights to select compelling drug targets and deliver novel and differentiated product candidates for rare and severe kidney diseases with high unmet medical need.
 We believe our research and discovery approach provides significant insights into human disease mechanisms and allows us to select and validate key targets that are central drivers of human kidney diseases.
 Atrasentan
 Our lead product candidate is atrasentan, a potent and selective endothelin A receptor, or ETA receptor, antagonist that we are developing for the treatment of proteinuric glomerular diseases. In March 2021 we initiated a phase 3 trial of atrasentan called ALIGN for IgAN, and in April 2021 we initiated a phase 2 basket trial called AFFINITY for proteinuric glomerular diseases.

IgAN is the leading cause of primary glomerulonephritis worldwide, with an estimated incidence of 1.3 per 100,000 individuals per year in the United States. The global incidence of IgAN is approximately 2.5 per 100,000 individuals per year. Variations in disease incidence and prevalence are, in part, due to regional differences in urine screening, referral patterns and indications for biopsy.  
 We estimate that IgAN is associated with progressive loss of kidney function leading to end-stage kidney disease, or ESKD, in approximately 30% to 45% of IgAN patients over 20 to 25 years, representing a significant unmet need for new treatment options. Galactose-deficient immunoglobulin A1, or Gd-IgA1, is recognized as a critical autoantigen to which IgAN patients develop circulating autoantibodies, resulting in the formation and deposition of immune complexes in the glomeruli of the kidney. This process initiates an inflammatory cascade that damages the glomeruli, resulting in proteinuria or hematuria. Ultimately the filtration function of the kidney is impaired, reducing the ability to remove waste products from the blood. As the disease progresses, these waste products accumulate and can result in potentially life-threatening complications that often lead to the need for dialysis or kidney transplant. Sustained proteinuria is the most widely studied and the strongest predictor for the rate of progression to ESKD in IgAN.
 Activation of the ETA receptor has been implicated as a key driver of proteinuria, renal cell injury, including podocyte dysfunction and mesangial cell activation, along with promoting kidney inflammation and fibrosis, all resulting in the progression of IgAN. Atrasentan, by blocking ETA, has the potential to provide benefit in multiple chronic kidney diseases by reducing proteinuria and having direct anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects to preserve kidney function. We in-licensed atrasentan in December 2019 from AbbVie, which previously developed atrasentan for diabetic kidney disease, or DKD, through multiple clinical trials, including the phase 3 SONAR trial, which evaluated atrasentan in over 5,000 DKD patients. We presented new preclinical data elucidating the mechanism of action of atrasentan in IgAN at multiple nephrology congresses in 2021 and 2022, including most recently at ASN Kidney Week in November 2022. In preclinical studies, atrasentan rapidly reduced albuminuria and downregulated intra-renal transcriptional proliferative, inflammatory and fibrotic signaling in the gddY mouse IgAN model. The data also showed that atrasentan attenuated human renal mesangial cell activation induced by endothelin-1 or IgAN patient immune-derived immune complexes in a translational model system. Additionally, preclinical data presented at ASN Kidney Week in November 2022 on single-cell RNA-seq of a mouse model of IgAN, revealed a prominent expansion of failed repair proximal tubular epithelial cells, which was reversed by atrasentan but not ACE inhibition.
 In 2015, AbbVie made a strategic decision to exit kidney disease drug development and ultimately discontinued the SONAR trial in 2017 when less than half of the planned events had occurred due to a lower than predicted annual occurrence of the primary renal outcome. Clinical investigators closed the trial per protocol during which time further events accrued, and in April 2019 the data was reported at the WCN and simultaneously published in The Lancet. At that time, after only 184 out of a planned 425 events had been observed, the trial showed a statistically significant p-value of 0.029 on its primary endpoint of a composite of hard kidney outcomes, consisting of time to first occurrence of progression to ESKD or doubling of serum creatinine. In the SONAR trial, atrasentan also demonstrated statistically significant reductions in proteinuria as well as improvements in the estimated glomerular filtration rate, or eGFR, both of which are measures of kidney function. Trial results showed atrasentan having well-characterized and manageable safety results in this high-risk DKD patient population. Fluid retention-related adverse events were more frequent in the atrasentan group than in the placebo group; however, these adverse events are a known class effect of endothelin receptor antagonists, and they were anticipated and generally well-managed in this high-risk diabetic population.
 Based on the encouraging data from SONAR and strong mechanistic rationale, we initiated the phase 3 ALIGN trial of atrasentan in patients with IgAN at high risk of kidney function decline in March 2021. We chose IgAN as the lead indication for evaluation of atrasentan due to the role of endothelin activation and proteinuria in disease progression, potential improved tolerability of atrasentan in this patient population, high unmet need and the possibility of submitting a new drug application, or NDA, seeking accelerated approval based on surrogate endpoints, including proteinuria. In April 2021 we initiated the phase 2 AFFINITY trial in proteinuric glomerular diseases, including cohorts of patients with lower proteinuria IgAN, focal segmental glomerosclerosis, or FSGS, and Alport syndrome, as well as DKD combined with sodium glucose co-transporter 2, or SGLT2, inhibitors, such as canagliflozin, dapagliflozin or empagliflozin, which have recently been shown to provide clinical benefit in patients with multiple types of chronic kidney disease. 
 We most recently presented interim data from the IgAN patient cohort of the AFFINITY trial in a poster presentation at ASN Kidney Week in November 2022 where atrasentan demonstrated consistent and clinically meaningful proteinuria reductions at weeks six, 12 and 24 of treatment in patients with IgAN already on a maximally tolerated and stable dose of a RAS inhibitor. As of the October 19, 2022 data cutoff, atrasentan demonstrated mean reductions in 24-hour urine protein creatinine ratio, or UPCR, of 38.1% at six weeks of treatment, 48.3% at 12 weeks of treatment and 54.7% at 24 weeks of treatment. After 24 weeks of treatment, 15 of the 19 patients (79%) who had completed this visit had greater than a 40% reduction in proteinuria. Atrasentan was well-tolerated, with no treatment-related serious or severe adverse events. The mean treatment duration was 45 weeks, with time on treatment ranging from 13 to 52 weeks. There were no meaningful changes in blood pressure or acute eGFR effects, suggesting proteinuria reductions were not primarily due to hemodynamic effects of atrasentan. There were no increases in brain natriuretic peptide, or BNP, or mean bodyweight, suggesting minimal fluid retention.

We plan to present data from additional cohorts of the AFFINITY trial during the second half of 2023. In addition, enrollment in the ALIGN trial to date exceeds 270 patients. . The interim proteinuria endpoint analysis will be performed on the first 270 patients enrolled, and we expect to report topline data from this analysis in the second half of 2023 to potentially support an application for accelerated approval under Subpart H in the United States. 
BION-1301
 We are also developing BION-1301, an investigational humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that blocks APRIL, a TNF-family cytokine involved in B-cell signaling that is believed to be implicated in IgAN and other indications, from binding to its receptors.
 Patients with IgAN have significantly higher levels of APRIL than healthy individuals, and higher APRIL levels in these patients correlate with poor prognosis in the form of increased Gd-IgA1, increased proteinuria and decreased eGFR. Published literature has demonstrated that APRIL critically drives IgA class switching, the survival of IgA-producing plasma cells and the secretion of Gd-IgA1 (Hit 1 in the multi-hit pathogenesis of IgAN). Blocking APRIL with BION-1301 is a distinct approach to treating IgAN by reducing circulating levels of Gd-IgA1, which is considered to be the pathogenic variant of IgA in IgAN. We believe BION-1301 represents a novel potential disease-modifying treatment for IgAN.
 A phase 1/2 clinical trial of BION-1301 is currently underway. Parts 1 and 2 of this trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of BION-1301 in healthy volunteers have been completed, and Part 3 of this trial evaluating BION-1301 in patients with IgAN is ongoing. We most recently presented interim data from Cohorts 1 and 2 of Part 3 of this trial at ASN Kidney Week in November 2022. Patients in Cohort 1 started treatment at an intravenous, or IV, BION-1301 dose of 450 mg every two weeks, and after at least 24 weeks of treatment, all patients transitioned to subcutaneous, or SC, dosing at 600 mg every two weeks. In Cohort 2, patients started treatment at a SC BION-1301 dose of 600 mg every two weeks. In both cohorts, patients can receive treatment for up to a total of two years.
 The data presented at ASN demonstrated BION-1301’s disease-modifying potential in IgAN by generating rapid and durable reductions in mechanistic biomarkers and corresponding clinically meaningful proteinuria reductions within three months of initiating treatment, which was consistent across both cohorts. In Cohort 1, reductions in IgA and Gd-IgA1 were maintained beyond 52 weeks of treatment. Reductions in IgM, and to a lesser extent IgG, were also observed. In Cohort 1, BION-1301 demonstrated mean reductions in 24-hour UPCR of 30.4% in seven patients at 12 weeks of treatment, 48.8% in all eight patients at 24 weeks of treatment, 66.9% in all eight patients at 52 weeks of treatment, 67.4% in four patients at 76 weeks of treatment and 71.0% in two patients at 100 weeks of treatment. In Cohort 2, SC BION-1301 treatment resulted in rapid and sustained reductions in IgA and Gd-IgA1, IgM, and to a lesser extent IgG, through 24 weeks of treatment, highly consistent with Cohort 1. BION-1301 also demonstrated mean reductions in 24-hour UPCR of 28.7% in 15 patients at 12 weeks of treatment and 53.8% in 9 patients at 24 weeks of treatment, similar to reductions observed at the same timepoints in Cohort 1. In both cohorts, BION-1301 was well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events or treatment discontinuations due to adverse events and no anti-drug antibodies were observed. 
 Based on the data generated to date in the ongoing phase 1/2 study, we plan to advance BION-1301 into a phase 3 trial with the current Cohort 2 dose of 600 mg SC every two weeks. We have finalized our trial design, are conducting site and country feasibility assessments, pursuing regulatory interactions and manufacturing drug product for the trial, with a plan of initiating a global phase 3 trial of BION-1301 in mid-2023. We also have received orphan drug designation for BION-1301 for the treatment of primary IgAN from the European Commission. 
 CHK-336
 Our third product candidate is CHK-336, a liver-targeted oral small molecule LDHA inhibitor, which we are developing for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria, or PH, and idiopathic hyperoxaluria. Hyperoxalurias, including PH, are diseases caused by excess oxalate, a potentially toxic metabolite typically filtered by the kidneys and excreted as a waste product in urine. Symptoms of PH include recurrent kidney stones, which when left untreated, can result in kidney failure requiring dialysis or dual kidney/liver transplantation. In patients with hyperoxalurias, excess oxalate combines with calcium to form calcium oxalate crystals that deposit in the kidney, resulting in the formation of painful kidney stones and driving progressive kidney damage over time. PH1, PH2 and PH3 are a group of ultra-rare diseases caused by genetic mutations that result in excess oxalate, and in their most severe forms, can lead to ESKD at a young age. We presented a poster on CHK-336 at ASN Kidney Week in November 2022, demonstrating preclinical efficacy in PH1 and PH2 mouse models, and describing the potential for benefit in non-genetic hyperoxalurias caused by oxalate overproduction. We are currently conducting a phase 1 single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose clinical trial in healthy volunteers evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of CHK-336, and we expect to report initial data from this trial in the first half of 2023. We have also received rare pediatric disease designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for CHK-336 for the treatment of PH.

Research and Discovery Programs
 Beyond CHK-336, we have active research and discovery efforts focused on other rare, severe kidney diseases. Our precision medicine research approach focuses on developing product candidates targeting the most promising molecular pathways identified as key disease drivers in collaboration with key scientific advisors. Our scientific advisors provide valuable guidance on target selection, prioritization and validation strategies, as well as access to technology platforms that support target validation efforts through biological insights into human disease mechanisms and translational cellular and animal model systems.
 In March 2021, we announced a strategic collaboration with Evotec focused on the joint identification, characterization and validation of novel mechanisms as well as the discovery of precision medicines for lupus nephritis, IgAN, PKD and other primary glomerular diseases. The collaboration leverages access to the National Unified Renal Translational Research Enterprise, or NURTuRE, patient biobank for chronic kidney diseases and nephrotic syndrome as well as Evotec’s proprietary PanOmics platform, which combines enhanced throughput proteomics, high throughput transcriptomics and cell imaging with PanHunter, Evotec’s unique data analysis platform. 
 Our Pipeline
 We have assembled a portfolio of precision medicine product candidates designed to address rare, severe chronic kidney diseases with potentially well-defined and efficient clinical pathways. We intend to further enhance our portfolio by identifying novel kidney disease targets for research and development and in-licensing promising product candidates for kidney diseases. Our development programs consist of the following:
Our Strategy
 Our goal is to be a leader in the discovery, development and commercialization of precision medicines to treat kidney diseases. Our strategy includes the following key components:
 Continue to advance the phase 3 ALIGN trial of atrasentan for IgAN towards an expected topline data readount from the interim proteinuria endpoint analysis in the second half of 2023, and present data from additional cohorts of the phase 2 AFFINITY basket trial for proteinuric glomerular diseases beginning in the second half of 2023. In March 2021 we initiated the phase 3 ALIGN trial of our lead product candidate, atrasentan, for IgAN. We received feedback from the FDA, and the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, on the design of our phase 3 trial, which utilizes reduction in proteinuria after 24 weeks of treatment as the primary endpoint to support an application for accelerated approval under Subpart H in the United States, and reduction in eGFR decline following 2.5 years of treatment followed by a wash-out period as the potential confirmatory endpoint for full approval, if accelerated approval is granted. Enrollment in the ALIGN trial to date exceeds 270 patients. The interim proteinuria endpoint analysis will be performed on the first 270 patients enrolled, and we expect to report topline data from this analysis in the second half of 2023. We believe the hemodynamic, anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties of atrasentan, as well as its impact to reduce mesangial cell activation, could provide significant clinical benefit on top of standard-of-care renin-angiotensin inhibitors, or RASis, for patients with IgAN. In April 2021 we initiated the phase 2 AFFINITY basket trial in proteinuric glomerular diseases. We most recently presented interim data from the IgAN patient cohort of the AFFINITY trial in a poster presentation at ASN Kidney Week in November 2022, and we plan to present data from additional cohorts of the AFFINITY trial during the second half of 2023.

Initiate a global phase 3 trial of BION-1301 for IgAN in 2023. Based on the data generated to date in the ongoing phase 1/2 study, we plan to advance BION-1301 into a phase 3 trial with the current Cohort 2 dose of 600 mg SC every two weeks. We have finalized our trial design, are conducting site and country feasibility and pursuing regulatory interactions, with a plan of initiating a global phase 3 trial of BION-1301 in mid-2023.
Report data on CHK-336 from the phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers and initiate phase 2 POC trials for patients with primary and idiopathic hyperoxaluria. We are currently conducting a phase 1 single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose clinical trial in healthy volunteers evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of CHK-336, and we expect to report initial data from this trial in the first half of 2023. We believe CHK-336 could represent an important new treatment option for patients with diseases caused by excess oxalate production and will continue to advance CHK-336 into proof-of-concept, or POC, trials for both primary and idiopathic hyperoxaluria.
 Identify and validate novel targets and utilize translational platforms to develop a pipeline of product candidates for rare, severe chronic kidney diseases. Our chemistry and biology teams have partnered with our academic founders and key opinion leaders, to identify, validate and develop precision medicines to add to our preclinical pipeline. Our lead program from these internal research efforts is CHK-336 for hyperoxalurias, and we also have multiple active research programs underway in other rare, severe chronic kidney diseases. Our collaboration with Evotec will supplement our internal efforts to define the molecular drivers of kidney diseases, identify novel targets for drug development in selected patient sub-populations and continue to build the foundation for our precision medicine approach.
 Enhance our product portfolio by identifying novel disease targets and in-licensing promising product candidates for kidney diseases. We are actively evaluating and pursuing novel targets, intellectual property and product candidates for acquisition and in-licensing to supplement our internal research efforts and continue to build our pipeline of precision medicines for kidney disease. Through our team’s focus and expertise in kidney disease, as well as our connections within the nephrology community, we are positioning the company as a partner of choice for promising renal programs. We believe continued advances in the biological understanding of kidney diseases will provide opportunities to further expand our portfolio with preclinical and/or clinical product candidates.
 Maintain broad commercial rights to our product candidates. We plan to maintain commercial rights for atrasentan and BION-1301 in North America and possibly Europe. In November 2021, we also established SanReno Therapeutics, a joint venture in China to develop, manufacture and commercialize kidney disease therapies in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and Singapore. There is a large unmet medical need due to the higher incidence and prevalence of IgAN among east-Asian populations, and we believe it is important to have a strong local presence that may allow us to accelerate the clinical development and maximize the commercial potential of atrasentan and BION-1301 in the region. As we continue to advance our programs, we may pursue additional strategic collaborations to share risk and supplement our resources at the appropriate time, especially in regions outside of North America.
 Continue to strengthen and expand our intellectual property portfolio. We have an intellectual property portfolio that includes issued and pending claims for atrasentan and BION-1301, as well as pending claims relating to CHK-336, in the United States and other countries. We will also look to in-license any third-party patents relating to our pipeline programs as needed. Our proprietary position is reinforced by additional technical know-how and trade secrets. We continually assess and refine our intellectual property strategy and will file additional patent applications as appropriate.
 Chronic Kidney Disease Background
 CKD is a large and growing problem globally. In 2017, the global prevalence of CKD was 9.4 percent (697.3 million cases) and CKD has risen from the 29th leading cause of global disability-adjusted life-years, or DALYs, in 1990 for all ages to the 18th leading cause in 2019. Overall, nearly one in ten people around the world have CKD. In the United States alone, the health care system spends over $130 billion annually on kidney disease, much of which is dedicated to dialysis and transplant after a patient’s kidneys have already failed. There have been few new drugs developed and approved for chronic kidney diseases over the past several decades. Current management of CKD largely consists of supportive care, focused mainly on controlling high blood pressure with medications. Therefore, there is a large unmet medical need for therapies that can delay or prevent progression of kidney disease, preserve kidney function and improve quality of life for people living with kidney disease. We are focused initially on developing atrasentan and BION-1301 in IgAN and other proteinuric glomerular diseases.
Immunoglobulin A Nephropathy (IgAN)
 IgAN is the most common primary glomerular disease in the developed world and a leading cause of CKD and ESKD, requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation. Although the disease may follow a benign clinical course in many patients, it is estimated that up to 45 percent of IgAN patients will develop ESKD, requiring dialysis or kidney transplant, over a period of 20 to 25 years. IgAN is most 
 9

commonly diagnosed in the second or third decade of life and more commonly affects males in North America and Europe, while having equal gender prevalence in Asia. There is considerable regional and ethnic variation in the epidemiology of IgAN, with a higher incidence in Caucasians and Asians and a lower incidence in individuals of African descent. Worldwide, the incidence of IgAN has been estimated at 2.5 per 100,000. Limited data from population-based studies in the United States indicate that the annual incidence of biopsy-proven disease is approximately 1.3 per 100,000, giving rise to a lifetime risk of approximately one per 1,400 adults.
Recent research has suggested that an abnormal mucosal immune response stimulating the production of Gd-IgA1 (Hit 1), which is recognized as an autoantigen by circulating autoantibodies (Hit 2), may be the initiating event causing IgAN. As demonstrated in the figure below, immune recognition results in the formation of pathogenic immune complexes (Hit 3) that deposit in the kidney and activate mesangial cells (Hit 4), which are key cells in the kidney that provide structural support to the glomerulus. Activated mesangial cells proliferate and produce excess amounts of extracellular matrix components, such as cytokines and chemokines. Mesangial cell-podocyte crosstalk results in proteinuria, which is a key driver of disease progression and subsequent kidney function loss.
 Excessive tubular reabsorption of filtered proteins is thought to stimulate a pro-inflammatory response in tubular epithelial cells that results in the secretion of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and vasoactive molecules into the tubulointerstitial space. This results in interstitial inflammation and fibrosis, which drives kidney function decline.

The clinical presentation of IgAN is heterogenous and can range from intermittent hematuria and low-level proteinuria with a benign clinical course over time and a low risk of progression to ESKD, to a more aggressive form with high levels of proteinuria and rapid loss of kidney function. Given the variable disease course, a major advance in the care of IgAN patients is the recognition of prognostic factors that can identify patients at greater risk of progression to ESKD. These prognostic markers include the presence of hypertension, evidence of reduced eGFR, and the presence of sustained proteinuria of more than one gram per day. These factors, in addition to biopsy histologic characteristics, prior medication use and race/ethnicity, have given rise to a risk prediction tool that can stratify newly diagnosed patients into risk groups. Of these various factors, the strongest risk factor for rapid progression, identified through multivariate analyses, is sustained proteinuria. The importance of this factor was demonstrated in multiple studies showing that proteinuria over one gram per day was associated with more rapid kidney function loss in a dose-dependent fashion, and that interventions that reduce proteinuria to below one gram per day led to decreased risk of kidney failure. Therefore, clinical management of IgAN is focused on reduction of proteinuria in order to slow progression of kidney function loss.
 Importantly, in patients whose proteinuria at diagnosis was greater than three grams per day, treatments that resulted in proteinuria reduction to less than one gram per day generally led to slowing of kidney function loss to a rate that was comparable to those with less than one gram per day proteinuria values at diagnosis. It is estimated that for every one-gram per day increase in proteinuria over a baseline of one gram per day there is a 10 to 25-fold higher risk of kidney failure.
 10

The primary focus of patient management is to control glomerular pressure through the administration of hypertension medications, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers, or ARBs, as well as lifestyle management such as dietary salt restriction, smoking cessation, weight control and exercise. Patients who fail conservative management and continue to have levels of proteinuria greater than one gram per day have limited established safe and effective treatment options. Current treatment guidelines suggest that a six-month course of glucocorticoids can be administered to these patients, although the potential for toxicity needs to be carefully considered. There are only two drugs approved for the treatment of IgAN: Tarpeyo (budesonide), a corticosteroid, and Filspari (sparsentan), a dual ARB/endothelin receptor antagonist. Both drugs received accelerated approval based on a reduction in proteinuria for patients at risk of rapid progression, which is defined as those generally having UPCR > 1.5g/g. It has not yet been established whether either Tarpeyo or Filspari slow kidney function decline in patients with IgAN.
Other Proteinuric Glomerular Diseases
 Many glomerular diseases, such as FSGS, Alport syndrome, membranous nephropathy and sickle cell nephropathy, include proteinuria as an important feature in disease progression. These glomerular diseases currently have very limited treatment options that often involve immunosuppressive therapy. For example, FSGS is an important cause of ESKD. There are currently no FDA-approved pharmacologic treatments for FSGS, and off-label treatments are limited to ACE inhibitors and ARBs, steroids and other immunosuppressant agents, which are effective in only a subset of patients. The global incidence of FSGS has been estimated at eight per million people and we estimate that there are approximately 40,000 FSGS patients in the United States and a similar number in Europe. Additionally, Alport syndrome is a rare, genetic form of CKD caused by mutations in the genes encoding type IV collagen, which is a major structural component of the glomeruli in the kidney. Patients with Alport syndrome experience a progressive worsening of the kidney’s capacity to filter waste products out of the blood, which can lead to ESKD and the need for chronic dialysis treatment or a kidney transplant. Alport syndrome affects both children and adults. In patients with the most severe forms of the disease, approximately 50 percent progress to dialysis by age 25, 90 percent by age 40, and nearly 100 percent by age 60. According to the Alport Syndrome Foundation, the disease affects approximately 30,000 to 60,000 people in the United States. There are currently no approved therapies to treat Alport syndrome, and current management focuses on blood pressure control.
Our Product Candidates
 Atrasentan
 Our lead product candidate is atrasentan, a potent and selective endothelin A receptor antagonist that we are developing for the treatment of proteinuric glomerular diseases. Atrasentan is designed to reduce proteinuria and slow the progression of IgAN. In March 2021 we initiated a phase 3 trial of atrasentan called ALIGN for the treatment of IgAN, and in April 2021, we initiated a phase 2 basket trial called AFFINITY for the treatment of proteinuric glomerular diseases.
Endothelin System in Chronic Kidney Disease
 The endothelin, or ET, system consists of three peptides, ET-1, ET-2 and ET-3, which typically act locally. ET-1 is considered of most biological relevance to kidney physiology and disease. Two ET receptors, ETA and ETB, mediate the effects of the ET peptides. ETA receptor activation typically results in blood vessel constriction, cellular proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition, whereas ETB activation generally opposes these effects producing blood vessel dilation, antiproliferative and antifibrotic responses.
 In kidney physiology, the ET system modulates regional kidney blood flow, mesangial cell and podocyte function and tubular acid/base handling. The ET system also regulates sodium and water excretion, so blockade of ET receptors can be accompanied by fluid retention, which is a known clinical observation with this class of agents.
 The kidney ET system is activated in virtually all causes of experimental and human CKD in which it has been investigated, irrespective of the initiating cause. Activation of the ETA receptor by ET-1 has been implicated as a key driver of proteinuria, renal 
 11

cell injury, including podocyte dysfunction and mesangial cell activation, along with promoting kidney inflammation and fibrosis, all resulting in the progression of CKD. The key effects of ETA activation in CKD are shown in the figure below.

ET-1 is a potent vasoconstrictor and its effects contribute to systemic and local increases in blood pressure in the kidney that support the progression of CKD. While this effect can help maintain glomerular filtration rate, or GFR, in the short term, ultimately, it is maladaptive and a central driver of kidney damage and CKD progression.
 ETA activation also appears to have additional direct negative effects in CKD, independent of its effects on blood pressure. These additional effects include increased permeability of the glomerular filtration barrier to proteins leading to proteinuria, mesangial cell activation and kidney inflammation and fibrosis. Pharmacological studies indicate that these pathogenic effects are primarily mediated by the ETA receptor. Combined, these observations have encouraged the investigation of ETA inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy in CKD.
 ET pathway activation has been documented in patients with IgAN. High kidney levels of ET-1 are often seen in patients with IgAN with high levels of proteinuria, and predict rapid progression of IgAN. 
 Mechanism of Action of Atrasentan
 Atrasentan is designed to be a potent, selective blocker of the ETA receptor to reduce proteinuria, kidney inflammation and fibrosis, and delay the progression of kidney function loss. In preclinical studies, atrasentan has shown substantially more potency as an ETA receptor antagonist than ETB, with an ETA inhibition constant [Ki] = 0.034 nanomolar, or nM, more than 1,800-fold selective over ETB ([Ki] = 63.3 nM). We believe atrasentan has the required selectivity profile for therapeutic benefit in CKD, while minimizing the potential for fluid retention.
 Previous Clinical Development of Atrasentan
 We in-licensed atrasentan from Abbvie in late 2019. Before AbbVie made the strategic decision to terminate development of atrasentan, it had been investigated in multiple phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials involving approximately 622 healthy volunteers, 2,000 patients with prostate cancer and more than 5,000 patients with DKD. Atrasentan is designed to be orally bioavailable, readily absorbed with linear dose proportionality and administered once daily. Dedicated pharmacokinetic studies in special populations have demonstrated that no dose adjustment was needed based on race, degree of renal impairment, or mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Population pharmacokinetic studies have shown that the only factor significantly affecting atrasentan exposure was body weight. In prior trials, the recommended dose for evaluating atrasentan in patients with DKD was determined to be 0.75 mg daily, which resulted in the greatest proteinuria reduction with least fluid retention.
 Atrasentan demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in proteinuria, as assessed by urine albumin to creatinine ratio, or UACR, in multiple phase 2 and phase 3 trials in patients with DKD. In these trials, the change in UACR was generally observed within the first two weeks after treatment initiation and remained stable thereafter for the duration of chronic 
 12

administration. Across phase 2 and phase 3 trials, the placebo-adjusted mean reduction in proteinuria was approximately 30 to 35 percent, although considerable intra-subject and inter-subject variability has been observed.
 From 2013 to 2017, AbbVie conducted the global phase 3 SONAR trial, which was a randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled, multicenter study designed to assess the effects of atrasentan on renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD while they continued to be treated with the current standard of care. Despite early termination of the trial by AbbVie in 2017 for strategic reasons and due to a lower than anticipated accrual of primary endpoint events, patients who remained on trial and reached the primary endpoint of at least a 30 percent reduction in UACR following an initial six-week open label enrichment period with daily atrasentan experienced a clinically important and statistically significant improvement on the primary composite renal endpoint of time to doubling of serum creatinine or progression to ESKD (p-value=0.029). A similarly favorable trend was also observed in a smaller cohort of patients with a less than 30 percent UACR reduction in response to atrasentan following the six-week enrichment period (p-value=0.15).
 The following figure shows mean UACR change from baseline to recovery for the placebo, 0.75 milligrams per day, or mg/d, atrasentan, and 1.25 mg/d atrasentan groups in AbbVie’s phase 2b RADAR trial. The RADAR trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial completed in 2012 that tested in 161 patients the effects of atrasentan on albuminuria reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy who were treated with the maximum tolerated labeled dose of a Renin Angiotensin System, or RAS, inhibitor.
 

The following figure shows the mean UACR levels in SONAR among the patients that experienced at least a 30 percent reduction in UACR following the initial six-week open label enrichment period. Among these 2,648 patients, UACR decreased from 
 13

baseline by an average of 51.8 percent during the enrichment period. During the double-blind period, UACR increased in the placebo group as compared to the atrasentan group (a difference of 33.6 percent, p-value<0.0001).
 


We believe the observed reduction in UACR across multiple clinical trials, as well as the favorable results observed on long-term renal outcomes, provide strong rationale for clinical evaluation of atrasentan in IgAN, a disease in which clinical management is centered around proteinuria reduction.
 The most common and consistent safety findings across clinical studies of atrasentan in the DKD patient population were fluid retention and associated manifestations and dilutional anemia. In the phase 3 SONAR trial, fluid retention events were reported in approximately 26 percent of atrasentan-treated patients within the first six weeks. During the double-blind period, events of fluid retention were higher in the atrasentan groups (36.6 percent) than placebo groups (32.3 percent); however, across the population, atrasentan was associated with less than a one-kilogram increase in body weight and a six percent increase in brain natriuretic peptide levels, which is a peptide that is associated with fluid retention. In the phase 3 SONAR trial for patients with DKD, atrasentan was associated with a numerically higher, but not statistically significantly increased risk of heart failure hospitalizations due to fluid retention. Over time, anemia events were reported in approximately 18 percent of atrasentan patients compared with ten percent of placebo treated patients, with mean change in hemoglobin between groups of approximately one g/dL; these findings are consistent with mechanism-based hemodilution. Notably, there were no significant differences in adverse events leading to discontinuation during the double-blind treatment period between atrasentan and the placebo group. Importantly, no liver toxicity signal has been observed in over 5,000 patients with DKD treated for up to five years in the phase 3 SONAR study and nearly 2,000 prostate cancer patients at much higher doses. We currently have accumulated a total of over 5,000 patient years of treatment with atrasentan across all trials. 
 As a class, endothelin receptor antagonists have a well-characterized embryo-fetal toxicity profile, resulting in Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, programs and mandatory birth control for women of child-bearing age. Filspari (sparsentan), a dual ARB/endothelin receptor antagonist that was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in February 2022 for adult patients with IgAN at risk of rapid progression, has a black box warning for embryo-fetal toxicity and is only available through the Filspari REMS. The black box warning states that based on animal data, Filspari can cause major birth defects if used during pregnancy. Pregnancy testing is required before, during and after treatment with Filspari. Patients who can become pregnant must use effective contraception prior to initiation of treatment, during treatment and for one month after treatment with Filspari. We expect the FDA to require similar restrictions on the use of atrasentan, if approved. The endothelin system is also known to play a role in spermatogenesis, and although atrasentan was linked to reduced sperm concentrations in a small study (n=17) evaluating the effect of atrasentan on sperm concentration, sperm concentrations subsequently recovered in the four affected patients to within the normal range following drug discontinuation. The impact of long-term atrasentan treatment on spermatogenesis and male fertility is not known.
 Due to the differences in IgAN and DKD, we expect that the patient population in the phase 3 ALIGN trial of atrasentan will be younger and have fewer cardiovascular co-morbidities than in the SONAR study. Though patients in each clinical trial have a unique set of baseline characteristics, the median age of patients in the atrasentan phase 2 AFFINITY IgAN cohort was 45 years old and the mean ages of patients in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 of the phase 1/2 trial of BION-1301 in IgAN were 42 and 40 years old respectively, while the mean age of patients in the SONAR trial was 65 years old. Additionally, patients with DKD are at greater risk of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure and stroke than the non-diabetic population.

The diuretic effects achieved with SGLT2 inhibitors may offset the fluid retention effects of atrasentan, while the effects on albuminuria and kidney protection of both drug classes may be complementary due to distinct mechanisms of action. A third-party post-hoc analysis of the SONAR trial showed that in 14 patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD, six-weeks of treatment with atrasentan combined with an SGLT2 inhibitor versus atrasentan alone decreased body weight, a surrogate for fluid retention, and further decreased albuminuria. We believe this data and the increasing use of SGLT2 inhibitors in the non-diabetic CKD population provide rationale for the exploration of the long-term efficacy and safety of atrasentan in combination with SGLT2 inhibitors in IgAN.
 Rationale for Atrasentan Development in IgAN
 Chronic proteinuric kidney diseases, including IgAN and other proteinuric glomerular diseases, are characterized by progressive renal function loss, accompanied by excessive levels of urinary protein excretion, and have been proposed to progress by a final common pathway, irrespective of initiating cause. Glomerular hypertension, a maladaptive response to reduced kidney function, along with increased glomerular permeability results in the increased filtration of plasma proteins, which causes proteinuria. The consequent excess exposure of protein to glomerular and tubular epithelial cells has been shown preclinically to play a key pathogenic role in the progression of CKD. Kidney cells exposed to an excessive protein load release pro-fibrotic factors that can act locally to drive glomerulosclerosis. In vitro and in vivo studies have been used to develop a model of the final common pathway whereby excessive tubular reabsorption of filtered proteins stimulates a pro-inflammatory response that results in the secretion of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and vasoactive molecules into the tubulointerstitial space. This results in interstitial inflammation and fibrosis, which drive renal function decline.
 Clinical evidence consistent with proteinuria as a causal factor in CKD pathogenesis includes the observation that proteinuria is an independent predictor of disease progression. In IgAN, there appears to be a dose-dependent effect of proteinuria on the risk of renal progression, beginning at a urinary protein excretion rate of greater than one gram per day, with increasing levels of proteinuria associated with increased risk of ESKD. Sustained proteinuria has demonstrated to be the most important predictor of the rate of kidney progression in IgAN and sustained improvements in proteinuria to less than one gram per day are associated with an excellent long-term prognosis. The finding that the rate of eGFR decline correlates negatively with proteinuria reduction and positively with residual proteinuria provides further evidence for the pathogenetic role of proteinuria in CKD progression.
 In preclinical studies, atrasentan has protected the kidney in nondiabetic CKD and has also been shown to reduce proteinuria and reduce the risk of progression to ESKD clinically in type 2 diabetics with CKD. In addition, a different ETA antagonist significantly reduced proteinuria, diminished glomerular hypercellularity and prevented the loss of kidney function in a mouse model of IgAN. Further, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo and active controlled study in proteinuric CKD subjects already achieving optimal RAS inhibition, over half of which had biopsy-proven IgAN, selective ETA antagonist sitaxsentan significantly reduced proteinuria and substantially reduced measured GFR and effective filtration fraction, consistent with a reduction in intraglomerular hypertension. In February 2022, the FDA granted accelerated approval to a treatment called Filspari (sparsentan), a dual ARB/endothelin receptor antagonist for adult patients with IgAN at risk of rapid progression. The effect of Filspari on proteinuria was assessed in a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter, global study (PROTECT, NCT03762850) in adults with biopsy-proven IgAN, eGFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and total urine protein ≥r1.0 g/day on a maximized stable dose of RAS inhibitor treatment that was at least 50% of maximum labeled dose. Adjusted geometric mean percent change from baseline in UPCR at week 36 (95% CI) was -45% (-51%, 38%) in the Filspari arm and -15% (-24%, -4%) in the irbesartan control arm. 
 We are investigating atrasentan in IgAN based on the scientific rationale for targeting endothelin signaling, the strong association between high levels of protein excretion in IgAN and kidney function loss, the extent of clinical data demonstrating protein-lowering effects of atrasentan and other endothelin antagonists, the potential for a better tolerated dosing regimen in the IgAN patient population, and the clear unmet medical need for specific therapies to slow disease progression to ESKD.
 Proteinuria as a Surrogate Marker for IgAN
 CKD trials have historically relied on clinical outcomes for the primary endpoint, such as time to first occurrence of doubling of serum creatinine or ESKD (dialysis or transplantation). This generally requires very large trials of long duration, which have proved challenging in IgAN. The Kidney Health Initiative, or KHI, a partnership between the American Society of Nephrology and the FDA launched a project in 2016 to identify surrogate endpoints that could serve as reliable predictors of a treatment’s effect on long-term kidney outcomes in IgAN and be used as a basis for accelerated approval. Surrogate endpoints are used in clinical trials as a substitute for a direct measure of how a patient feels, functions or survives and although they do not measure the clinical benefit of primary interest, they are expected to predict that clinical benefit. The KHI project focused on proteinuria reduction as the most widely recognized and studied risk factor for progression to ESKD in IgAN and found a consistent relationship between the level and duration of proteinuria and loss of kidney function from epidemiologic studies. In addition, trial-level analyses of 13 randomized IgAN clinical trials showed a strong association between treatment effects on percent reduction of proteinuria at approximately nine months (measurements ranged from seven to 12 months) and treatment effects on a composite of time to doubling of serum creatinine, ESKD, or death. The analyses also indicated that the reduction of proteinuria must be sustained to confer protection against 
 15

progressive loss of GFR. The KHI project concluded that proteinuria reduction is a surrogate endpoint reasonably likely to predict a treatment’s effect on progression to ESKD in IgAN. In the United States, surrogate endpoints reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit can be used as a basis for accelerated approval of therapies intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions, such as IgAN. The predicted clinical benefit of products granted accelerated approval must be verified in a post-marketing confirmatory trial.
A meta-analysis of 12 randomized clinical trials in IgAN to compare treatment effects on change in proteinuria to change in eGFR slope provides new evidence supporting the use of early reduction in proteinuria as a surrogate endpoint for studies of CKD progression in IgAN.
 Ongoing Phase 3 ALIGN Trial of Atrasentan for the Treatment of IgAN 
 The ALIGN study, a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of atrasentan in patients with IgAN at risk of progressive loss of kidney function, is designed to evaluate change from baseline in proteinuria and eGFR in 320 patients with IgAN. We have designed the trial in collaboration with a steering committee composed of leading global experts in glomerular diseases and are evaluating atrasentan at 0.75 mg daily, the dose used in the SONAR trial. The primary endpoint of the trial is change from baseline in proteinuria in the first 270 patients at 24 weeks following randomization. The key secondary endpoint is change from baseline in eGFR after all 320 patients have completed approximately two and half years of treatment. This global study is being conducted in over 20 countries on four continents at approximately 170 investigative sites. We initiated the trial in March 2021 and have enrolled over 270 patients to date. The interim proteinuria endpoint analysis will be performed on the first 270 patients enrolled, and we expect to report topline data from this analysis in the second half of 2023 to support potential accelerated approval.
 We have held a Type B End of phase 2 meeting with the FDA to discuss the design of the ALIGN trial and, if the data from the trial are positive, we plan to seek approval of an NDA under the Subpart H accelerated approval pathway in the United States. Additionally, we have also received feedback on the study design from the EMA and the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, or PMDA, in Japan. Based upon this feedback, we believe that upon completion, the ALIGN trial could serve as the basis of a successful marketing authorization application, or MAA, in European countries, Japan, China and other countries.
 At the ERA Congress in June 2022, we announced our two-pronged approach to evaluating atrasentan in combination with SGLT2 inhibitors. Our market research indicates that physician uptake of SGLT2 inhibitors is increasing. In addition, we believe the proteinuria and kidney protection benefits of the ETA receptor antagonist and SGLT2 inhibitor drug classes have the potential to be complementary due to their distinct mechanisms of action, and the diuretic effects of SGLT2 inhibitors may offset the potential fluid retention of atrasentan. Data from a SONAR post-hoc analysis showed that in patients with DKD, six weeks of treatment with atrasentan combined with SGLT2 inhibitors vs. atrasentan alone further decreased albuminuria by 27.6% and decreased body weight, a surrogate for fluid retention, by 1.2 kilograms.
 Due to its low hemodynamic effect and because it is not an immunosuppressive agent, we believe atrasentan is well-positioned to be combined with SGLT2 inhibitors. Therefore, we plan to include a combination stratum of patients who receive atrasentan on top of their stable dose of SGLT2 inhibitor in the ongoing phase 3 ALIGN study. In addition, we plan to initiate a phase 2 study of atrasentan in combination with an SGLT2 inhibitor in patients with IgAN in the first half of 2023.
 We believe our two-pronged approach will enable us to determine whether atrasentan may be combined with SGLT2 inhibitors. We have executed a protocol amendment to the ALIGN trial to enable the enrollment of a stratum of patients who are on a stable dose of an SGLT2 inhibitor. This will allow for a safety and efficacy exploratory analysis of the combination stratum for UPCR at 24 weeks and eGFR at 136 weeks, without any change to our enrollment timelines or the primary analysis for ALIGN. We are also planning to initiate a phase 2 study of atrasentan in combination with SGLT2 inhibitors that will enroll patients with IgAN at high risk for progression despite being on a stable optimized dose of RASi and an SGLT2 inhibitor. Patients will be randomized to placebo or atrasentan, and the primary endpoint will be change in UPCR from baseline to 12 weeks. This study will not be part of our regulatory package for approval of atrasentan, but it will provide additional data to inform potential future use of atrasentan. We plan to initiate this study in the first half of 2023.
 In response to review of the statistical analysis plan for the ALIGN trial, we received correspondence from the FDA in February 2023 recommending that evaluation of the interim proteinuria endpoint analysis for accelerated approval in the ALIGN trial be delayed from week 24 to week 36. The FDA referenced the likelihood that the later timepoint would allow for a greater amount of eGFR data to be evaluated at the time of accelerated approval. We plan to engage with the FDA as soon as possible to discuss their advice. If we shift the interim proteinuria endpoint analysis of the ALIGN trial to 36 weeks, topline proteinuria data would be expected in the fourth quarter of 2023. Therefore, we are updating our timing to report topline proteinuria data from the ALIGN trial to the second half of 2023.

Ongoing Phase 2 AFFINITY Basket Trial for the Treatment of Proteinuric Glomerular Diseases
 In April 2021 we initiated a phase 2 basket study of atrasentan called AFFINITY in several populations of proteinuric glomerular disease patients. Four initial cohorts will include IgAN patients with lower levels of proteinuria (UPCR >0.5g/g <1.0 g/g urine protein/creatinine), FSGS, Alport syndrome, and DKD combined with an SGLT2 inhibitor. Approximately 20 patients are being treated with open-label atrasentan in each cohort. The primary endpoint for each cohort is change in UPCR from baseline to week 12 from two 24-hour urine collections at each time point. 
 We most recently presented interim data from the IgAN patient cohort of the AFFINITY trial in a poster presentation at ASN Kidney Week in November 2022 where atrasentan demonstrated consistent and clinically meaningful proteinuria reductions at weeks six, 12 and 24 of treatment in patients with IgAN already on a maximally tolerated and stable dose of a RAS inhibitor. As of the October 19, 2022 data cutoff, atrasentan demonstrated mean reductions in 24-hour urine protein creatinine ratio, or UPCR, of 38.1% at six weeks of treatment, 48.3% at 12 weeks of treatment and 54.7% at 24 weeks of treatment. After 24 weeks of treatment, 15 of the 19 patients (79%) who had completed this visit had greater than a 40% reduction in proteinuria. Atrasentan was well-tolerated, with no treatment-related serious or severe adverse events. The mean treatment duration was 45 weeks, with time on treatment ranging from 13 to 52 weeks. There were no meaningful changes in blood pressure or acute eGFR effects, suggesting proteinuria reductions were not primarily due to hemodynamic effects of atrasentan. There were no increases in brain natriuretic peptide, or BNP, or mean bodyweight, suggesting minimal fluid retention. 

We plan to present data from additional cohorts of the AFFINITY trial during the second half of 2023.
 BION-1301
 Our second product candidate, BION-1301, is an investigational humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that blocks APRIL binding to its receptors and is being developed as a novel disease-modifying therapy for IgAN. BION-1301 is currently in an ongoing phase 1/2 clinical trial for patients with IgAN and we are preparing to initiate a global phase 3 trial of BION-1301 in mid-2023.
 We believe the key attributes of our BION-1301 product candidate include:
  
• | Early Evidence of Potency. BION-1301, a humanized antibody that blocks APRIL from binding to both its receptors, has been shown in preclinical studies in mice and non-human primates to reduce serum IgA levels, and to reduce IgA as well as Gd-IgA1 levels in healthy volunteers, demonstrating compelling rationale for its use in patients with IgAN.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Novel Mechanism. Blocking APRIL is a distinct approach to reduce circulating levels of IgA and Gd-IgA1, with disease-modifying potential in patients with IgAN.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 17

 
• | Versatility. APRIL is implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple indications including IgAN and other diseases that involve plasma cells.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ease of Manufacture. BION-1301 is a biologic that can be manufactured through well-established processes.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broad Applicability. BION-1301 is a monoclonal antibody, an established therapeutic class to treat cancer as well as autoimmune diseases.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Patients with IgAN have significantly higher levels of APRIL than healthy individuals, and higher APRIL levels in these patients correlate with poor prognosis in the form of increased Gd-IgA1, increased proteinuria and decreased eGFR. We know from published literature that APRIL critically drives IgA class switching, the survival of IgA-producing plasma cells and the secretion of Gd-IgA1 (Hit 1 in the multi-hit pathogenesis of IgAN). Our preclinical experiments demonstrate that blocking APRIL inhibits the survival of and immunoglobulin production by human plasma cells. We have also demonstrated that IgA-producing plasma cells are more sensitive to immunomodulation by BION-1301, with a lesser effect observed on IgG, providing the potential to deplete IgA with BION-1301, while tempering effects on IgG and minimizing the potential for immunosuppression associated with IgG depletion. Blocking APRIL with BION-1301 is a distinct approach to IgAN by reducing circulating levels of Gd-IgA1 which is considered to be the pathogenic variant of IgA in IgAN. We believe BION-1301 represents a novel potential disease-modifying treatment for IgAN.
 Preclinical studies have demonstrated that BION-1301 binds to a specifically defined epitope on APRIL, resulting in complete blockade of APRIL-induced receptor activation. In a preclinical study of BION-1301 in non-human primates, we observed a significant reduction of blood IgA levels and a favorable safety profile. Additional preclinical studies demonstrated that APRIL transgenic mice produce rising levels of IgA as well as IgA deposits in the kidney. Administration of mouse anti-human APRIL was shown to reduce levels of IgA in both the serum and the kidney. In patients with IgAN, BION-1301 has been shown to neutralize 
 18

APRIL and deplete Gd-IgA1, resulting in clinically meaningful reductions in proteinuria. The illustration below shows the potential reduction of Gd-IgA1 in the kidneys by BION-1301 and its effect in IgAN.

In May 2019, we initiated a phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating BION-1301 in healthy volunteers and patients with IgAN. The phase 1/2 multi-center trial evaluated the safety and tolerability of BION-1301 in 63 healthy volunteers in double-blinded, placebo-controlled single-ascending dose, or SAD, and multiple-ascending dose, or MAD, settings. Parts 1 and 2 of this trial in healthy volunteers have been completed. Healthy volunteers in the SAD portion of the study (Part 1) received placebo or a single IV dose of BION-1301 ranging from 10 mg to 1350 mg on day 1. Healthy volunteers in the MAD portion of the study (Part 2) received placebo or IV doses of BION-1301 ranging from 50 mg to 450 mg on days 1, 15 and 29 (three doses total). 
 In healthy volunteers, BION-1301 was well-tolerated, with no significant adverse events, treatment discontinuations or events meeting stopping criteria, across a wide range of doses. Non-neutralizing ADAs occurred in less than 10 percent of subjects with no correlation to dose. The PK profile of BION-1301 was well-behaved, generally dose proportional, and had a half-life of approximately 33 days, suggesting the potential for an extended dosing interval. BION-1301 demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in target engagement as measured by free APRIL levels in serum; over 90 percent target engagement was achieved with a single 450 mg dose. BION-1301 dose-dependently and durably reduced IgA and IgM levels, and to a lesser extent, IgG levels. Approximately 50 to 60 percent reduction in IgA levels was achieved with 150 mg to 450 mg of BION-1301. At all doses tested, IgG levels remained in the normal lab range, thereby providing a PD window to potentially exploit reductions in IgA, while tempering reductions in IgG. BION-
 19

1301 produced dose-dependent reductions in serum Gd-IgA1 levels that were greater in magnitude than reported for total IgA concentrations.
 In addition, a phase 1 IV to SC bioavailability study in healthy volunteers has been completed. In this study, BION-1301 was well-tolerated when administered by both IV and SC routes in healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetic profile of BION-1301 was consistent with previous clinical studies, the absorption rate of BION-1301 was typical of a monoclonal antibody and the magnitude of pharmacodynamic responses were largely retained with SC dosing compared to IV dosing.
 We have completed enrollment of 10 patients with IgAN in Cohort 1 and 30 patients with IgAN in Cohort 2 of Part 3 of the ongoing phase 1/2 trial of BION-1301. We most recently presented interim data from both cohorts at ASN Kidney Week in November 2022. Patients in Cohort 1 started treatment at an intravenous, or IV, BION-1301 dose of 450 mg every two weeks, and after at least 24 weeks of treatment, all patients transitioned to subcutaneous, or SC, dosing at 600 mg every two weeks. In Cohort 2, patients started treatment at a SC BION-1301 dose of 600 mg every two weeks. In both cohorts, patients can receive treatment for up to a total of two years.
 The data presented at ASN demonstrated BION-1301’s disease-modifying potential in IgAN by generating rapid and durable reductions in mechanistic biomarkers and corresponding clinically meaningful proteinuria reductions within three months of initiating treatment, which was consistent across both cohorts. In Cohort 1, reductions in IgA and Gd-IgA1 were maintained beyond 52 weeks of treatment. Reductions in IgM, and to a lesser extent IgG, were also observed. In Cohort 1, BION-1301 demonstrated mean reductions in 24-hour UPCR of 30.4% in seven patients at 12 weeks of treatment, 48.8% in all eight patients at 24 weeks of treatment, 66.9% in all eight patients at 52 weeks of treatment, 67.4% in four patients at 76 weeks of treatment and 71.0% in two patients at 100 weeks of treatment. In Cohort 2, SC BION-1301 treatment resulted in rapid and sustained reductions in IgA and Gd-IgA1, IgM, and to a lesser extent IgG, through 24 weeks of treatment, highly consistent with Cohort 1. BION-1301 also demonstrated mean reductions in 24-hour UPCR of 28.7% in 15 patients at 12 weeks of treatment and 53.8% in 9 patients at 24 weeks of treatment, similar to reductions observed at the same timepoints in Cohort 1. In both cohorts, BION-1301 was well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events or treatment discontinuations due to adverse events and no anti-drug antibodies were observed. 
 
20


Based on the data generated to date in the ongoing phase 1/2 study, we plan to advance BION-1301 into a phase 3 trial with the current Cohort 2 dose of 600 mg SC every two weeks. We have finalized our trial design, are conducting site and country feasibility and pursuing regulatory interactions, with a plan of initiating a global phase 3 trial of BION-1301 in mid-2023. We also have received orphan drug designation for BION-1301 for the treatment of primary IgAN from the European Commission.
 CHK-336
 Our third product candidate is CHK-336, a liver-targeted oral small molecule LDHA inhibitor, which we are developing for the treatment of PH and idiopathic hyperoxaluria. Hyperoxalurias, including PH, are diseases caused by excess oxalate, a potentially toxic metabolite typically filtered by the kidneys and excreted as a waste product in urine. Symptoms of PH include recurrent kidney stones, which when left untreated, can result in kidney failure requiring dialysis or dual kidney/liver transplantation. In patients with hyperoxalurias, excess oxalate combines with calcium to form calcium oxalate crystals that deposit in the kidney, resulting in the formation of painful kidney stones and driving progressive kidney damage over time. PH1, PH2 and PH3 are a group of ultra-rare diseases caused by genetic mutations that result in excess oxalate, and in their most severe forms, can lead to ESKD at a young age. We also believe CHK-336 may have potential in the treatment of patients with idiopathic hyperoxaluria which is more common. Idiopathic hyperoxaluria is an acquired condition, potentially resulting from increased endogenous oxalate overproduction, particularly in association with metabolic diseases. We are currently conducting a phase 1 single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose clinical trial in healthy volunteers evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of CHK-336, and we expect to report initial data from this trial in the first half of 2023. 
 As seen in the illustration below, LDHA catalyzes the terminal step in the production of oxalate from glyoxylate in the liver, therefore LDHA inhibition has the potential to treat all forms of PH – PH1, PH2 and PH3 – as well as other disorders arising from excess oxalate. This is a point of differentiation for CHK-336 since inhibition using small molecules or silencing using small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) of glycolate oxidase (GO), the enzyme involved in the production of glyoxylate from glycolate, is limited to the treatment of PH1 only. An oral, liver-targeted LDHA small molecule inhibitor has the potential for robust efficacy by rapidly 
 21

distributing to the site of oxalate production, while minimizing systemic exposures and potential for off-target activity, to facilitate a favorable tolerability profile required in this chronic disease.
 


With the goal of developing a best-in-class treatment applicable to all types of PH, our research team designed, synthesized and characterized hundreds of LDHA inhibitors to engineer the required properties of potent and selective LDHA inhibition with a liver-targeted tissue-distribution profile. We designed CHK-336 to demonstrate a promising preclinical pharmacokinetic and safety profile. 
 In preclinical studies, CHK-336 has demonstrated tight LDHA binding and a slow enzyme off-rate, potentially extending the duration of action and enabling the potential of a once-daily oral dose in humans. In order to maximize efficacy and reduce the potential for any systemic toxicities as is observed with complete loss-of-function of LDHA, our team engineered into CHK-336 a liver-targeted tissue distribution profile by incorporating moieties that result in liver-selective OATP transporter uptake and simultaneously reducing non-specific passive permeability. 
 22

To evaluate efficacy, we generated a novel mouse model of PH1 using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to delete the AGXT gene responsible for PH1 in humans, which created mice with significantly elevated urinary oxalate excretion compared to normal wild-type (WT) control mice. CHK-336 was dosed orally at three different dose levels, once-daily for seven days and urinary oxalate excretion was compared to a control group of PH mice treated with vehicle. As demonstrated in the figure below, CHK-336 demonstrated significant dose-dependent reductions in urinary oxalate levels, with the majority of CHK-336 treated mice reaching the normal range seen in WT mice.
 

We presented a poster on CHK-336 at ASN Kidney Week 2022, demonstrating preclinical efficacy in PH1 and PH2 mouse models, and the potential for benefit in non-genetic hyperoxalurias caused by oxalate overproduction was also described. We are currently conducting a phase 1 single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose clinical trial in healthy volunteers evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of CHK-336, and we expect to report initial data from this trial in the first half of 2023. Following completion of the phase 1 trial, we will advance CHK-336 towards initiation of phase 2 POC trials for patients with both primary and idiopathic hyperoxalurias. We believe clinical POC for CHK-336 can be achieved efficiently in small studies using urinary oxalate as a validated surrogate biomarker and primary endpoint with the potential for full approval of this program in PH. We have also received rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA for CHK-336 for the treatment of PH.
 Preclinical Product Candidates
 In addition to our lead product candidates, we are also conducting research and discovery efforts to develop a pipeline of product candidates in other rare, severe chronic kidney diseases.
 We have initiated drug discovery programs against promising biological targets across kidney disease indications with high unmet medical need selected in alignment with our guiding precision medicine principles:
  
• | Focus on key pathways driving kidney disease, especially where definitive genetic evidence of a causal, pathogenic role exists;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Design novel, differentiated molecules;
--+----------------------------------------


• | Utilize new and efficient translational approaches to speed research and development; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Execute clinical trials in defined patient populations with rapid, robust endpoints.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our experienced research and discovery team has partnered with academic founders and key opinion leaders to identify targets and utilize novel translational technologies to develop precision medicines for kidney diseases. One of the key challenges in defining molecular mechanisms of kidney disease has been the cellular heterogeneity of the kidney, with nearly 30 distinct cell types arranged in the complex three-dimensional structure of the nephron. This cellular diversity and structure have made it difficult to understand the specific mechanisms associated with loss in kidney function. The recent development of genome-wide single-cell RNA sequencing of cell populations harvested from the kidney presents a new opportunity to dissect molecular mechanisms of kidney function and disease. We utilize single-cell RNA sequencing techniques developed by one of our academic founders to gain high resolution molecular insights into kidney disease mechanisms.
 The cellular heterogeneity of the kidney has historically presented barriers to developing translationally relevant in-vitro cellular models of human kidney diseases. Recently, pluripotent stem cell, or PSC, derived kidney organoids along with patient derived three-dimensional cellular systems have emerged as advanced preclinical models to study kidney disease.

To supplement our internal research efforts, we have entered into a strategic collaboration with Evotec focused on the discovery and development of novel precision medicine therapies for patients with chronic kidney diseases. Based on Evotec’s proprietary comprehensive molecular datasets from thousands of patients across chronic kidney diseases of multiple underlying etiologies, we and Evotec will jointly identify, characterize and validate novel mechanisms and discover precision medicines for lupus nephritis, IgAN, PKD, and other primary glomerular diseases. The collaboration will also involve further characterization of pathways and patient stratification strategies for programs currently in Chinook’s clinical and preclinical pipeline.
 
Gaining access to the NURTuRE cohort study and other proprietary patient biobanks, along with Evotec’s multi-omics integration platform, enables us to characterize the molecular drivers of kidney diseases, identify and validate novel targets and drive patient stratification strategies in kidney disease. With a focus on comprehensive molecular disease classification, combined with prospective clinical outcomes, we believe we have the opportunity to potentially deliver targeted therapies to the right patient populations.
 We believe our research and discovery approach provides significant insights into human disease mechanisms and allows us to select and validate key targets that are central drivers of human kidney diseases.
 License Agreements
 AbbVie
 In December 2019, we entered into an agreement with AbbVie, through its affiliate AbbVie Ireland Unlimited Company for an exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license to atrasentan, along with claims in several issued patents and associated know-how, to manufacture, have manufactured, use and sell defined licensed products for use within the field of all human and non-human diagnostic, prophylactic, and therapeutic uses. Under the terms of this license, we paid an initial licensing fee and issued AbbVie 1,999,415 shares of common stock. The license agreement requires us to pay potential milestone payments totaling up to $135 million upon the achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as royalties ranging from the high single digits to the high teens based on annual thresholds for net sales of licensed products by us, our affiliates and our sublicensees.
 Under the AbbVie license, we have a continuing obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approvals and commercialize licensed products. The license agreement is effective on a per-country basis until the later of: (i) the last expiration of a claim in a licensed patent that covers the licensed product in such country, (ii) the expiration of any period of regulatory exclusivity for a licensed product that bars the entry of generic competitors in such country, or (iii) a specified period after the first commercial sale of the licensed product. Each party has the right to terminate the license for the other party’s material breach or in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency, subject to specified notice and cure periods. Additionally, AbbVie can terminate the license if we challenge claims in licensed patents or fail to meet our diligence obligations with respect to licensed products. Upon any termination of the license, we may grant AbbVie an exclusive, sublicenseable license to any improvements that we make to the licensed technology, including those that we license from third parties, subject to a mutually agreed royalty.
 Manufacturing
 We currently contract with third parties to manufacture our products and anticipate using third parties for our clinical and commercial manufacturing. We do not own or operate facilities for product manufacturing, packaging, storage and distribution, or testing. We have internal personnel and utilize consultants with extensive technical, manufacturing, analytical and quality experience to oversee contract manufacturing and testing activities. We will continue to expand and strengthen our network of third-party providers but may also consider investing in internal manufacturing capabilities in the future if there is a technical need, or a strategic or financial benefit.
 Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose procedural and documentation requirements. At a minimum these regulations govern record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance. Our systems, procedures and contractors are required to be in compliance with these regulations and are assessed through regular monitoring and formal audits.
 Atrasentan. Under our license agreement with AbbVie, we received a substantial amount of drug product and drug substance to support clinical trials of atrasentan. We are resupplying our clinical trials and preparing for future commercial launch with additional manufacturing campaigns conducted by AbbVie. We believe that the synthesis from regulatory starting material to drug substance can be manufactured at scale, resulting in a commercially competitive cost of goods.
 BION-1301. We rely on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to manufacture product for clinical use based on engineered cell lines that express and secrete the antibody product candidate. We have contracted with several CMOs to develop, produce and release drug substance and drug product for use in the ongoing phase 1/2 clinical trial and the upcoming phase 3 
 24

clinical trial. We expect to continue to rely on CMOs for further manufacturing of BION-1301, including the development and manufacturing of alternative formulations.
 CHK-336. In 2022, we continued manufacturing activities for CHK-336 to support the initiation of our healthy volunteer study of CHK-336 and expect to continue to rely on CMOs for further manufacturing of CHK-336.
 Sales and Marketing
 We do not currently have sales and marketing infrastructure to support commercial launch of our products. We intend to build such capabilities in North America prior to launch of atrasentan. Outside of North America, we may rely on licensing, co-sale and co-promotion agreements with strategic partners for the commercialization of our products, including the recently formed joint venture, SanReno Therapeutics, in East Asia. If we build a commercial infrastructure to support marketing in North America, such commercial infrastructure could be expected to include a targeted sales force supported by sales management, internal sales support, an internal marketing group and distribution support. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure internally, we would have to invest financial and management resources, some of which would have to be deployed prior to any confirmation that atrasentan will be approved.
Coverage & Reimbursement
 The regulations that govern pricing and reimbursement for new drugs vary widely from country to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription biopharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, a drug company can obtain regulatory approval for a product in a country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay commercial launch of that product.
 A drug company’s ability to successfully commercialize any products will also depend on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products will be available from government authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Even if one or more products are successfully brought to the market, these products may not be considered cost effective, and the amount reimbursed for such products may be insufficient to allow them to be sold on a competitive basis. Third-party payors who reimburse patients or healthcare providers, such as government plans, are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are seeking to reduce the prices charged or the amounts reimbursed for biopharmaceutical products.
 Significant delays can occur in obtaining reimbursement for newly-approved drugs or therapeutic biologics, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug or therapeutic biologic is approved by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that covers a drug company’s costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution.
 Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also be insufficient to cover a drug company’s costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may be based on payments allowed for lower cost drugs or therapeutic biologics that are already reimbursed, may be incorporated into existing payments for other services and may reflect budgetary constraints or imperfections in Medicare data. Net prices for drugs or therapeutic biologics may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs or therapeutic biologics from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Further, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.
 Competition
 The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition and vigorous defense of intellectual property. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing and future new therapies. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions.
 If our lead product candidate atrasentan is approved for the treatment of IgAN, it may compete with other products used to treat this disease. To our knowledge, there are only two FDA-approved drugs for IgAN, the corticosteroid treatment Tarpeyo (budesonide) from Calliditas Therapeutics AB and Filspari (sparsentan), a dual ARB/endothelin receptor antagonist from Travere Therapeutics, 
 25

Inc., but there are a variety of additional treatments utilized, including RASis, steroids, chemotherapy drugs and immunomodulatory approaches. In addition, there are a number of competitors in clinical development for the treatment of IgAN at a similar stage of development or more advanced than us, including Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., AstraZeneca PLC, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., Novartis AG, Omeros Corporation, Vera Therapeutics, RemeGen, Alpine Immune Sciences, Inc. and Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
Many of our potential competitors, alone or with strategic partners, may have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than we do, such as larger research and development, clinical, marketing and manufacturing organizations. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance, rendering our treatments obsolete or non-competitive. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or less expensive than any product candidates that we may develop. In geographies that are critical to our commercial success, competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our products, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market, if ever. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience and availability of reimbursement. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic drugs.
 Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including obtaining, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. Our patent portfolio, including in-licensed patents and patent applications, is intended to cover, but is not limited to, our technology platforms, product candidates and components thereof, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, and any other inventions that are commercially important to our business. We also rely on trade secret protection of our confidential information and know-how relating to our proprietary technology, platforms and product candidates, continuing innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our position in our platform and product candidates. Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned or controlled by third parties; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including our patents; to defend against challenges and assertions by third parties of their purported intellectual property rights; and to operate without infringement of valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.
 With respect to atrasentan, we have exclusively licensed issued U.S. and foreign patents and pending U.S. and foreign patent applications that cover formulations and methods of use related directly to atrasentan from AbbVie. These exclusively licensed patents included seven issued U.S. patents, one issued foreign patent and four pending foreign patent applications. These patents, and any patents that issue from the pending applications, that we have licensed from AbbVie are anticipated to expire between 2028 and 2034, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 Separately, we have filed U.S. and foreign patent applications with claims that are intended to cover additional methods of treatment and combinations of atrasentan with other therapies in kidney disease. We have one issued U.S. patent relating to methods of treatment with atrasentan. This patent, and any patents that may issue from these currently pending patent applications, which include PCT international applications, U.S. patent applications, and foreign patent applications, are expected to expire in 2040, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 With respect to BION-1301, we have seven issued U.S. patents, twenty-four issued foreign patents (not including European country validations), at least twenty pending U.S. and foreign patent applications, that cover the composition of matter of BION-1301, as well as methods of use. These patents, and any patents that issue from the pending applications are anticipated to expire between 2030 and 2041, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 With respect to CHK-336, we have in-licensed issued U.S. and foreign patents and have filed U.S. and foreign patent applications with claims that cover the composition of matter of CHK-336 and other related compounds, as well as methods of use. As 
 26

of December 31, 2022, any patents that may issue from these currently pending patent applications, which include PCT international applications, U.S. patent applications, and foreign patent applications, are expected to expire between 2035 and 2041, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the laws of the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing of a non-provisional patent application. However, the term of United States patents may be extended for delays incurred due to compliance with the FDA requirements or by delays encountered during prosecution that are caused by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO. For example, for drugs that are regulated by the FDA under the Hatch-Waxman Act, it is permitted to extend the term of a patent that covers such drug for up to five years beyond the normal expiration date of the patent. For more information on patent term extensions, see “—Government regulation—The Hatch-Waxman Act—Patent term extension.” In the future, if and when our biopharmaceutical product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those product candidates. We intend to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the USPTO and FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. Our currently issued patents will likely expire on dates ranging from 2028 to 2041, unless we receive patent term extension. If patents are issued on our pending patent applications, the resulting patents are projected to expire on dates ranging from 2036 to 2041, unless we receive patent term extension or patent term adjustment, or both. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, specific claims issues, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
 The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. The patent situation outside of the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in the patent laws and rules, either by legislation, judicial decisions, or regulatory interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights, and more generally could affect the value of our intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, importing or otherwise commercializing any of our patented inventions, either directly or indirectly, will depend in part on our success in obtaining, defending and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions, and improvements. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our platform and product candidates and the methods used to manufacture them. Moreover, our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our platform’s product candidates. The area of patent and other intellectual property rights in biotechnology is an evolving one with many risks and uncertainties, and third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology. The USPTO and FDA are currently collaborating regarding the patent prosecution practice for biotechnology patents. The outcome of that collaboration may impact biotechnology patent assets, including ours. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may be challenged, narrowed, circumvented or invalidated, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related platforms or product candidates or limit the length of the term of patent protection that we may have for our product candidates. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or third parties may seek to develop our clinical candidates in countries where we do not have patent protection. This risk may also affect our ability to partner rights in those countries. For these reasons, we may have competition for our product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that before any product candidate can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent. For this and other risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms and product candidates, please see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 We have filed for trademark protection of the “Chinook Therapeutics” mark with the USPTO and foreign trademark registries. We intend to register and maintain the trademark “Chinook Therapeutics” in the USPTO and in numerous other jurisdictions, including, but not limited to, the European Union (EU), China, India, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, or UK, and Canada.
 We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Although we take steps to protect our confidential and proprietary information as trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements under the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential 
 27

and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property. In many cases our confidentiality and other agreements with consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors require them to assign or grant us licenses to inventions they invent as a result of the work or services they render under such agreements or grant us an option to negotiate a license to use such inventions. Despite these efforts, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed, and any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches.
 We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. To the extent that our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators and advisors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in relation to the resulting know-how or inventions. For more information, please see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
FDA Approval Process
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Pharmaceutical products—such as small molecule drugs and biological products, or biologics—used for the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of a human being—are subject to regulation under the FD&C Act, with the exception that the section of the FD&C Act which governs the approval of drugs via New Drug Applications, or NDAs, does not apply to the approval of biologics. In contrast, biologics are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, via a Biologics License Application, or BLA. However, the application process and requirements for approval of BLAs are very similar to those for NDAs. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical hold, FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
 Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 28

The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, and ethics committee for approval. The IRB will also monitor the clinical trial until completed. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated checkpoints based on access to certain data from the trial.
 Clinical trials to support NDAs and BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a drug demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in phase 2 evaluations, phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug or biologic and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug or biologic. In most cases the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug or biologic. A single phase 3 trial may be sufficient in rare instances, including (1) where the trial is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible or (2) when in conjunction with other confirmatory evidence.
 The manufacturer of an investigational drug or biologic in a phase 2 or 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access to such investigational drug or biologic.
 After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA or BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA or BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA or BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls.
 The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA or BLA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs or BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently exceeding $3,200,000 for Fiscal Year 2023 for an application containing clinical data. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs or BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. The applicant under an approved NDA or BLA is also subject to annual program fees, currently exceeding $390,000 for each prescription product. The FDA adjusts the user fees on an annual basis, and the fees typically increase annually.
 The FDA reviews each submitted NDA or BLA before it determines whether to file it and may request additional information. The FDA must make a decision on whether to file an NDA or BLA within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. Once the submission is filed, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA or BLA. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs or BLAs. Most applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within ten to twelve months; most applications for priority review drugs or biologics are reviewed in six to eight months. Priority review can be applied to drugs or biologics that the FDA determines may offer significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to marketed products or where no adequate therapy exists. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. The FDA does not always meet its goal dates for standard and priority NDAs or BLAs, and the review process can be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug and biologic products, or drug and biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an outside advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
 Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also typically inspects clinical trial sites to ensure compliance with GCP requirements and the integrity of the data supporting safety and efficacy.
 29

After the FDA evaluates the NDA or BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter, or CRL, generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application, such as additional clinical data, additional pivotal clinical trial(s), and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may resubmit the NDA or BLA addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, withdraw the application, engage in formal dispute resolution or request an opportunity for a hearing. The FDA has committed to reviewing resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
 If, or when, the deficiencies identified in the CRL have been addressed to FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA or BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA or BLA approval, the FDA may require a REMS to help ensure that the benefits of the drug or biologic outweigh the potential risks to patients. A REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug or biologic. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the drug or biologic. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of an NDA or BLA supplement or, in some case, a new NDA or BLA, before the change can be implemented. An NDA or BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA and BLA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs and BLAs.
 Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs and biologics that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition.
Fast Track Designation
 Fast track designation may be granted for a product that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. The sponsor of an investigational drug product may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug concurrent with, or after, the submission of the IND for the product candidate. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s NDA or BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. At the time of NDA or BLA filing, the FDA will determine whether to grant priority review designation. Additionally, fast track designation may be withdrawn if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Accelerated Approval
 Accelerated approval may be granted for a product that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and that generally provides a meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments. A product eligible for accelerated approval may be approved on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on 
 30

irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long, and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. The accelerated approval pathway is contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. These confirmatory trials must be completed with due diligence and, in some cases, the FDA may require that the trial be designed, initiated, and/or fully enrolled prior to approval. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the product from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. The Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act, or FDORA, was recently enacted, which included provisions related to the accelerated approval pathway. Pursuant to FDORA, the FDA is authorized to require a post-approval study to be underway prior to approval or within a specified time period following approval. FDORA also requires the FDA to specify conditions of any required post-approval study, which may include milestones such as a target date of study completion and requires sponsors to submit progress reports for required post-approval studies and any conditions required by the FDA not later than 180 days following approval and not less frequently than every 180 days thereafter until completion or termination of the study. FDORA enables the FDA to initiate criminal prosecutions for the failure to conduct with due diligence a required post-approval study, including a failure to meet any required conditions specified by the FDA or to submit timely reports.
 Orphan Drugs
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States but for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States.
 Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the drug or biologic and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 The first NDA or BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active moiety to treat a rare disease for which it has such designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biologic for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or in instances of drug supply issues. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Other benefits of orphan drug designation include tax credits for certain research and an exemption from the NDA user fee.
 Pediatric Information
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or BLAs or supplements to NDAs or BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biologic for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug or biologic is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug or biologic for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted, with certain exceptions.
 The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides NDA or BLA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity—patent or nonpatent—for a drug, and nonpatent for a biologic, if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug or biologic in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.
 Rare Pediatric Disease Vouchers
 The Rare Pediatric Disease Voucher Program is intended to encourage development of new drug and biological products for prevention and treatment of certain rare pediatric diseases. Although there are existing incentive programs to encourage the development and study of drugs and biologics for rare diseases, pediatric populations, and unmet medical needs, this program provides an additional incentive for the development of drugs and biologics for rare pediatric diseases, which may be used alone or in combination with other incentive programs. A rare pediatric disease is defined as a disease that is a serious or life-threatening disease 
 31

in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years, including age groups often called neonates, infants, children, and adolescents; and is a rare disease or condition as defined in the FD&C Act, which includes diseases and conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States and diseases and conditions that affect a larger number of persons and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the costs of developing and making available the product in the United States can be recovered from sales of the product in the United States.
 The sponsor of a human drug application for a rare pediatric disease drug or biologic product may be eligible for a voucher that can be used (or sold) to obtain a priority review for a subsequent human drug application submitted under section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act or section 351 of the PHS Act after the date of approval of the rare pediatric disease drug product. The rare pediatric disease priority review voucher program was most recently re-authorized by Congress in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, extending the rare pediatric disease program through September 30, 2024, with the potential for priority review vouchers to be granted through September 30, 2026.
 Additional Controls for Biologics
 To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHS Act also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend biologics licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases within the United States. 
 After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the lot manufacturing history and the results of all of the manufacturer's tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before allowing the manufacturer to release the lots for distribution. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. As with drugs, after approval of a BLA, biologics manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval.  
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Once an NDA or BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs and biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs and biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in a manner consistent with the approved labeling.
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following FDA approval of an NDA or BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, manufacturing, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug and biologic manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the Agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
 The Hatch-Waxman Amendments
 Orange Book Listing
 Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch Waxman Amendments, NDA applicants are required to identify to the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s drug or approved method of using the drug. Upon approval of a drug, the applicant must update its listing of patents to the NDA in timely fashion and each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book.
 32

Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredient(s), strength, route of administration, and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. An approved ANDA product is considered to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, pre-clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved under the ANDA pathway are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug pursuant to each state’s laws on drug substitution.
 The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents identified for the reference listed drug in the Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify to each patent in one of the following ways: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. For patents listed that claim an approved method of use, under certain circumstances the ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents through a Paragraph IV certification, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA-holder and patentee(s) once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA (referred to as the “notice letter”). The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice letter. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months from the date the notice letter is received, expiration of the patent, the date of a settlement order or consent decree signed and entered by the court stating that the patent that is the subject of the certification is invalid or not infringed, or a decision in the patent case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. In some instances, an ANDA applicant may receive approval prior to expiration of certain non-patent exclusivity if the applicant seeks, and the FDA permits, the omission of such exclusivity-protected information from the ANDA prescribing information.
 Drug Exclusivity
 Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA cannot receive any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug unless the application contains a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the application may be submitted one year prior to expiration of the NCE exclusivity. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA for a generic version of the drug may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period.
 Certain changes to an approved drug, such as the approval of a new indication, the approval of a new strength, and the approval of a new condition of use, are associated with a three-year period of exclusivity from the date of approval during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA for a generic drug that includes the change. In some instances, an ANDA applicant may receive approval prior to expiration of the three-year exclusivity if the applicant seeks, and the FDA permits, the omission of such exclusivity-protected information from the ANDA package insert.
 Patent Term Extension
 The Hatch Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. Patent term extension, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for the extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase (the time between IND application and NDA submission) and all of the review phase (the time between NDA submission and approval) up to a maximum of five years. The time can be reduced for any time the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence.
 The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. However, the USPTO may not grant an extension because of, for example, failing to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than requested.
 33

The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years, and only one patent per product can be extended. The application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent, and for patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the USPTO must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.
 Biologic Exclusivity
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be “biosimilar” or “interchangeable” with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity sufficient to reference a prior FDA-licensed product requires that there be no differences in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and at least one clinical study, absent a waiver from the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In order to meet the higher hurdle of interchangeability, a sponsor must demonstrate that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product, and for a product that is administered more than once, that the risk of switching between the reference product and biosimilar product is not greater than the risk of maintaining the patient on the reference product. The first biosimilar product was approved under the BPCIA in 2015, and the first interchangeable product was approved in 2021. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being evaluated by the FDA. A reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product and no application for a biosimilar can be submitted for four years from the date of licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against a finding of interchangeability for other biologics for the same condition of use for the lesser of (i) one year after first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar, (ii) eighteen months after the first interchangeable biosimilar is approved if there is not patent challenge, (iii) eighteen months after resolution of a lawsuit over the patents of the reference biologic in favor of the first interchangeable biosimilar applicant, or (iv) 42 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar’s application has been approved if a patent lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
Other Healthcare Laws
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain general business and marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes and other healthcare laws and regulations.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting or receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others, on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation.
 Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. This includes claims made to programs where the federal government reimburses, such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as programs where the federal government is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Additionally, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Most states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and civil False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 34

Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the civil monetary penalties statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offeror or payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order a receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular supplier, and the additional federal criminal statutes created by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises of any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation.
 Further, pursuant to the ACA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, has issued a final rule that requires manufacturers of prescription drugs or biologics to collect and report information on certain payments or transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), physician assistants, certain types of advance practice nurses and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The reported data is made available in searchable form on a public website on an annual basis. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. 
 In addition, several states now require prescription drug and biologic companies to report certain expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug or biologic products and to report gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states. Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. Some states require the reporting of certain drug or biologic pricing information, including information pertaining to and justifying price increases. In addition, certain states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Certain states and local jurisdictions also require the registration of pharmaceutical sales and medical representatives. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties.
 Efforts to ensure that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations involve substantial costs. If a drug company’s operations are found to be in violation of any such requirements, it may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of its operations, loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA, exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other federal or state government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, imprisonment, and reputational harm. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action for an alleged or suspected violation can cause a drug company to incur significant legal expenses and divert management’s attention from the operation of the business, even if such action is successfully defended.
 U.S. Healthcare Reform
 Healthcare reforms that have been adopted, and that may be adopted in the future, could result in further reductions in coverage and levels of reimbursement for pharmaceutical products, increases in rebates payable under U.S. government rebate programs and additional downward pressure on pharmaceutical product prices. On September 9, 2021, the Biden administration published a wide-ranging list of policy proposals, most of which would need to be carried out by Congress, to reduce drug prices and drug payment. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, plan includes, among other reform measures, proposals to lower prescription drug prices, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate prices and disincentivizing price increases, and to support market changes that strengthen supply chains, promote biosimilars and generic drugs, and increase price transparency. These initiatives recently culminated in the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, in August 2022, which will, among other things, allow HHS to negotiate the selling price of certain drugs and biologics that CMS reimburses under Medicare Part B and Part D, although only high-expenditure single-source drugs that have been approved for at least 7 years (11 years for biologics) can be selected by CMS for negotiation. Because the negotiated price takes effect two years after the selection year, no drug or biologic will be subject to a negotiated price prior to 9 or 13 years after approval, respectively. The negotiated prices, which will first become effective in 2026, will be capped at a statutory ceiling price. Beginning in October 2023, the IRA will also penalize drug manufacturers that increase prices of Medicare Part B and Part D drugs at a rate greater than the rate of inflation. The IRA permits the Secretary of HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties. The IRA also extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. 
 35

Data Privacy & Security Laws
 Numerous local, state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of personal information, including health-related information. In the United States, numerous local, federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. For example, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, imposes privacy, security and breach notification obligations on certain health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving creating, receiving, maintaining or transmitting individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of such covered entities.
 Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or the FTCA, 15 U.S.C § 45(a). The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards.
 In addition, certain state and non-U.S. laws, notably the California’s Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, or PIPEDA, govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. For example, the CPRA, which went into effect January 1, 2023, provides for among other things, new data privacy obligations for covered companies and new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of disclosure and sale of their information. The CPRA also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches of personal information, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. Colorado, Utah, Connecticut and Virginia have also recently enacted comparable consumer privacy regimes that have and will take effect in 2023, and as of January 2023, four states (Michigan, Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania) have active bills under review relating to consumer privacy. In Europe, the GDPR went into effect in May 2018 and introduced strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the European Economic Area, or EEA. In addition, the GDPR increases the scrutiny of transfers of personal data from clinical trial sites located in the EEA to the United States and other jurisdictions that the European Commission does not recognize as having “adequate” data protection laws, and imposes substantial fines for breaches and violations. In Canada, PIPEDA and similar provincial laws impose obligations on companies with respect to processing personal information, including health-related information. PIPEDA requires companies to obtain an individual’s consent when collecting, using or disclosing that individual’s personal information. Individuals in certain jurisdictions have the right to access and correct the accuracy of their personal information held by an organization, and personal information may only be used for the purposes for which it was collected. If an organization intends to use personal information for another purpose, it must give notice of the new use, and in certain circumstances, again obtain that individual’s consent. Failure to comply with PIPEDA could result in significant fines and penalties.
 Domestic laws in all 50 states have laws requiring businesses to provide notice to customers, in certain circumstances whose personally identifiable information was been disclosed as a result of unauthorized access or data breach, in addition to requirements under foreign and federal laws. The laws and respective regulations are not consistent and frequently amended.
