Our Business
 We are a clinical-stage immuno-oncology (“I-O”) company advancing an extensive pipeline of immune checkpoint antibodies, adoptive cell therapies and neoantigen cancer vaccines, to fight cancer. Our business is designed to drive success in I-O through speed, innovation and effective combination therapies. We believe that a deep understanding of each patient’s cancer and the potential to deliver combination therapies will drive substantial expansion of the patient population benefiting from current I-O therapies. In addition to a diverse pipeline, we have assembled fully integrated end-to-end capabilities including novel target discovery, antibody generation, cell line development and current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) manufacturing. We believe that these fully integrated capabilities enable us to produce novel candidates on timelines that are shorter than the industry standard. Leveraging our science and capabilities, we have forged important partnerships to advance our innovation.  
 We believe the next generation of cancer treatment will build on clinically validated antibodies targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1 combined with novel immunomodulatory agents designed to address underlying tumor escape mechanisms. Our most advanced antibody candidates are balstilimab (an anti-PD-1 antibody) and zalifrelimab (an anti-CTLA-4 antibody), which are currently in Phase 2 trials as both a monotherapy (balstilimab) and combination therapy (balstilimab/zalifrelimab) for treatment of patients with second-line cervical cancer. Both trials are designed to support Biologics License Application (“BLA”) filings under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) accelerated approval pathway. We announced interim data from these trials in February, March and September 2020, and initiated the rolling submission of a BLA for balstilimab (monotherapy) in September 2020. We expect to complete our BLA filing for balstilimab (monotherapy) in the first half of 2021, and to solidify our strategy for the combination filing after the monotherapy filing is accepted by the FDA. We are also advancing a proprietary next-generation anti-CTLA-4 antibody, AGEN1181, which is designed to improve the magnitude of responses to first-generation anti-CTLA-4 molecules and to expand the population of patients currently benefiting from anti-CTLA-4 therapy. AGEN1181 is currently in a Phase 2 study as a monotherapy and as a combination therapy with balstilimab.         
 In addition to our lead programs, Agenus scientists have leveraged our internal discovery and translational platforms and powerful algorithms to develop a pipeline of molecules that are intended to address key aspects of antitumor immunity and tumor resistance mechanisms. For tumors not yet visible to the immune system, we are leveraging our immune educating neoantigen vaccine platform, designed to target mutationally based and biochemically based (phosphorylated) neoantigens (AutoSynVax and PhosphoSynVax) to prime the immune system to attack tumors. These vaccines may be applicable to patients where checkpoint modulating (“CPM”) antibodies alone are not sufficient to elicit tumor control. In addition, and to further improve patient response rates, Agenus scientists are developing therapies intended to address mechanisms of immune evasion and therapeutic resistance. These approaches include “multi-specific” antibodies designed to modulate myeloid cell biology, condition the tumor microenvironment, and augment the activity of immune cells. Some of these novel agents are advancing to the clinic via the Agenus pipeline or via partnering relationships. Given the diversity of the Agenus pipeline, we are positioned to potentially deliver combination therapies with our goal being to enhance response rates and thereby benefit patients who are unresponsive to current immunotherapies. 
 Additionally, in 2017, we formed a subsidiary, AgenTus Therapeutics, focused on the development of allogeneic invariant natural killer T (“iNKT”) cell therapies to treat cancer and other life threatening illnesses, as well as a pipeline of T cell receptors (“TCR”) and chimeric antigen receptors (“CAR”) formulated in allogeneic cell formats.  In May 2020 and June 2020, the FDA accepted our investigational new drug (“IND”) applications for agenT-797, an allogeneic iNKT therapy, for the treatment of patients with hematological malignancies, including multiple myeloma and B cell lymphoma, and COVID-19-related pneumonia, respectively. In November 2020, AgenTus dosed its first COVID-19 patient with agenT-797, and trials for hematological malignancies are expected to commence in the second quarter of 2021.
 To succeed in I-O, innovation and speed are paramount. We are a vertically integrated biotechnology company equipped with a suite of technology platforms to advance from novel target identification through manufacturing for clinical trials of antibodies and vaccines.
 Our common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “AGEN.”
 
Our Vision
 We believe that combination therapies and a deep understanding of each patient’s cancer will be key drivers of success in substantially expanding the patient population benefiting from current I-O therapies. In addition, delivering innovation with speed is critical for our future success, as drug development timelines in oncology shorten while product obsolescence rates climb. We believe our fully integrated, end-to-end capabilities from novel target discovery, antibody generation, cell line development, to cGMP manufacturing, together with a comprehensive portfolio consisting of antibody-based therapeutics, cell therapies, adjuvants and cancer vaccines, will uniquely position us to produce novel therapies on accelerated timelines. We believe that a balanced pipeline of product candidates should focus on both validated targets as well as novel targets designed to address tumor escape mechanisms. In this 
 3
 
context, CTLA-4 and PD-1 antagonists are recognized as the first clinically validated immunotherapy combination. These therapeutic targets, in combination with innovative immunomodulatory antibodies or immune education vaccines, are reasonably anticipated to be focal points of the next generation of I-O combination therapies. Therefore, we plan to develop, register and launch proprietary antibodies targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4 aggressively through the clinic and expand with novel combination therapies designed to improve clinical response and the durability of response of existing therapies.
 Our Strategy
 Our strategy is to bring innovative combination therapies for cancer patients to substantially expand the patient population benefiting from current I-O therapies. Our diverse pipeline of antibody-based therapeutics, cell therapies, adjuvants and cancer vaccines enable us to pursue therapeutically relevant approaches focused on safe and effective therapeutic agent combinations. In line with this approach, we utilize a tiered risk profile with targeting of compressed timelines for regulatory filings; as exemplified by the initiation of a rolling BLA submission for balstilimab monotherapy in 2020 – to support accelerated approval of balstilimab in the treatment of second-line cervical cancer. We believe that we are positioned to take advantage of accelerated pathways for product approvals which require relatively small numbers of patients and utilize surrogate or short-term endpoints to support trial outcomes. In addition, we plan to pursue additional select indications to further expedite market entry. 
 Our strategies for our more novel, earlier stage development programs include (i) pursuit of effective I-O antibodies, allogeneic cell-therapy combinations with CTLA-4 and/or PD-1 targeted antibodies as the backbone and (ii) advancement of our differentiated clinical stage antibody programs such as our next generation anti-CTLA-4 (AGEN1181), our bispecific programs (AGEN1223 and others), differentiated CD137 (AGEN2373) and TIGIT antibodies. 
 Part of our strategy is to develop and commercialize some select product candidates by continuing our existing arrangements with collaborators and licensees and by entering into new collaborations.
 Our Assets
 Our I-O assets include antibody-based therapeutics, monospecific and bispecific antibodies, cell therapy, neoantigen cancer vaccines (individualized and off-the shelf) platforms and adjuvants. Our proprietary and differentiated anti-PD-1 antibody and our first-generation and next generation anti-CTLA-4 antagonists are in clinical development; we believe we have the most advanced clinical stage proprietary anti-CTLA-4 (zalifrelimab) and anti-PD-1 antibody clinical combinations under evaluation.  
 To complement our most advanced balstilimab and zalifrelimab programs, we and our partners are advancing additional clinical-stage assets as follows: 
  
• | AGENT 797 – iNKT cells manufactured from human donors in a Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of COVID-19-related pneumonia; a Phase 1 clinical trial expected to initiate in the second quarter of 2021 for the treatment of Multiple Myeloma / B Cell Malignancies; and clinical trials for combination therapies to treat solid tumors are planned for mid-2021, all through our AgenTus subsidiary.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AGEN1181 – a next-generation anti-CTLA-4 monospecific antibody currently in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial being advanced by Agenus as a monotherapy and in combination with balstilimab;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AGEN2373 – an anti-CD137 monospecific antibody currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial being advanced by Agenus, and which Gilead Sciences, Inc. (“Gilead”) has an option to license exclusively;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AGEN1223 – a novel bispecific antibody designed to deplete regulatory T cells currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial being advanced by Agenus, and which Gilead has an option to license exclusively;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AGEN1423 – a tumor microenvironment conditioning anti-CD73/TGFβ TRAP bifunctional antibody that recently completed a Phase 1 clinical trial sponsored by Gilead;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | MK-4830 – a monospecific antibody targeting ILT4 exclusively licensed to Merck Sharpe & Dohme (“Merck”) and being advanced by Merck in a Phase 2 clinical trial.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | INCAGN1876 – an anti-GITR monospecific antibody exclusively licensed to Incyte Corporation (“Incyte”) and being advanced by Incyte in a Phase 2 clinical trial;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | INCAGN1949 – an anti-OX40 monospecific antibody exclusively licensed to Incyte and being advanced by Incyte in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | INCAGN2390 – an anti-TIM-3 monospecific antibody exclusively licensed to Incyte and being advanced by Incyte in a Phase 1 clinical trial; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | INCAGN2385 – an anti-LAG-3 monospecific antibody exclusively licensed to Incyte and being advanced by Incyte in a Phase 1 clinical trial.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We also have a robust pipeline of pre-clinical assets, which include AGEN1777, an anti-TIGIT bispecific antibody, and AGEN1327, an anti-TIGIT monospecific antibody. We expect to initiate clinical trials with AGEN1777 in 2021.
 Further, our neoantigen vaccine platforms include: (i) individualized AutoSynVax™ (ASV™), which targets the unique antigens expressed by a patient’s own tumor, and (ii) off-the-shelf (or pre-manufactured) PhosphoSynVax™ (PSV™), which target 
 4
 
antigens expressed across patients and tumors, thereby enabling potential treatment of broader categories of patients. Our vaccines are powered by our proprietary adjuvant, QS-21 StimulonTM; and have demonstrated safety in Phase 1 clinical trials. We believe our vaccines will be an important part of a durable memory responses in tumor control and treatment,and are well-positioned to be optimized for use in combination with antibodies and cell therapeutic platforms.
 Our proprietary QS-21 Stimulon is considered to be one of the most potent adjuvants known. By way of example, QS-21 Stimulon is a key component in several GlaxoSmithKline plc (“GSK”) vaccines, including GSK’s Shingrix, which reported sales in excess of $2.0 billion in each of 2019 and 2020, its first two years on the market. Sales in 2019 triggered a $15.1 million milestone payment to us from Healthcare Royalty Partners III, L.P. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “HCR”), which we received in 2020. QS-21 is used in numerous other clinical-stage vaccines under development, including our own cancer vaccines. In addition, in 2019, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation awarded us a grant to develop an alternative, plant cell culture-based manufacturing process to ensure continuous future supplies of QS-21 Stimulon, which we are pursuing in partnership with Phyton Biotech. 
 Our Antibody Discovery Platforms and CPM Programs
 Checkpoint antibodies regulate immune response against tumor expressing antigens and are achieving positive outcomes in a number of cancers that were considered untreatable only a few years ago. Two classes of checkpoint targets include:

1. | inhibitory checkpoints that help suppress an immune response in order to prevent excessive immune reaction resulting in undesired inflammation and/or auto-immunity; and
2. | stimulatory checkpoints that can enhance or amplify an antigen-specific immune response. 

 We possess end-to-end capabilities in-house – from discovery through to manufacturing – that have enabled us to advance our discoveries at lower costs with efficiency and speed. These product development advantages allow us to manage a large portfolio of discoveries; and have given rise to clinical stage antibody candidates, and a portfolio of more than a dozen pre-clinical programs advancing, and partnerships (i.e., with Gilead, Incyte, Merck, GSK and Betta Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. (“Betta”)).  
 Our anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 programs (zalifrelimab and balstilimab, respectively) are in late phase clinical trials designed to support BLA filings under the FDA accelerated approval pathway. We initiated the rolling submission of our BLA for balstilimab monotherapy in September 2020 to treat second-line cervical cancer patients. We expect to complete this BLA filing in the first half of 2021, and to solidify our strategy for the combination filing in the same indication after the monotherapy filing is accepted by the FDA. We presented data from our pre-planned interim analysis in February, March, and September 2020, as well as at major oncology conferences, including the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (“SITC”) in 2019, American Society of Clinical Oncology conference in June 2018 and the European Society for Medical Oncology congress in 2018.  In addition, we presented pre-clinical data on our Fc engineered anti-TIGIT antibody at the SITC conference in 2019, our Gilead-partnered anti-CD137 (AGEN2373), and our Incyte-partnered programs (anti-TIM-3 and anti-LAG-3) antibodies at the American Association for Cancer Research conference in April 2018.
 To date, we have treated over 400 patients with zalifrelimab (anti-CTLA-4) and/or balstilimab (anti-PD-1) and have observed a safety profile consistent with this class of drugs.
 Over the past six months, we have reported the following clinical data:
  
• | Results from the largest clinical trials of I-O agents in relapsed cervical cancer revealed in n=160 patient balstilimab (anti-PD-1 antibody) monotherapy trial achieved response rates of 14% in all treated patients and 19% in PD-L1 positive patients, and in a trial of n=155 patient balstilimab (anti-PD-1 antibody) + zalifrelimab (anti-CTLA-4 antibody) combination trial achieved response rates of 22% in all patients and 27% in PD-L1 positive patients;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Six clinical responses in a Phase 1/2 trial of AGEN1181, as monotherapy and in combination with Agenus’ anti-PD-1 balstilimab. These results demonstrate potential for AGEN1181 as an efficacious next-generation CTLA-4 antibody (with activity in difficult-to-treat tumors) without neuroendocrine or significant liver toxicities commonly observed with the currently approved CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab. Responses (2 complete responses; 4 partial responses) were observed in MSS endometrial (n=2), PD-1 refractory ovarian (n=2), and colorectal (n=2) tumor types. We also presented on the first-ever report of intratumoral Treg depletion with a CTLA-4 antibody in clinical trials at SITC 2020; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Positive preliminary results from a Phase 1 trial of iNKT cell therapy in patients with moderate to severe symptoms of COVID-19 reporting of the 4 patients dosed at the time of report, 3 patients (75%) were extubated and released after treatment; with 2 patients (50%) being extubated within 24 hours of dosing; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | New clinical responses and novel biomarker data presented at SITC 2020 that included clinical and mechanism of action data for AGEN2373 (anti-CD137 antibody) in a Phase 1 clinical trial that revealed clinical benefit without liver toxicity, as well as for AGEN1777 (anti-TIGIT bispecific), which is Fc enhanced for optimized immune performance and broader benefit. We also reported on our VISION benefit prediction model that identified an immunologic signature that could predict patients who would respond to balstilimab and balstilimab/zalifrelimab with an 87% probability of success in such model.

With respect to our novel discovery pipeline, our most advanced asset is our next generation anti-CTLA-4 antibody (AGEN1181), an IgG1 anti-CTLA-4 antagonist.  Based on preclinical and early clinical data, we believe that this molecule has potential advantages relative to competing anti-CTLA-4 molecules, including: 
 (1) potential to induce enhanced T cell priming via the engineered Fc region, as T cell priming is a crucial step in generating potent immune responses against cancer; 
 (2) differentiated ability to deplete intratumoral regulatory T cells, which otherwise represent a significant barrier to successful anti-cancer immune responses;
 (3) better combination potential with other antitumor or immunomodulatory antibodies, vaccines, and targeted therapies; and 
 (4) potential therapeutic benefit to a wider patient population, including the estimated 40% of patients who are unlikely to fully benefit from the first generation CTLA-4 therapies due to a genetic predisposition.
 AGEN1181 is currently in a Phase 1/2 dose escalation study as a monotherapy and in combination with AGEN2034, and we are planning discussions with the FDA to define an accelerated path to potential registration.  
 Partnered CPM Programs
 In June 2020, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement (the “Betta License Agreement”) with Betta, pursuant to which we granted Betta an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize balstilimab and zalifrelimab in the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan (collectively, “Greater China”). Under the terms of the Betta License Agreement, we received $15.0 million upfront and are eligible to receive up to $100.0 million in milestone payments plus royalties on any future sales in Greater China. In connection with this transaction, we also entered into a stock purchase agreement with Betta and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Betta (“Betta HK”), pursuant to which we sold to Betta HK 4,962,779 shares of Agenus common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $20.0 million in July 2020.
 In December 2018, we entered into a series of agreements with Gilead to collaborate on the development and commercialization of up to five novel I-O therapies. Pursuant to the collaboration agreements, we received an upfront cash payment from Gilead of $120.0 million following the closing in January 2019, and Gilead also purchased 11,111,111 shares of Agenus common stock for an additional $30.0 million.  At closing, Gilead received worldwide exclusive rights to our bispecific antibody, AGEN1423, as well as a right of first negotiation for two undisclosed programs. Gilead also received the exclusive option to license exclusively AGEN1223, a bispecific antibody, and AGEN2373, a monospecific antibody. For either, but not both, of the option programs, we have the right to opt-in to share Gilead’s development and commercialization costs in the United States in exchange for a profit (loss) share on a 50:50 basis and revised milestone payments. In November 2020, Gilead elected to return AGEN1423 to us and to voluntarily terminate the license agreement effective as of February 4, 2021. The option agreements remain in place, and we are responsible for developing each program up to the option decision points, at which time Gilead may acquire exclusive rights to the programs on option exercise. Pursuant to the terms of the option agreements, we remain eligible to receive up to $100.0 million in aggregate option exercise fees and, if exercised, up to approximately $1.0 billion in development and commercial milestone payments as well as royalties on net sales.
 In January 2015, we entered into a collaboration with Incyte Corporation (“Incyte”) to discover, develop and commercialize novel immuno-therapeutics using our antibody platforms. The collaboration was initially focused on four CPM programs targeting GITR, OX40, TIM-3 and LAG-3, and in November 2015, we expanded the alliance by adding three novel undisclosed CPM targets. Pursuant to the terms of the original agreement, Incyte paid us $25.0 million in upfront cash. Targets under the collaboration were designated as either profit-share programs, where the parties shared all costs and profits equally, or royalty-bearing programs, where Incyte funded all costs, and we were eligible to receive milestones and royalties. Under the original collaboration agreement, programs targeting GITR, OX40 and two of the undisclosed targets were designated as profit-share programs, while the other targets were royalty-bearing programs. For each profit-share product, we were eligible to receive up to $20.0 million in future contingent development milestones. For each royalty-bearing product, we were eligible to receive (i) up to $155.0 million in future contingent development, regulatory, and commercialization milestones and (ii) tiered royalties on global net sales at rates generally ranging from 6%-12%. Concurrent with the execution of the original collaboration agreement, we and Incyte also entered into a stock purchase agreement pursuant to which Incyte purchased approximately 7.76 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $35.0 million. In February 2017, we and Incyte amended the terms of the original collaboration agreement to, among other things, convert the GITR and OX40 programs from profit-share to royalty-bearing programs with royalties on global net sales at a flat 15% rate for each. In addition, the profit-share programs relating to two undisclosed targets were removed from the collaboration, with one reverting to Incyte and one to Agenus (the latter being our Fc enhanced anti-TIGIT program), each with royalties on global net sales at a flat 15% rate. The remaining three royalty-bearing programs in the collaboration targeting TIM-3, LAG-3 and one undisclosed target remain unchanged, and there are no more profit-share programs under the collaboration. Pursuant to the amended agreement, we received accelerated milestone payments of $20.0 million from Incyte related to the clinical development of INCAGN1876 (anti-GITR agonist) and INCAGN1949 (anti-OX40 agonist). Concurrent with the execution of the amendment agreement, we and Incyte entered into a separate stock purchase agreement whereby Incyte purchased an additional 10 million shares 
 6
 
of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $60.0 million. INCAGN1876 is currently in a Phase 2 trial exploring its safety, tolerability, and efficacy in combination with immune therapies, ipilimumab and nivolumab, in advanced or metastatic malignancies such as advanced or metastatic endometrial cancer, gastric cancer (including stomach, esophageal, and gastroesophageal junction), and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. INCAGN1949 is currently in a Phase 1/2 trial exploring its safety, tolerability, and efficacy in combination with immune therapies, ipilimumab and nivolumab, in advanced or metastatic malignancies such as advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma or RCC. In 2018, Incyte initiated clinical trials for their INCAGN2385 (LAG-3) and INCAGN2390 (TIM-3) programs, which remain in Phase 1 development.
 In April 2014, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Merck to discover and optimize fully-human antibodies against two undisclosed CPM targets. In 2016, Merck selected a lead product candidate against ILT4, MK-4830, to advance into preclinical studies, and subsequently initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial in August 2018. In November 2020, Merck initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial with MK-4830, triggering a $10.0 million milestone payment to us. Under the terms of the agreement, Merck is responsible for all future product development expenses for MK-4830, and Agenus is eligible to receive potential milestone payments plus royalties on any future sales.
 On September 20, 2018, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Agenus Royalty Fund, LLC, entered into a Royalty Purchase Agreement (the “XOMA Royalty Purchase Agreement”) with XOMA (US) LLC (“XOMA US”). Pursuant to the terms of the XOMA Royalty Purchase Agreement, XOMA US paid us $15.0 million at closing in exchange for the right to receive 33% of the future royalties and 10% of the future milestones that we are entitled to receive from Incyte and Merck, net of certain of our obligations to a third party and excluding the milestone we received from Incyte in the fourth quarter of 2018. After taking into account our obligations under the XOMA Royalty Purchase Agreement, as of December 31, 2020, we remain eligible to receive up to $450.0 million and $76.5 million in potential development, regulatory and commercial milestones from Incyte and Merck, respectively.
 We also have a collaboration agreement with Recepta Biopharma SA for the development of our antibodies targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1, which gives Recepta certain rights to South American countries. We expect to continue exploring additional future collaborations.
 Vaccine Platforms
 Our current neoantigen vaccine platforms for the treatment of cancer, and potentially other indications, include our heat shock protein (“HSP”) based Prophage vaccine candidates, and our fully synthetic, neoantigen vaccine candidates, ASV and PSV.
 We, and others, have demonstrated that immunization with HSP complexes generate both CD4 and CD8 positive T-cell immune responses. These activated T-cells target the cancer cells of the tumor, from which the HSP complexes were derived, for destruction. Thus, HSP complexes isolated from cancer cells may be particularly helpful in mediating successful immunization. Since HSPs are expressed in all tumor cells, the approach of immunizing with the HSP complexes isolated from a particular tumor may be broadly applicable to a variety of cancer types. We believe that we pioneered the use of gp96, an HSP, purified from a patient’s own tumor tissue, to make I-O vaccine candidates. 
     Prophage Vaccine Candidates
 Prophage (HSPPC-96), is an autologous cancer vaccine therapy derived from cancer tissues that are surgically removed from an individual patient designed to contain a broad sampling of potentially antigenic mutant proteins to educate the patient’s immune system to seek out and destroy cancer. Prophage in combination with pembrolizumab (Keytruda®) is advancing in a Phase 2 clinical trial collaboration with the National Cancer Institute (“NCI”). The trial is being conducted by the Brain Tumor Trials Collaborative, led by Dr. Mark Gilbert, Chief of the Neuro-Oncology Branch at the NCI Center for Cancer Research with product provided by Agenus and Merck. The trial is ongoing. 
    Neoantigen Vaccine Platforms
 Our neoantigen off-the-shelf vaccine platforms include: (i) individualized ASV®™, which targets the unique antigens expressed by a patient’s own tumor, and (ii) off-the-shelf (or pre-manufactured) PSV™, which targets antigens expressed across patients and tumors, potentially enabling us to treat broader categories of patients. 
 Our neoantigen vaccines are designed with unique features, intending to confer important advantages: (1) proprietary methods to develop an effective and relevant “Blueprint” of immunogenic neoantigens for each patient; (2) HSPs to efficiently deliver neoantigens to the right immune cells to activate an anti-cancer immune response. Our proprietary linker technology is designed to enable efficient neoantigen loading for a robust cancer specific immune response with significantly less peptide; and (3) QS-21 Stimulon® adjuvant, a potent immune stimulator now in GSK’s commercial shingles vaccine, Shingrix.  Our vaccines are powered by our proprietary adjuvant, QS-21 Stimulon and have demonstrated safety in Phase 1 clinical trials with data reported at the Next Gen Immuno-oncology congress.
     QS-21 Stimulon Adjuvant
 7
 
QS-21 Stimulon is an adjuvant, which is a substance added to a vaccine or other immunotherapy that is intended to enhance an immune response to the target antigens. QS-21 Stimulon is a natural product, a triterpene glycoside, or saponin, purified from the bark of the Chilean soapbark tree, Quillaja saponaria. QS-21 Stimulon has the ability to stimulate an antibody-mediated immune response and has also been shown to activate cellular immunity. It has become a key component in the development of investigational preventive vaccine formulations across a wide variety of diseases. These studies have been carried out by academic institutions and pharmaceutical companies in the United States and internationally. A number of these studies have shown QS-21 Stimulon to be significantly more effective in stimulating immune responses than aluminum hydroxide or aluminum phosphate, the adjuvants most commonly used in approved vaccines in the United States today. In January 2019, we announced that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation awarded us a grant to develop an alternative, plant cell culture-based manufacturing process to ensure the continuous future supply of QS-21 Stimulon adjuvant, which we are pursuing in partnership with Phyton Biotech.
    Partnered QS-21 Stimulon Programs
 In 2006, we entered into a license agreement and a supply agreement with GSK for the use of QS-21 Stimulon (the “GSK License Agreement” and the “GSK Supply Agreement,” respectively). In 2009, we entered into an Amended and Restated Manufacturing Technology Transfer and Supply Agreement (the “Amended GSK Supply Agreement”) under which GSK has the right to manufacture all of its requirements of commercial grade QS-21 Stimulon. GSK is obligated to supply us, or our affiliates, licensees, or customers, certain quantities of commercial grade QS-21 Stimulon for a stated period of time. In March 2012, we entered into a First Right to Negotiate and Amendment Agreement amending the GSK License Agreement and the Amended GSK Supply Agreement to clarify and include additional rights for the use of QS-21 Stimulon (the “GSK First Right to Negotiate Agreement”). In addition, we granted GSK the first right to negotiate for the purchase of Agenus or certain of our assets, which expired in March 2017. As consideration for entering into the GSK First Right to Negotiate Agreement, GSK paid us an upfront cash payment of $9.0 million, $2.5 million of which was creditable toward future royalty payments. We refer to the GSK License Agreement, the Amended GSK Supply Agreement and the GSK First Right to Negotiate Agreement collectively as the GSK Agreements. In 2017, we received a final milestone payment of $1.0 million from GSK and are no longer entitled to any additional milestone payments under the GSK Agreements. Under the terms of the Agreement, we are generally entitled to receive a 2% royalty on net sales of prophylactic vaccines for a period of 10 years after the first commercial sale of a resulting GSK product, which was triggered with GSK’s first commercial sale of Shingrix in 2017. Notably, we have already monetized and sold this entire royalty stream as discussed in more detail below. The GSK License and Amended GSK Supply Agreements may be terminated by either party upon a material breach if the breach is not cured within the time specified in the respective agreement. The termination or expiration of the GSK License Agreement does not relieve either party from any obligation which accrued prior to the termination or expiration. Among other provisions, the license rights granted to GSK survive expiration of the GSK License Agreement. The license rights and payment obligations of GSK under the Amended GSK Supply Agreement survive termination or expiration, except that GSK's license rights and future royalty obligations do not survive if we terminate due to GSK's material breach unless we elect otherwise. We do not incur clinical development costs for products partnered with GSK.
 In September 2015, we monetized a portion of the royalties associated with the GSK License Agreement to an investor group led by Oberland Capital Management for up to $115.0 million in the form of a non-dilutive royalty transaction. Under the terms of a note purchase agreement with the investor group (the “Note Purchase Agreement”), we received $100.0 million at closing for which the investors had the right to receive 100% of our worldwide royalties under the GSK License Agreement on sales of GSK’s Shingrix and malaria (RTS,S) prophylactic vaccine products that contain our QS-21 Stimulon adjuvant to pay down principle and interest. In November 2017, and pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, we received an additional $15.0 million in cash from the investors based on the approval of Shingrix by the FDA. Pursuant to the terms of this transaction, we retained the right to receive all royalties from GSK after all principal, interest and other obligations were satisfied under the Note Purchase Agreement. The Note Purchase Agreement also allowed us to buy back the loan and extinguish the notes early under pre-specified terms, which we did in January 2018.
 In January 2018, we sold 100% of all royalties we were entitled to receive from GSK to HCR and used the proceeds to extinguish the debt under the Note Purchase Agreement. HCR paid approximately $190.0 million at closing for the royalty rights, of which approximately $161.9 was used to extinguish the prior notes, yielding us approximately $28.0 million in net proceeds. We were also entitled to receive up to $40.35 million in milestone payments from HCR based on sales of GSK’s vaccines as follows: (i) $15.1 million upon reaching $2.0 billion last-twelve-months net sales any time prior to 2024 (the “First HCR Milestone”) and (ii) $25.25 million upon reaching $2.75 billion last-twelve-months net sales any time prior to 2026. GSK’s net sales of Shingrix for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 exceeded $2.0 billion. As a result, we received the First HCR Milestone of $15.1 million in 2020 after GSK’s net sales of Shingrix in 2019 exceeded $2.0 billion.
 Manufacturing
 Manufacturing CPM Antibodies
 In December 2015, we acquired an antibody manufacturing pilot plant in Berkeley, CA from XOMA Corporation (“XOMA”), which we refer to as “Agenus West.” A team of former XOMA employees with valuable chemistry, manufacturing and controls 
 8
 
experience joined us and continue to operate the facility. Since the acquisition of Agenus West, we have made significant improvements in the plant, and added additional headcount increasing both scale and capacity. Agenus West is currently producing antibody drug substance for certain of our proprietary antibody programs (monospecific and bispecific). In some cases, we have been able to deliver clinical grade material from research cell banks in approximately six to nine months, which is significantly faster than the industry average of 12-18 months. Agenus West utilizes cutting-edge technology platforms, enabling us to be self-reliant and giving us the advantage of drug substance manufacturing speed, cost efficiency, operational flexibility and manufacturing technology transfer to commercial scale partners—all with desired product quality, and with the goal of benefiting patients. In November 2020, we entered into a new long-term lease in Emeryville, CA for cGMP manufacturing space, which we intend to use for certain of our own commercial manufacturing requirements in the future.
 The quality control organization for all of our product candidates in Berkeley and Lexington performs a series of release assays designed to ensure that our antibody drug substance and vaccine product meets all applicable specifications. Our quality assurance staff also reviews manufacturing and quality control records prior to batch release in an effort to assure conformance with cGMP as mandated by the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies. Our manufacturing staff is trained and routinely evaluated for conformance to rigorous manufacturing procedures and quality standards. This oversight is intended to ensure compliance with FDA and foreign regulations and to provide consistent drug substance and vaccine output. Our quality control and quality assurance staff are similarly trained and evaluated as part of our effort to ensure consistency in the testing and release of the product, as well as consistency in materials, equipment and facilities.
 Manufacturing Cancer Vaccines
 We manufacture our cancer vaccine candidates in our Lexington, MA facility.
 We have established, within a single facility, well-defined, cost efficient vaccine manufacturing under cGMP conditions, including bioanalytical, quality control and quality assurance, logistics, distribution and supply chain management. After manufacturing, Prophage and ASV vaccine candidates are tested and released by our analytical and quality systems staff. 
QS-21 Stimulon
 Except in the case of GSK, we have retained worldwide manufacturing rights for QS-21 Stimulon, and we have the right to subcontract manufacturing for QS-21 Stimulon. In addition, under the terms of our agreement with GSK, upon request by us, GSK is committed to supply certain quantities of commercial grade QS-21 Stimulon to us and our licensees for a fixed period.
Intellectual Property Portfolio 
 We seek to protect our technologies through a combination of patents, trade secrets and know-how, and we currently own, co-own or have exclusive rights to approximately 30 issued United States patents and approximately 30 issued foreign patents. We also own, co-own or have exclusive rights to approximately 40 pending United States patent applications and approximately 370 pending foreign patent applications. We may not have rights in all territories where we may pursue regulatory approval for our product candidates.
  Through various acquisitions, we own, co-own, or have exclusive rights to a number of patents and patent applications directed to various methods and compositions, including methods for identifying therapeutic antibodies and product candidates arising out of such entities’ technology platforms. In particular, we own patents and patent applications relating to our Retrocyte Display technology platform, a high throughput antibody expression platform for the identification of fully-human and humanized monoclonal antibodies. This patent family is projected to expire between 2029 and 2031. We own, co-own, or have exclusive rights to patents and patent applications directed to various methods and compositions, including a patent directed to methods for identifying phosphorylated proteins using mass spectrometry. This patent is projected to expire in 2023. In addition, as we advance our research and development efforts with our institutional and corporate collaborators, we are seeking patent protection for certain newly identified therapeutic antibodies and product candidates. We can provide no assurance that any of our patents, including the patents that we acquired or in-licensed, will have commercial value, or that any of our existing or future patent applications, including the patent applications that were acquired or in-licensed, will result in the issuance of valid and enforceable patents. 
 The patent rights for each of our clinical candidates, together with the year in which the basic product patent expires (not including any regulatory exclusivities such as the six-month pediatric extension and/or the granted patent term extension in the U.S. and Japan and Supplementary Patent Certificate in Europe), are those for the programs set forth in the table below. Unless otherwise indicated, the years set forth in the table below pertain to the basic product patent expiration for the respective products. Patent term extensions, supplementary protection certificates and pediatric exclusivity periods are not reflected in the expiration dates listed in the table below. In some instances, we may obtain later-expiring patents relating to our products directed to particular forms or compositions, to methods of manufacturing, or to use of the drug in the treatment of particular diseases or conditions. However, in some cases, such patents may not protect our drug from generic or, as applicable, biosimilar competition after the expiration of the basic patent.

 Various patents and patent applications have been exclusively licensed to us by the following entities:
 University of Virginia
 In connection with our acquisition of PhosImmune in December 2015, we obtained exclusive rights to a portfolio of patent applications and one issued patent relating to PTTs under a patent license agreement with the University of Virginia (“UVA”). The UVA license gives us exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the PTT technology. Under the license agreement, we will pay low to mid-single digit running royalties on net sales of PTT products, and a modest flat percentage of sublicensing income. In addition, we may be obligated to make milestone payments of up to $2.7 million for each indication of a licensed PTT product to complete clinical trials and achieve certain sales thresholds. The term of the UVA license agreement ends when the last of the licensed patents expires or becomes no longer valid. As of March 2021, the last granted patent that is licensed to us by UVA will expire in late 2033, and there are currently pending patent applications that, if granted, will not expire until mid-2037. The UVA license agreement may be terminated as follows: (i) by UVA in connection with our bankruptcy or cessation of business relating to the licensed technology, (ii) by UVA if we commit a material, uncured breach or (iii) by us for our convenience on 180 days written notice. 
Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research
 On December 5, 2014, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Agenus Switzerland Inc. (formerly known as 4-Antibody AG) (“4-AB”), entered into a license agreement with the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research Ltd. (“Ludwig”), which replaced and superseded a prior agreement entered into between the parties in May 2011. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, Ludwig granted 4-AB an exclusive, worldwide license under certain intellectual property rights of Ludwig and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center arising from the prior agreement to further develop and commercialize GITR, OX40 and TIM-3 antibodies. On January 25, 2016, we and 4-AB entered into a second license agreement with Ludwig, on substantially similar terms, to develop CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies. Pursuant to the December 2014 license agreement, 4-AB made an upfront payment of $1.0 million to Ludwig. The December 2014 license agreement also obligates 4-AB to make potential milestone payments of up to $20.0 million for events prior to regulatory approval of licensed GITR, OX40 and TIM-3 products, and potential milestone payments in excess of $80.0 million if such licensed products are approved in multiple jurisdictions, in more than one indication, and certain sales milestones are achieved. Under the January 2016 license agreement, we are obligated to make potential milestone payments of up to $12.0 million for events prior to regulatory approval of CTLA-4 and PD-1 licensed products, and potential milestone payments of up to $32.0 million if certain sales 
 10
 
milestones are achieved. Under each of these license agreements, we and/or 4-AB will also be obligated to pay low to mid-single digit royalties on all net sales of licensed products during the royalty period, and to pay Ludwig a percentage of any sublicensing income, ranging from a low to mid-double digit percentage depending on various factors. The license agreements may each be terminated as follows: (i) by either party if the other party commits a material, uncured breach; (ii) by either party if the other party initiates bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceedings; or (iii) by 4-AB or us (as applicable) for convenience upon 90 days’ prior written notice. The license agreements also contain customary representations and warranties, mutual indemnification, confidentiality and arbitration provisions.
 Regulatory Compliance
 Governmental authorities in the United States and other countries extensively regulate the pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing and distribution, among other things, of our investigational product candidates. In the United States, the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and other federal statutes and regulations, subject pharmaceutical products to rigorous review.
 In order to obtain approval of a new product from the FDA, we must, among other requirements, submit proof of safety and efficacy as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product. In most cases, this proof entails extensive pre-clinical, clinical, and laboratory tests. Before approving a new drug or marketing application, the FDA may also conduct pre-licensing inspections of the company, its contract research organizations and/or its clinical trial sites to ensure that clinical, safety, quality control, and other regulated activities are compliant with Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”), or Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”), for specific non-clinical toxicology studies. The FDA may also require confirmatory trials, post-marketing testing, and extra surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products, or place conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of these products. Once approved, the labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing, and distribution of a drug or biologic product must be in compliance with FDA regulatory requirements.
 In Phase 1 clinical trials, the sponsor tests the product in a small number of patients or healthy volunteers, primarily for safety at one or more doses. Phase 1 trials in cancer are often conducted with patients who have end-stage or metastatic cancer. In Phase 2, in addition to safety, the sponsor evaluates the efficacy of the product in a patient population somewhat larger than Phase 1 trials. Phase 3 trials typically involve additional testing for safety and clinical efficacy in an expanded population at geographically dispersed test sites. The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time.
 The sponsor must submit to the FDA the results of pre-clinical and clinical testing, together with, among other things, detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product, in the form of a new drug application (“NDA”), or in the case of biologics, a BLA. In a process that can take a year or more, the FDA reviews this application and, when and if it decides that adequate data are available to show that the new compound is both safe and effective for a particular indication and that other applicable requirements have been met, approves the drug or biologic for marketing.
 Whether or not we have obtained FDA approval, we must generally obtain approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities of international jurisdictions prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those jurisdictions. We are also subject to cGMP, GCP, and GLP compliance obligations and are subject to inspection by international regulatory authorities. International requirements may in some circumstances be more rigorous than U.S. requirements and may require additional investment in manufacturing process development, non-clinical studies, clinical studies, and record-keeping that are not required for U.S. regulatory compliance or approval. The time required to obtain this approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and can also require significant resources in time, money and labor.
 Under the laws of the United States, the countries of the European Union and other nations, we and the institutions where we sponsor research are subject to obligations to ensure the protection of personal information of human subjects participating in our clinical trials. We have instituted procedures that we believe will enable us to comply with these requirements and the contractual requirements of our data sources. The laws and regulations in this area are evolving, and further regulation, if adopted, could affect the timing and the cost of future clinical development activities.
 We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and other current and potential future federal, state, or local regulations. Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biological materials, various radioactive compounds, and for some experiments we use recombinant DNA. We believe that our procedures comply with the standards prescribed by local, state, and federal regulations; however, the risk of injury or accidental contamination cannot be completely eliminated. We conduct our activities in compliance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Recombinant DNA Research.
 Additionally, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations.

Competition
 Competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense. Many pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies have products on the market and are actively engaged in the research and development of products for the treatment of cancer.
 Many competitors have substantially greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, sales, distribution, and technical resources, and more experience in research and development, clinical trials, and regulatory matters, than we do. Competing companies developing or acquiring rights to more efficacious therapeutic products for the same diseases we are targeting, or which offer significantly lower costs of treatment, could render our products noncompetitive or obsolete. See Part I-Item 1A. “Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Commercialization of Our Product Candidates-Our competitors may have superior products, manufacturing capability, selling and marketing expertise and/or financial and other resources.”
 Academic institutions, governmental agencies, and other public and private research institutions conduct significant amounts of research in biotechnology, medicinal chemistry and pharmacology. These entities have become increasingly active in seeking patent protection and licensing revenues for their research results. They also compete with us in recruiting and retaining skilled scientific talent.
 The CPM drug landscape is crowded with several competitors developing assets against a number of targets. Our development plans are spread out across various indications and lines of therapy, either alone or in combination with other assets. Our competitors range from small cap to large cap companies, with assets in pre-clinical or clinical stages of development. Therefore, the landscape is dynamic and constantly evolving. We and our partners have CPM antibody programs, currently in clinical stage development targeting various pathways (as mono- or multi-specifics) including PD-1, CTLA-4, GITR, OX40, TIM-3, LAG-3, CD73, TGFb and CD137. We are aware of many companies that have antibody-based products on the market or in clinical development that are directed to the same biological targets as these programs, including, without limitation, the following: (1) BMS markets ipilimumab, an anti-CTLA-4 antibody, and nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, and is developing additional antagonists to LAG-3, TIM-3 and TGFb. BMS also has next generation anti-CTLA-4 antibodies in the clinic, which may be competitive to our next generation anti-CTLA-4 program, (2) Merck has an approved anti-PD-1 antibody, as well as anti-CTLA-4 and LAG-3 antagonists recruiting in clinical trials, (3) Regeneron has an approved anti-PD-1 antibody as well as antibodies targeting LAG-3 and GITR in the clinic, (4) Roche/Genentech has an approved anti-PD-L1 antibody as well as bispecific antibodies targeting CD137 and LAG-3 in clinical development (5) AstraZeneca has an approved anti PD-L1 antibody, as well as antibodies targeting CTLA-4 and CD73 in the clinic, and (6) Pfizer has an approved anti-PD-L1 (with Merck KgaA) as well as agents targeting PD-1, TGFbR1 and CD137 in clinical development. Besides these PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies that were approved in the U.S., we are also aware of competitors with approved PD-1 agents in ex-U.S. geographies such as China. These include Innovent Biologics (Eli Lilly has ex-China rights), Shanghai Junshi Biosciences (Coherus BioSciences has rights to co-develop in U.S. and Canada), Shanghai HengRui Pharmaceuticals and Beigene (Novartis has ex-China rights). 
 We are also aware of other competitors with clinical-stage PD-1/PD-L1 agents including AbbVie, Amgen, Arcus Biosciences, Akeso Bio, Biocad Ltd., Boehringer Ingelheim, Checkpoint Therapeutics, CStone Pharmaceuticals (EQRx has ex-China rights), CSPC ZhongQi Pharmaceutical Technology, GSK, Gilead Sciences, Genor Biopharma/ Apollomics, Genrix (Shanghai) Biopharmaceutical, Incyte, ImmuneOncia Therapeutics Inc., Jounce Therapeutics, Janssen, Lee’s Pharmaceuticals, Mabspace Biosciences, Maxinovel Pharmaceuticals, Novartis, Servier, 3D Medicines, Shanghai Henlius Biotech Co Ltd, Sinocelltech, Shandong New Time Pharmaceutical Co Ltd, and Taizhou Houdeaoke Technology. In addition, we are also aware of anti-PD-(L)1 monospecific agents that are preclinical in stage. We are also aware of competitors developing bispecifics targeting PD-1 or PD-L1.
 We are aware of companies developing “next-generation” anti-CTLA-4 approaches, which may be competitive to our next-generation anti-CTLA-4 program (AGEN1181). For example, BMS has 3 next-generation CTLA-4 programs in the clinic: a non-fucosylated anti CTLA-4 antibody, a peptide-masked version of ipilimumab and a peptide masked version of the non-fucosylated anti CTLA-4 antibody; the peptide masked versions are designed to localize activity to the tumor and minimize systemic toxicity associated with parent drug. We are also aware of companies advancing clinical stage, CTLA-4 targeting multispecifics as a next-generation approach, including, but not limited to, Macrogenics, Xencor, AstraZeneca, Akeso Biopharma, Alphamab, Alpine Immune Sciences, and Sichuan Baili Pharmaceuticals. We are also aware of next-generation assets targeting CTLA-4 preclinically.
 We are also aware of competitors with clinical stage monospecific drug candidates against CTLA-4, GITR, OX40, LAG-3, TIM-3, CD73, TGFb, and CD137, in addition to those named earlier in this section. As outlined above, some of these include, but are not limited to AbbVie, Adagene, Arcus Biosciences, Alligator Biosciences, Beigene, Compass Therapeutics, Corvus Pharmaceuticals, CStone Therapeutics, Eli Lilly, Innovent Biologics, Inhibrx, Lyvgen Biopharma, MedPacto, Novartis, Astellas, Servier, Scholar Rock, and Sanofi. We are also aware of preclinical stage competitors developing monospecific agents against these targets. Further, we are also aware of competitors developing bispecifics targeting these pathways.
 Additionally, we are advancing our TIGIT program towards an IND filing and are aware of competitors with clinical stage anti-TIGIT antibodies. These include, but are not limited to, Arcus Biosciences, BMS, Beigene, Compugen, iTeos Therapeutics, Merck, Mereo Biopharma, Roche, Innovent Biologics, Merck KGaA and Seattle Genetics. We are also aware of competitor programs in 
 12
 
preclinical development against this target. There is no guarantee that our antibody product candidates will be able to successfully compete with our competitors’ antibody products and product candidates. 
 We are conducting both monotherapy and combination trials in second line cervical cancer. We are aware that Merck’s PD-1 antagonist, Keytruda, has been approved in advanced cervical cancer. We are also aware of industry sponsored clinical trials, including exploratory studies, that are underway in this setting. Clinical stage competitors include, but are not limited to, Regeneron (anti-PD-1), BMS (anti-PD-1 alone or in combination with CTLA-4), Seattle Genetics and Genmab (antibody drug conjugate targeting Tissue Factor), Iovance Biotherapeutics (autologous TILs), Merck KgaA (anti-PD-L1/TGFb), Roche (anti-PD-L1 alone or in combination with anti-TIGIT), Vaccibody (HPV vaccine in combination with anti-PD-L1), Biocad (anti-PD-1), Genor Biopharma (anti-PD-1), Gloria Biosciences (Anti-PD-1), Shanghai Henlius Biotech (anti-PD-1 in combination with albumin bound paclitaxel), Akeso Bio (anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 bispecific), Lee Pharmaceuticals (anti-PD-L1) and Innovent Biologics (anti-PD-1 alone or in combination with anti-CTLA-4). 
  We have autologous vaccine programs in clinical development including our Prophage vaccine in clinical development for GBM. We are aware of other therapeutic options in GBM that could compete with our vaccine, including but not limited to the following: Merck markets temozolomide for treatment of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (“ndGBM”) and refractory astrocytoma. Other companies are developing vaccines for the treatment of patients with ndGBM, including, but not limited to, Mimivax Inc. (SurVaxM). Other companies may begin development programs as well. We are advancing our neoantigen vaccine, AutoSynVax, in solid tumors. There are companies advancing neoantigen vaccines that compete with our HSP based vaccines including, but not limited to: Gritstone Oncology, BioNTech, Moderna/Merck, Genocea Biosciences, ISA Pharmaceuticals, Nouscom, and Vaccibody.
 In addition, and prior to regulatory approval, if ever, our vaccines and our other product candidates may compete for access to patients with other products in clinical development, with products approved for use in the indications we are studying, or with off-label use of products in the indications we are studying. We anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter markets we seek to address and scientific developments surrounding immunotherapy and other traditional cancer therapies continue to accelerate.
 Our subsidiary company, AgenTus Therapeutics, is advancing iNKT therapy. We are aware of competitors advancing NKT therapies, including but not limited to, Kuur Therapeutics and BrightPath Biotherapeutics. 
 Several other vaccine adjuvants are in development or in use and could compete with QS-21 Stimulon for inclusion in vaccines. These adjuvants may include but are not limited to: (1) oligonucleotides, under development by Pfizer, Idera, and Dynavax, (2) MF59, under development by Novartis, (3) IC31, under development by Intercell (now part of Valneva), (4) MPL, under development by GSK, (5) Matrix-MTM, under development by Novavax, (6) AS03, under development by GSK, and (7) TQL 1055, under development by Adjuvance Technologies. In the past, we have provided QS-21 Stimulon to other entities under materials transfer arrangements. In at least one instance, it is possible that this material was used without our permission to develop synthetic formulations and/or derivatives of QS-21. In addition, other companies and academic institutions are developing saponin adjuvants, including derivatives and synthetic formulations. These sources may be competitive to our ability to execute future partnering and licensing arrangements involving QS-21 Stimulon. The existence of products developed by these and other competitors, or other products of which we are not aware, or which other companies may develop in the future, may adversely affect the marketability of products developed or sold using QS-21 Stimulon.
 We are also aware of a third party that manufactures pre-clinical material purporting to be comparable to QS-21 Stimulon. The claims being made by this third party may create marketplace confusion and have an adverse effect on the goodwill generated by us and our partners with respect to QS-21 Stimulon. We are also aware of other manufacturers of QS-21. Any diminution of this goodwill may have an adverse effect on our ability to commercialize future products, if any, incorporating this technology, either alone or with a third party.
 Employees
 As of February 28, 2021, we had 359 employees, of whom 76 were PhDs and 26 were MDs. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
Corporate History
 Antigenics L.L.C. was formed as a Delaware limited liability company in 1994 and was converted to Antigenics Inc., a Delaware corporation, in February 2000 in conjunction with our initial public offering of common stock. On January 6, 2011, we changed our name from Antigenics Inc. to Agenus Inc.
