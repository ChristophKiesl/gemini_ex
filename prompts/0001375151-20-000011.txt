Item 1. Business
Company Overview
Zogenix, Inc. (Zogenix, We or the Company) is a global pharmaceutical company committed to developing and commercializing transformative therapies to improve the lives of patients and their families living with rare diseases. We are primarily focused on developing and commercializing two therapeutic product candidates: Fintepla, a low-dose fenfluramine, for two pediatric epilepsy disorders and MT1621 for a mitochondrial depletion disorder.
We own and control worldwide development and commercialization rights to Fintepla, our lead product candidate, for which we have filed a new drug application (NDA) with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking approval to market and sell the product in the treatment of Dravet syndrome, a rare and devastating pediatric epilepsy disorder. In March 2019, we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Nippon Shinyaku Co., Ltd. to support the sales and distribution of the product in Japan, if approved. Fintepla is also under late-stage development for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), another rare and devastating form of childhood-onset epilepsy. Additionally, we are evaluating Fintepla in other rare epileptic syndromes and diseases in Phase 2 and Investigator Initiated Studies.
In September 2019, we acquired all the outstanding equity interests of Modis Therapeutics, Inc. (Modis), a privately-held biopharmaceutical company based in Oakland, California. Modis holds an exclusive worldwide license from Columbia University in New York City (Columbia) to certain intellectual property rights owned or controlled by Columbia to develop and commercialize MT1621. MT1621 is an investigational deoxynucleoside-combination substrate enhancement therapy in development for the treatment of thymidine kinase 2 deficiency (TK2d), an inherited mitochondrial DNA depletion disorder that predominantly affects children and is often fatal. For the acquisition of Modis, we transferred aggregate upfront transaction consideration of approximately $246.5 million, which consisted of cash payments of $175.5 million and common stock with a fair value of $68.1 million. Also included in the aggregate upfront consideration were $3.5 million of transaction costs incurred, reduced by a net working capital adjustment receivable of $0.6 million.
Our Strategy
Our mission is to develop and commercialize transformative therapies to improve the lives of patients and their families living with rare diseases. To achieve this mission, we are executing on the following strategy:
•Seek regulatory approval and commence commercialization of Fintepla, if approved, for the treatment of patients with Dravet syndrome. In November 2019, the FDA accepted for review our NDA resubmission for Fintepla for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome. The FDA granted priority review for the NDA for Fintepla, which established a target decision date of six months from the date of receipt, with an assigned Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date of March 25, 2020. On February 27, 2020, we announced that the FDA extended the PDUFA target action date to June 25, 2020 to provide time to review additional data we submitted in response to the FDA’s information requests. In addition, our Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for Fintepla in Dravet syndrome submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has been under review since its acceptance in March 2019 and we anticipate a decision on the MAA from the EMA in the fourth quarter of 2020. We have entered into manufacturing and supply agreements for Fintepla and are continuing to build our internal commercial capabilities for potential commercialization.
•Seek regulatory approval of Fintepla for the treatment of LGS. In February 2020, we reported positive top-line results from our global Phase 3 clinical trial (Study 1601) of Fintepla for the treatment of LGS. The trial met its primary objective of demonstrating that Fintepla at a dose of 0.7 mg/kg/day was superior to placebo in reducing the frequency of drop seizures and demonstrated statistically significant improvements versus placebo in key secondary efficacy measures, including the proportion of patients with a greater than 50% in drop seizure frequency. We plan to submit a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for LGS, the timing of which will be based on discussions with the FDA.
•Advance the development of MT1621 for the treatment of TK2d. In October 2019, we announced positive top-line results from our global, retrospective Phase 2 study (the RETRO study) at the World Muscle Society congress in Copenhagen. 94.7% of treated patients had either improved (68%) or stabilized (26%) overall responses in major functional domains. A survival analysis using a time-dependent Cox regression model showed that the difference in probability of survival between treated patients and untreated natural history control patients was statistically significant (p<0.0006). Among clinical responders, a subset demonstrated profound responses, in some cases re-acquiring previously lost motor milestones such as ambulation, respiratory function and feeding. Safety data from RETRO indicated that MT1621 was generally well-tolerated. We plan to seek feedback from regulatory authorities during the second quarter of 2020 to determine the path forward to a potential submission of an NDA.
•Pursue development of additional indications for Fintepla. In addition to Dravet syndrome and LGS, we believe that the unique mechanism of action of Fintepla has the potential to treat other epileptic encephalopathies where there is a significant unmet medical need. We are currently conducting a Phase 2 exploratory clinical trial by enrolling patients with rare epilepsy disorders including Doose syndrome, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, Dup 15q syndrome, CDKL5 deficiency disorder, mutations in PCDH19 gene, mutations in Na+ channel genes who do not meet diagnostic criteria for Dravet syndrome and patients between one and two years of age with Dravet syndrome. The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Fintepla in these patient populations to potentially support future Phase 3 studies. In addition, ongoing Investigator Initiated Studies are being conducted in Sunflower Syndrome, CDKL5, and Doose syndrome.
Our Clinical Product Candidates 
Fintepla for Patients with Dravet Syndrome 
Dravet syndrome is a rare form of pediatric-onset epilepsy with life threatening consequences for patients and for which current treatment options are limited. Fintepla has received orphan drug designation in the United States and the European Union (the EU) for the treatment of Dravet syndrome. In addition, Fintepla for the treatment of Dravet syndrome received Fast Track designation from the FDA in January 2016. 
We initiated our Phase 3 clinical trials for Fintepla for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in North America (Study 1501) in January 2016 and in Europe and Australia in June 2016 (Study 1502). Study 1501 and Study 1502 are each identical randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled studies of Fintepla as adjunctive therapy for patients with uncontrolled seizures who have Dravet syndrome. In January 2017, we announced our plan to report top-line results from Study 1501 and Study 1502 via a prospective merged study analysis approach whereby top-line results from the first approximately 120 subjects randomized into either Study 1501 or 1502 would have their study results analyzed and be reported initially as “Study 1”. In April 2017, we completed enrollment of Study 1 and, in September 2017, we announced positive top-line results for the 119 patients included in the Study 1 Phase 3 trial. The Study 1 trial met its primary objective of demonstrating that Fintepla, at a dose of 0.7 mg/kg/day (26 mg/day maximum), is superior to placebo as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of Dravet syndrome in children and young adults based on change in the frequency of convulsive seizures between the 6-week baseline observation period and the 14-week treatment period (p<0.001). In the trial, Fintepla at a dose of 0.7 mg/kg/day also demonstrated statistically significant improvements versus placebo in all key secondary measures, including the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful reductions in seizure frequency (50% or greater) and longest seizure-free interval. The same analyses comparing a 0.2 mg/kg/day Fintepla dose versus placebo also demonstrated statistically significant improvement compared with placebo. Fintepla was generally well-tolerated and no case of valvular heart disease or pulmonary arterial hypertension was observed in any patients.
We originally presented Study 1 data results in December 2017 at the 71st American Epilepsy Society (AES) Annual Meeting. In that and other presentations, we expressed doses of Fintepla as doses of the HCl salt, with an upper limit of 0.8 mg/kg/day and 30 mg maximum daily dose. Due to current regulatory guidelines, we have chosen to express Fintepla doses from all Fintepla studies as the fenfluramine base-equivalent, with an upper limit dosing of 0.7 mg/kg/day and 26 mg maximum daily dose.
In September 2016, we initiated Part 1 of Study 1504, a two-part, double blind, randomized, two arm pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of Fintepla in Dravet syndrome patients who are taking stiripentol with valproate and/or clobazam as part of their baseline standard care. Part 1 investigated the pharmacokinetic profile and safety of Fintepla when co-administered with the stiripentol regimen (stiripentol with valproate and/or clobazam). Based on the results of the pharmacokinetic and safety portion of the trial, in February 2017 we initiated the safety and efficacy portion of Study 1504 utilizing Fintepla at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg/day (14 mg/day maximum). Part 2 of Study 1504, a two-arm study, compared Fintepla versus placebo across the titration and 12-week maintenance periods at multiple sites located in the Netherlands, United States, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom (the UK) and Spain. In January 2018, we announced patient enrollment was complete at 87 patients, with 43 patients randomized into the Fintepla-arm and 44 patients randomized to the placebo arm. In July 2018, we reported positive top-line results from the safety and efficacy portion of Study 1504. The study results, which are consistent with those reported in Study 1, successfully met the primary objective of demonstrating that Fintepla, at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg/day, when co-administered with the stiripentol regimen, was superior to placebo as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of Dravet syndrome in children and young adults based on change in the frequency of convulsive seizures between the 6-week baseline observation period and the 15-week treatment period (p<0.001). In the trial, Fintepla at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg/day when co-administered with the stiripentol regime also demonstrated statistically significant improvements versus placebo in all key secondary measures, the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful reductions in seizure frequency (50% or greater) and longest seizure-free interval. Fintepla 
was generally well-tolerated in this study, with adverse events consistent with those observed in Study 1 and the known safety profile of fenfluramine and no case of valvular heart disease or pulmonary arterial hypertension was observed in any patient.
Upon completion of our Fintepla Phase 3 trials, eligible patients were permitted to enroll in Study 1503, an ongoing open-label extension (OLE) trial to study the long-term safety and effectiveness of Fintepla. In December 2018, we presented interim data from Study 1503 regarding the effectiveness and overall safety of Fintepla observed in the study, including the long-term cardiovascular assessments and findings at the 72nd Annual Meeting of the AES. A total of 232 patients from Study 1503 were included in the interim analysis of Study 1503. As of March 13, 2018, the interim cutoff date, the median duration of treatment with Fintepla was 256 days and the range was 58-634 days (equivalent to 161 patient-years of exposure to Fintepla). In this interim analysis population of 232 patients, a total of 22 (9.5%) patients had discontinued treatment for the following reasons: lack of efficacy (16), subject withdrawal (2), adverse event (1), Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP), (1), physician decision (1), and withdrawal by caregiver (1). Approximately 90% of patients remained in the study at the time of the interim analysis. The median percent reduction in monthly convulsive seizure frequency over the entire OLE treatment period was 66.8% (compared with baseline frequency established in the core Phase 3 studies). Over the same period, 64.4% of children and young adults showed a >50% reduction in convulsive seizure frequency and 41.2% showed a >75% reduction. The occurrence of adverse events was consistent with the Phase 3 placebo-controlled studies. The most common adverse events occurring in more than 10% of children and young adults were pyrexia (22%), nasopharyngitis (20%), decreased appetite (16%), influenza (12%), diarrhea (11%), and upper respiratory tract infection (10%). A total of 13.4% of children lost >7% body weight at some point during the trial; in 42% of those children, weight loss abated during the period covered by the interim analysis. Over the course of the OLE treatment period included in the interim analysis, one patient died from SUDEP that was deemed unrelated to Fintepla. A total of 703 color doppler echocardiograms were performed to assess cardiovascular health at baseline, week 4 or 6, and then every 3 months during Study 1503. No patient developed valvular heart disease or pulmonary arterial hypertension at any time during the study while receiving daily treatment with Fintepla. We conducted an additional interim analysis of data from Study 1503 as of February 2019, which will be presented at the American Academy Neurology Annual meeting in Toronto in April 2020. This analysis included a total of 330 patients with a median treatment duration of 445 days (range 7-899 days). In patients treated up to one year (n=222), there was a 77% decrease (p<0.001) in median convulsive seizure frequency when comparing treatment effect at months 10 - 12 to baseline; and for those treated up to two years (n=52), the median decrease in convulsive seizure frequency as of two years on study drug was 83% (p<0.001) compared to baseline.
In October 2019, we presented additional data from Study 1503 at the Childhood Neurology Society (CNS) Congress which showed long-term, clinically meaningful reduction in convulsive seizure frequency in young Dravet syndrome patients (under six years of age). A total of 42 of 158 (26.6%) subjects enrolled in Study 1503 were under six years of age. The median baseline monthly convulsive seizure frequency for this age group prior to treatment was 10.7 seizures per month (ranging from 4.0 to 147.3). The median decrease in monthly convulsive seizure frequency for the under six years of age group over the entire observation period compared to baseline was 75.5% (p<0.001). This compared to a median decrease of 60.1% (p<0.001) in the older, over-six years of age group and a median decrease of 63.6% (p<0.001) in the overall study population (aged 2-18 years). Fintepla was generally well-tolerated and no case of valvular heart disease or pulmonary arterial hypertension was observed in any patient at any time.
Also at the October 2019 CNS Congress, we presented a post-hoc pooled analysis from Study 1 and Study 1504 which demonstrated that Fintepla reduced frequency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and focal-to-bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. A total of 206 enrolled patients were randomized to placebo (n=84), or to treatment with Fintepla 0.7 (n=40), 0.4 (n=43), or 0.2 (n=39) mg/kg/day. The median baseline monthly frequency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures ranged from 8.0 to 12.3 per month in the four dose groups, and decreased by 80%, 64%, and 48% in the Fintepla 0.7, 0.4, and 0.2 mg/kg/day groups, respectively, compared to 10% in the placebo group. Focal-to-bilateral tonic-clonic seizures were experienced by fewer patients and had a median baseline frequency of 2.0 to 4.7 per month. During treatment, median percent reductions in focal-to-bilateral tonic-clonic seizure frequency were 97%, 33% and 69% in the Fintepla 0.7, 0.4, and 0.2 mg/kg/day groups, respectively, and 39% in the placebo group. Fintepla was generally well-tolerated and no case of valvular heart disease or pulmonary arterial hypertension occurred in any patient. The most common treatment emergent adverse events occurring in ³10% of patients in any treatment group were decreased appetite, lethargy, fatigue, somnolence, and diarrhea.
In October 2019, at CNS Congress, we also presented data from a Single-Dose, Open-Label Pharmacokinetic Study to Investigate the Drug-Drug Interaction Potential of Fintepla and Cannabidiol. This poster described data from a Phase 1, single-dose, open-label study to assess the tolerability and pharmacokinetic profiles (potential drug-drug interaction) of fenfluramine with and without co-administration of cannabidiol (CBD). The results of the study showed that the effects of CBD on fenfluramine are unlikely to require dose adjustments when the drugs are co-administered.
In February 2019, we completed our rolling submission of an NDA with the FDA and submitted a MAA to the EMA for Fintepla for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome. In March 2019, the EMA accepted the MAA and initiated its review and we anticipate a decision on the MAA in the fourth quarter of 2020.
In April 2019, we received a Refusal to File (RTF) letter from the FDA regarding our NDA for Fintepla for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome. Upon its preliminary review, the FDA determined that the NDA submitted in February 2019 was not sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. In the RTF letter, the FDA cited two reasons for the RTF decision: first, certain non-clinical studies were not submitted to allow assessment of the chronic administration of fenfluramine; and, second, the application contained an incorrect version of a clinical dataset, which prevented the completion of the review process that is necessary to support the filing of the NDA.
We held a Type A meeting with the FDA in May 2019 to review the two issues identified in the RTF letter. Based on the final meeting minutes received, the FDA agreed with our plan to resubmit the NDA for Fintepla without the inclusion of the new chronic toxicity studies requested in the RTF letter. With regards to the second issue, we conducted a root cause analysis identifying the issue with the incorrect clinical dataset submitted in the original NDA, and we discussed the analysis with the FDA and the FDA requested that we include certain findings from our analysis in the resubmitted NDA. In September 2019, we resubmitted the NDA for Fintepla for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome to the FDA, and in November 2019, the FDA accepted the NDA for filing. The FDA granted priority review for the NDA for Fintepla, which established a target decision date of six months from the date of receipt, with an assigned PDUFA date of March 25, 2020. 
As part of their review, the FDA requested additional information. We provided the FDA with additional data to conduct additional efficacy analyses from our two pivotal studies in Dravet syndrome. On February 27, 2020, we announced that the FDA extended the PDUFA target action date to June 25, 2020, which provides the FDA additional time to review.
Fintepla for Patients with LGS 
LGS is another rare, refractory, debilitating pediatric-onset epilepsy with life threatening consequences for patients and for which current treatment options are limited and suboptimal. Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, we funded an open-label, dose-finding, investigator-initiated study of the effectiveness and tolerability of Fintepla as an adjunctive therapy in patients with LGS. In December 2016, we presented initial data from an interim analysis of the first 13 patients to have completed at least 12 weeks of this Phase 2 clinical trial at the 70th Annual Meeting of the AES. In this interim analysis, Fintepla was observed to provide clinically meaningful improvement in major motor seizure frequency in patients with severe refractory LGS, with 7 out of 13 patients (54%) achieving at least a 50% reduction in the number of major motor seizures, at doses below the 0.7 mg/kg/ day maximum allowed dose. In addition, Fintepla was generally well-tolerated without any observed signs or symptoms of valvular heart disease or pulmonary hypertension. We believe these data indicate that Fintepla has the potential to be a safe and effective adjunctive treatment of major motor seizures for patients with LGS. Based on the strength of the LGS data generated, in the first quarter of 2017, we submitted an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) to the FDA to initiate a Phase 3 program of Fintepla in LGS. Our IND for Fintepla as a potential treatment for LGS became effective in April 2017. In the first half of 2017, Fintepla received orphan drug designation for the treatment of LGS from the FDA in the United States and the EMA in the EU.
In November 2017, we announced the initiation of our multicenter global Phase 3 clinical trial of Fintepla as an adjunctive treatment for seizures in patients with LGS (Study 1601). Study 1601 has two parts: Part 1 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Fintepla when added to a patient’s current anti-epileptic regimen. The study included a total of 263 patients between the ages of 2 and 35 years whose seizures were currently uncontrolled while on one or more anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) randomized into three treatment groups: Fintepla 0.7 mg/kg/day (26 mg maximum daily dose; n=87), Fintepla 0.2 mg/kg/day (n=89), and placebo (n=87). The median age of patients was 13 years, with 29% being 18 years or older. Patients entering the study were taking between one and four AEDs and previously had tried and discontinued an average of seven other AEDs. The median baseline drop seizure frequency across the study groups was 77 seizures per month. After establishing baseline seizure frequency for 4 weeks, randomized patients were titrated to their dose over a 2-week titration period, followed by a 12-week fixed dose maintenance period. Patients who completed Part 1 were eligible to enter Part 2 of the clinical trial, an ongoing 12-month OLE study to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability and effectiveness of Fintepla. 
Announcement of Top-line Clinical Trial Results for Study 1601
On February 6, 2020, we announced positive top-line results from Study 1601. The trial met its primary objective of demonstrating that Fintepla at a dose of 0.7 mg/kg/day was superior to placebo in reducing the frequency of drop seizures, 
based on the change between baseline and the titration and maintenance treatment period (p=0.0012). The same dose of Fintepla (0.7 mg/kg/day) also demonstrated statistically significant improvements versus placebo in key secondary efficacy measures, including the proportion of patients with a clinically meaningful reduction (≥50%) in drop seizure frequency. A decrease in the frequency of drop seizures between baseline and the treatment period was observed for a lower dose of Fintepla (0.2 mg/kg/day) compared to placebo, but this change did not reach statistical significance (p=0.0915). Fintepla was generally well-tolerated, with the adverse events consistent with those observed in our two prior Phase 3 studies in Dravet syndrome.
Study 1601 met its primary endpoint of showing a highly statistically significant reduction from baseline compared to placebo in the median percent change in monthly drop seizure frequency. Patients taking Fintepla 0.7 mg/kg/day achieved a median reduction of 26.5% compared to a median reduction of 7.8% in patients taking placebo (p=0.0012). Using a parametric analysis, patients taking Fintepla 0.7 mg/kg/day demonstrated a 26.5% greater reduction in mean monthly drop seizure frequency compared to placebo (p=0.0034). The median percent reduction in monthly drop seizures between baseline and the treatment period for the lower study dose of Fintepla (0.2 mg/kg/day), a secondary endpoint, was 13.2% and did not reach statistical significance compared to placebo (p=0.0915).
Additional secondary endpoints of the study were to compare the proportion of study patients treated with Fintepla 0.7 mg/kg/day who achieved a (≥50%) reduction in monthly drop seizures versus placebo and to compare Clinical Global Impression of Improvement ratings (CGI-I, a measure of improvement of worsening relative to baseline) as assessed by the investigator. Results are shown in the following table:

 | Fintepla 0.7 mg/kg/day(N=87) | Placebo(N=87)
Patients with ≥50% reduction in monthly drop seizures (T+M Period) | 25.3%(p=0.0165)¹ | 10.3% 
CGI-I (Proportion of Patients Improved) | 48.8%(p=0.0567)¹ | 33.8% 
CGI-I (Proportion of Patients Much Improved or Very Much Improved) | 26.3%(p=0.0007)¹ | 6.3% 
¹p-values versus Placebo | | 

Fintepla was generally well-tolerated in this study, with the adverse events consistent with those observed in our two prior Phase 3 studies in Dravet syndrome. The incidence of patients who experienced at least one treatment emergent adverse event was 89.7% of patients in the Fintepla 0.7 mg/kg/day group, 76.4% in the Fintepla 0.2 mg/kg/day group and 79.3% in the placebo group. The most common adverse events (≥10%) in the Fintepla-treated groups were decreased appetite, somnolence, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, and pyrexia. The incidence of serious treatment emergent adverse events was 11.5% (n=10) in the 0.7 mg/kg/day group, 4.5% (n=4) in the 0.2 mg/kg/day group, and 4.6% (n=4) in the placebo group. Six patients in the 0.7 mg/kg/day group had an adverse event leading to study discontinuation compared to four subjects in the 0.2 mg/kg/day group and one patient in the placebo group; the majority of these were considered treatment-related. There was one death during the trial (0.7 mg/kg/day group) caused by SUDEP, which was assessed by the investigator to be unrelated to the study drug.
No cases of valvular heart disease or pulmonary hypertension have been observed in Study 1601, including both Part 1 and Part 2. A total of 247 (93.9%) patients entered the OLE phase. We plan to submit an sNDA for LGS, the timing of which will be based on discussions with the FDA.
Fintepla for Other Potential Indications 
In addition to Dravet syndrome and LGS, we have initiated an exploratory Phase 2 study to understand the characteristics of additional rare epilepsy disorders in separate cohorts and evaluate whether Fintepla is safe and effective versus placebo in these patient populations. The study protocol has been finalized and we are currently seeking IRB approvals and proceeding with opening study sites in the U.S. We expect to enroll the first patient in this Phase 2 “basket study” in the second quarter of 2020.
MT1621 for Patients with TK2d
TK2d is a rare, debilitating, and often fatal genetic disorder that primarily affects infants and children and for which there are currently no approved therapies. As of September 6, 2019, the date we acquired Modis, Modis had completed the 
RETRO study of MT1621 in patients with TK2d and commenced a Phase 2 prospective, OLE study of patients with TK2d, Study MT-1621-101. MT1621 has received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA and access to the PRIME scheme by the EMA and we intend to seek accelerated regulatory review pathways in both the United States and Europe.
RETRO was a global retrospective study of MT1621, a fixed combination treatment of two pyrimidine nucleosides deoxycytidine and deoxythymidine (dC/dT), in 38 pediatric and adult patients with TK2d (median age of disease onset, 2.5 years) treated at eight clinical sites in the United States, Spain and Israel.
Subjects received MT1621 for a median of 71 weeks (range 92 days – 7 years). Each subject was scored across motor, respiratory, and feeding domains according to pre-defined response criteria and was compared to pre-treatment status to assess whether responses improved, remained stable, or worsened. Parallel to RETRO, we compiled a comprehensive, global TK2d Natural History dataset from published studies and individual case reports to document untreated patients’ disease course. From this natural history dataset, 68 patients reflecting the range of disease severity, age, and age of disease onset, were selected as a control group for treated patients in the RETRO study.
In October 2019, we announced positive top-line results from the pivotal Phase 2 RETRO study at the World Muscle Society congress in Copenhagen. 94.7% of treated patients had either improved (68%) or stabilized (26%) overall responses in major functional domains. A survival analysis using a time-dependent Cox regression model showed that the difference in probability of survival between treated patients and untreated natural history control patients was statistically significant (p<0.0006). Among clinical responders, a subset demonstrated profound responses, in some cases re-acquiring previously lost motor milestones such as ambulation, respiratory function and feeding. Safety data from RETRO indicated that MT1621 was generally well-tolerated. Most reported adverse events were considered not related to study drug (199 of 292), with mild or moderate diarrhea being the most common treatment-related adverse event (AE), occurring in 63% of patients. Serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in 14 subjects (37%). The majority of SAEs were deemed related to TK2d; two patients experienced three events related to study drug alone (kidney stone, kidney stone removal, diarrhea). Two adult-onset patients stopped treatment due to asymptomatic increases in aminotransferase liver enzymes (no increase in bilirubin levels), which resolved upon discontinuation of treatment. We plan to seek feedback from regulatory authorities during the second quarter of 2020 to determine the path forward to a potential submission of an NDA.
Competition
The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary and differentiated therapeutics. We face competition from a number of sources, some of which may target the same indications as our product candidates, including large pharmaceutical companies, smaller biopharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions, many of which have greater financial resources, research and development capabilities, sales and marketing capabilities, manufacturing capabilities, experience in obtaining regulatory approvals for product candidates and/or other resources than us. We will face competition not only in the commercialization of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities, but also for the in-licensing or acquisition of additional product candidates.
Fintepla
Prior to 2018, there were no FDA-approved treatments indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome. The standard of care for the treatment of seizures in patients with Dravet syndrome usually involved a combination of the following anticonvulsant drugs: clobazam, clonazepam, levetiracetam, topiramate, valproic acid, ethosuximide and zonisamide. In June 2018, the FDA approved the first treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome, as well as LGS, GW Pharmaceuticals’ Epidiolex® (cannabidiol or CBD). Epidiolex is a liquid drug formulation of plant-derived purified CBD, which is a chemical component of the Cannabis sativa plant, more commonly known as marijuana. GW’s CBD was subsequently approved for the treatment of Dravet syndrome and LGS by the European Commission (as Epidyolex®) in September of 2019.  In August 2018, the FDA approved a second treatment, Biocodex’s Diacomit® (stiripentol), for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients who are also taking clobazam. Stiripentol is approved in Europe, Canada and Japan for the treatment of Dravet syndrome when used in conjunction with valproate and/or clobazam. 
Fintepla has a novel mechanism of action (selective serotonin activity and possibly sigma-1 activity) that is different from the other antiepileptic drugs currently available and in clinical development in the United States and the EU for the treatment of epileptic encephalopathies like Dravet syndrome, including cannabidiol or stiripentol. Currently approved drugs have a different and distinct mechanism of action from Fintepla. As such, we do not expect the recent approvals of cannabidiol or stiripentol in the United States or Europe will block the FDA or EMA from granting approval of Fintepla.
Multiple companies are developing clinical-staged product candidates for the potential treatment of Dravet syndrome. Ovid Therapeutics, Inc. is currently evaluating its product candidate OV935, a first-in-class inhibitor of the enzyme cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CH24H), for the potential treatment of adult and pediatric patients with Dravet syndrome and LGS in Phase 2 clinical trials. Additional clinical stage candidates for the treatment of Dravet syndrome include Ataluren from PTC Therapeutics (exploratory Phase 2), Huperzine-A from Supernus Pharmaceuticals (Phase 1/2), and clemizole (Phase 1) being evaluated by Epygenix Therapeutics, Inc. 
Several other companies, including Encoded Therapeutics, Inc., Neucyte, Inc., NeuroCycle Therapeutics, Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., Stoke Therapeutics, Inc., and Xenon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. have disclosed that they are evaluating preclinical drug candidates, including gene therapies and small molecules, for the potential treatment of Dravet syndrome.
MT1621
Currently, we are not aware of any pharmaceutical product candidates that have been approved for the treatment of a primary mitochondrial disease. Similarly, we are not aware of any pharmaceutical companies who are developing a pharmaceutical product candidate for the treatment of TK2d. 
Beyond TK2d, a number of pharmaceutical companies are developing clinical-staged product candidates for the potential treatment of other mitochondrial diseases, including Metro International Biotech LLC, PTC Therapeutics, Inc., Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Reneo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Stealth BioTherapeutics, Inc., and Wellstat Therapeutics Corp.
Manufacturing and Supply
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish or own any manufacturing facilities with respect to the manufacture of Fintepla, MT1621 or any future product candidates.
Fintepla
 In February 2019, we entered into a master supply agreement with Aptuit (Oxford) Limited, an Evotec company (Aptuit) pursuant to which Aptuit will be our commercial manufacturer and supplier of the fenfluramine active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) used in Fintepla. The term of the master supply agreement is five years, which term shall be automatically extended for successive two-year periods thereafter, unless terminated earlier. Aptuit has been providing the API to us for our clinical trial material supply needs and registration batches for the past several years. In July 2019, we entered into a supply agreement (PCI Pharma Agreement) with Penn Pharmaceutical Services Limited, trading as PCI Pharma Services (PCI Pharma), pursuant to which PCI Pharma will procure the raw materials (other than the active pharmaceutical ingredient) for, test, bottle and package an oral solution of Fintepla. Pursuant to the PCI Pharma Agreement, at a specified time prior to the anticipated receipt of the first marketing authorization by a regulatory agency to market Fintepla, and then each month following such receipt, we are required to deliver a rolling forecast of our expected commercial orders, a portion of which will be considered a binding, firm order.
The term of the PCI Pharma Agreement is five years, which term shall be automatically extended for successive two-year periods thereafter, unless terminated earlier. After the second anniversary of the Effective Date, either party may terminate the PCI Pharma Agreement at any time without cause following a specified notice period applicable to the respective party. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement (1) upon written notice if the other party has failed to remedy a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or other obligations under the PCI Pharma Agreement within a specified period following receipt of written notice of such breach, (2) immediately in the event of a material breach of the other party’s representations, warranties or other obligations under the PCI Pharma Agreement and in the event that such breach is not capable of remedy and (3) in the event that the other party files for bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, administration or receivership proceedings, or a substantial portion of the assets of such party is assigned for the benefit of such party’s creditors. We may also terminate the PCI Pharma Agreement immediately in the event PCI Pharma is unable to supply Fintepla at specified quantities and within certain times. PCI Pharma may also terminate the Agreement upon notice if it determines its performance of services would violate applicable law. PCI Pharma’s manufacturing services under the PCI Pharma Agreement will also terminate automatically if Fintepla is withdrawn as a result of regulatory review or we decide to cease development activities of Fintepla.
We expect to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of our product candidates and their component raw materials for use in our internal research efforts and clinical trials and in relation to any future commercialization of our product candidates. Our third-party manufacturers are responsible for obtaining the raw materials necessary to manufacture our product candidates. Additional third-party manufacturers are and will be used to formulate, fill, 
label, package and distribute investigational drug products and eventually our products, if and when our product candidates receive approval. This approach allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure while enabling us to focus our expertise on developing and commercializing our product candidates. Although we believe we have multiple potential sources for the manufacture of our product candidates and their related raw materials, we currently rely on single manufacturers for different aspects of manufacturing of our products.
MT1621
As a part of our acquisition of Modis in September 2019, we assumed a manufacturing supply agreement with ST Pharm Co. LTD (ST Pharm), pursuant to which ST Pharm will be our clinical materials manufacturer and supplier of both 2’-deoxycytidine and 2’-deoxythymidine APIs used in MT1621. The term of the supply agreement is five (5) years from the date of agreement (October 2017), which term can be extended for successive two-year periods thereafter, unless terminated earlier. ST Pharm has been providing the API for the clinical trial material supply needs and registration batches since the beginning of MT1621 clinical trials. In addition, we also assumed a supply agreement with Catalent Pharma Solutions (Catalent), pursuant to which Catalent will procure all materials other than the API, test, fill into drug product packs and package and release the MT1621 powder for oral solution finished product. 
Strategic and License Agreements
Fintepla
In October 2014, we acquired Brabant Pharma Limited (Brabant) in a business acquisition and obtained worldwide development and commercialization rights to Fintepla, one of our lead product candidates. Under the terms of the acquisition, we agreed to make future milestone payments to the former owners of Brabant for up to $95.0 million in the event we achieve certain milestones with respect to Fintepla, consisting of $50.0 million in regulatory milestones and $45.0 million in sales milestones. In 2019, our Fintepla MAA submission for the treatment of Dravet syndrome was accepted by the EMA for filing and our NDA submission for the treatment of Dravet syndrome was accepted by the FDA for filing. Each acceptance by the respective regulatory agency triggered a $10.0 million milestone payment. To date, we have paid $20.0 million of the maximum $50.0 million in regulatory milestones under the purchase agreement.
In addition, we have a collaboration and license agreement with the Universities of Antwerp and Leuven in Belgium (the Universities) that runs through September 2045. Under the terms of the agreement, the Universities granted us an exclusive worldwide license to use the data obtained from a study related to low-dose fenfluramine for the treatment of Dravet syndrome, as well as certain other intellectual property. We are required to pay a mid-single-digit percentage royalty on net sales of products containing low-dose fenfluramine for the treatment of Dravet syndrome or, in the case of a sublicense of products containing low-dose fenfluramine for the treatment of Dravet syndrome, a percentage in the mid-twenties of the sub-licensing revenues. The agreement may be terminated by the Universities if we (a) do not use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) develop and commercialize products containing low-dose fenfluramine for the treatment of Dravet syndrome or related conditions stemming from infantile epilepsy, or (ii) seek approval of products containing low-dose fenfluramine for the treatment of Dravet syndrome in the United States; or (b) if we become insolvent or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors or should any petition in bankruptcy, or similar relief, be filed by or against us. We can terminate the agreement upon specified prior written notice to the Universities.
MT1621
As a result of our acquisition of Modis, we became party to the Exclusive License Agreement, by and between Modis and Columbia, dated as of September 26, 2016 (the Columbia Agreement), related to MT1621. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products worldwide, including to meet certain development and commercialization milestones within specified periods of time. Upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones, we are required to pay Columbia up to $2.9 million and $25.0 million, respectively, as well as tiered royalties on sales for each licensed product, at percentages ranging from the mid-single digits to the high single-digits. The royalty obligations and Columbia Agreement will expire on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis upon the later of (i) 15 years after the first bona fide commercial sale of a licensed product, (ii) the expiration of the last to expire valid patent claim covering a licensed product in a country or (iii) expiration of any regulatory exclusivity covering such licensed product. The Columbia Agreement may be terminated by either by Columbia or by us in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party, or by Columbia in the event we are subject to specified bankruptcy, insolvency or similar circumstances. We can terminate the Columbia Agreement either in its entirety or on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, upon specified prior written notice to Columbia, provided we are not exploiting licensed products in such countries.
We also became party to a license agreement between two other research institutions related to MT1621 where we may be required to pay up to $3.0 million for research, development and regulatory milestone events and up to $10.0 million for certain sales milestone events. We are also required to pay tiered royalties ranging from low to mid-single digits on net sales of licensed product.
Intellectual Property
Our success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to obtain, expand and protect our intellectual property estate, enforce patents, maintain trade secret and trademark protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of other parties.
Fintepla
As of December 31, 2019, we have rights to six issued U.S. patents and three issued foreign patents, one of which is involved in an Opposition Proceeding in the European Patent Office. These patents, entitled “Method for the Treatment of Dravet Syndrome,” cover claims related to methods for treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome with Fintepla and are expected to provide protection of the associated claims in the U.S. and other countries through 2033 and 2034, respectively. In addition, we also have 8 currently pending U.S. patent applications (which includes two provisional applications) and 97 pending foreign applications (which includes two allowed South Africa applications and three Patent Cooperation Treaty applications) in the Fintepla series of patent cases.
MT1621
 We have certain patent rights that we obtained through our acquisition of Modis. In September 2016, Modis entered into the Columbia Agreement under which Modis was granted an exclusive worldwide license and sublicense to certain intellectual property rights owned or controlled by Columbia to develop and commercialize MT1621 and certain backup compounds for any application or purpose. These licensed patent rights include patents owned by Columbia and patents jointly owned by Columbia and Vall d’Hebron Research Institute (VHIR). VHIR delegated to Columbia the rights to enter into the Columbia Agreement on VHIR’s behalf. The patent family jointly owned by Columbia and VHIR is directed to the use of MT1621 to treat TK2d and includes an issued U.S. patent, and European and Japanese granted patents, each of which expire in 2036. In addition, there are pending patent applications in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico and Russia, as well as continuing applications in the United States and Europe. There are no patents covering the composition of matter in MT1621.
Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our product candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, pending patent applications we have filed or licensed from third parties may not result in the issuance of patents. 
Government Regulation
FDA Approval Process
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, record keeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, a clinical hold, warning letters, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production, withdrawal of the product from the market, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
FDA approval is required before any new drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves:
•completion of pre-clinical laboratory and animal testing and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice (GLP) regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;
•approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice (GCP) regulations, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each intended use;
•submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivot trials;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) requirements to ensure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quantity and purity, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs; and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the U.S.
Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, potency, biological activity, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The results of pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. Some pre-clinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to one or more proposed clinical trials, pre-clinical information or cGMP requirements and places a trial on clinical hold, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, our submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development.
Clinical trials involve the administration of an investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its 
stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
For purposes of an NDA submission and approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
•Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage.
•Phase 3: When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the product appears to be effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 trials are undertaken in larger patient populations to obtain additional evidence of clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites.
In some cases, the FDA may condition the approval of the NDA on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional pre-clinical and clinical studies to further assess the drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval. Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as post-marketing or Phase 4 studies.
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug. 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. NDAs must also contain extensive information relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) and proposed labeling, among other things.
The submission of an NDA may be subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual program user fees. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Under the PDUFA goals that are currently in effect, the FDA has a standard review goal of ten months from the date of filing of a NDA for a new molecular entity, and ten months from the date of receipt for an NDA for a non-new molecular entity, to review and act on the submission. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. During the FDA’s review of an NDA the FDA may inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The 
FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP, and if applicable, quality system regulation (QSR) requirements (for any medical device components), and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements before approving an NDA. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Once the FDA’s NDA review process is substantially complete, it may issue an approval letter, or it may issue a complete response letter (CRL) to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. CRLs generally outline the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
For some drugs, the FDA may determine that a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks of the drug, and may require submission of a REMS as a condition of approval. In determining whether a REMS is necessary, the FDA considers the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, the expected benefit of the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the size of the population likely to use the drug, the duration of treatment, and whether the drug is a new molecular entity. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate health care providers of the drug’s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, requirements that patients enroll in a registry or undergo certain health evaluations and other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to assess the strategy, at a minimum, at 18 months, three years, and seven years after the strategy’s approval.
In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.
Expedited Development and Review Programs 
The FDA has a fast track designation program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. For a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. 
Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a fast track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Under its current review goals, the FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of new molecular entity NDAs, and within six months of the receipt date for non-new molecular entity NDA.
In addition, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing clinical trials or if such trials fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
A sponsor may also seek FDA designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The Breakthrough Therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, which can also be granted to the same drug if relevant criteria are met.
Fast Track designation, priority review, and Breakthrough Therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
Post-Approval Requirements
Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to drug/device listing, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. There also are extensive U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) regulations applicable to marketed controlled substances.
Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP and, if applicable, QSR requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP or QSR and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP or QSR compliance.
The FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market, though the FDA must provide an application holder with notice and an opportunity for a hearing in order to withdraw its approval of an application. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
•consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
•mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
•the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug and device products that are placed on the market. While physicians may prescribe drugs and devices for off label uses, manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability.
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) and associated FDA regulations, which governs the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution, including a drug pedigree which tracks the distribution of prescription drugs. With the enactment of the Drug Quality and Security Act in November 2013, drug manufacturers will also be subject to requirements for identifying and tracking prescription drugs as they are distributed in the United States. The requirements of this law will be phased in over a ten-year period, including requirements for unique product identifiers and provision of product handling information to the FDA.
The FDA may require post-approval studies and clinical trials if the FDA finds they are appropriate based on available data, including information regarding related drugs. The purpose of such studies would be to assess a known serious risk or signals of serious risk related to the drug or to identify an unexpected serious risk when available data indicate the potential for a serious risk. The FDA may also require a labeling change if it becomes aware of new safety information that it believes should be included in the labeling of a drug. In addition, the FDA may also require a REMS for an approved product when new safety information emerges. 
With respect to post-market product advertising and promotion, the FDA imposes a number of complex requirements on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet and social media. The FDA has very broad enforcement authority under the FFDCA, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties, including the issuance of a warning letter directing entities to correct deviations from FDA standards, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre-cleared by the FDA, and state and federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions. 
Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications
An applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FFDCA to seek approval for modifications or new uses of products previously approved by the FDA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, and permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon published literature and the FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved product based on the prior pre-clinical or clinical trials conducted for the approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform new studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
To the extent that a Section 505(b)(2) NDA relies on studies conducted for a previously approved drug product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s current list of “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” known as the Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify for each listed patent that (1) the required patent information has not been filed; (2) the listed patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patent or that such patent is invalid is known as a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents through a Paragraph IV certification, the Section 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. The Section 505(b)(2) NDA application also will not be accepted or approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a New Chemical Entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product, has expired.
If the 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the referenced NDA and patent holders once the 505(b)(2) NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a legal challenge based on the Paragraph IV certification. Under the FFDCA, if a patent infringement lawsuit is filed against the 505(b)(2) NDA applicant within 45 days of receipt of the Paragraph IV certification notice, an automatic stay of approval is imposed, which prevents the FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA for 30 months, or until a court decision or settlement finding that the patent is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed, whichever is earlier. The court also has the ability to shorten or lengthen the 30 month stay if either party is found not to be reasonably cooperating in expediting the litigation. Thus, the 505(b)(2) NDA applicant may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of its product only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before its product may be commercialized.
The 505(b)(2) NDA applicant may be eligible for its own regulatory exclusivity period, such as three-year new product exclusivity. The first approved 505(b)(2) applicant for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new extended-release formulation for a previously approved product, may be granted three-year Hatch-Waxman exclusivity if one or more clinical trials, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA is precluded from making effective any other application for the same condition of use or for a change to the drug product that was granted exclusivity until after that three-year exclusivity period has expired. Additional exclusivities may also apply, such as an added six-month pediatric exclusivity period based on studies conducted in pediatric patients under a written request from the FDA.
Additionally, the 505(b)(2) NDA applicant may list its own relevant patents in the Orange Book, and if it does, it can initiate patent infringement litigation against subsequent applicants that challenge such patents, which could result in a 30-month stay delaying those applicants.
Orphan Drug Designation 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or, if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or inability to manufacture the product in sufficient quantities. The designation of such drug also entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. However, competitors, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our product candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. In addition, if an orphan designated product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity. 
In the EU, medicinal products: (a) that are used to treat or prevent life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions that affect no more than five in ten thousand people in the EU when the application is made; or (b) that are used to treat or prevent life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions and that, for economic reasons, would be unlikely to be developed without incentives; and (c) where no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned exists, or, if such a method exists, the medicinal product would be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, may be granted an orphan designation. The application for orphan designation must be submitted to the EMA and approved before an application is made for marketing authorization for the product. Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to up to ten years of market exclusivity (which may be extended for an additional two years if pediatric data have been produced in accordance with an agreed pediatric investigational plan). During this ten year period, with a limited number of exceptions, neither the competent authorities of the EU Member States, the EMA, or the EC are permitted to accept applications or grant marketing authorization for other similar medicinal products with the same therapeutic indication. However, marketing 
authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this latter product is safer, more efficacious or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the criteria for orphan designation are no longer met or if the orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Fintepla has received orphan drug designation for the treatment of patients with Dravet Syndrome in the United States, EU and Japan, and in the United States. for the treatment of patients with LGS.
Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program
In 2012, Congress authorized the FDA to award priority review vouchers to sponsors of certain rare pediatric disease product applications. This program is designed to encourage development of new drug and biological products for prevention and treatment of certain rare pediatric diseases. Specifically, under this program, a sponsor who receives an approval for a drug or biologic for a “rare pediatric disease” may qualify for a voucher that can be redeemed to receive a priority review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product. The sponsor of a rare pediatric disease drug product receiving a priority review voucher may transfer (including by sale) the voucher to another sponsor. The voucher may be further transferred any number of times before the voucher is used, as long as the sponsor making the transfer has not yet submitted the application. The FDA may also revoke any priority review voucher if the rare pediatric disease drug for which the voucher was awarded is not marketed in the United States within one year following the date of approval. 
For purposes of this program, a “rare pediatric disease” is a (a) serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years, including age groups often called neonates, infants, children, and adolescents; and (b) rare diseases or conditions within the meaning of the Orphan Drug Act. Congress has only authorized the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program until September 30, 2020. Consequently, sponsors of marketing applications approved after that date will not receive the voucher unless Congress reauthorizes the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program, for which legislation has been proposed in the current Congress. However, even if the program is not reauthorized, if a drug candidate receives Rare Pediatric Disease Designation before October 1, 2020, the sponsor of the marketing application for such drug will be eligible to receive a voucher if the application for the designated drug is approved by the FDA before October 1, 2022.
DEA Regulation
The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (CSA) establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA is concerned with the control of handlers of controlled substances, and with the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce.
The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use, and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. 
Fenfluramine, the active ingredient in Fintepla, is currently regulated as a Schedule IV drug in the United States. Substances in Schedule IV are considered to have a low potential for abuse relative to substances in Schedule III. A prescription for controlled substances in Schedule IV issued by a practitioner may be communicated either orally, in writing, or by facsimile to the pharmacist, and may be refilled if so authorized on the prescription or by call-in. Many commonly prescribed sleep aids (e.g., Ambien®, Sonata®), most benzodiazepines (e.g., Ativan®, Valium®, Versed®, Diastat®, Onfi®) and some weight loss drugs (e.g., Belviq®, Qsymia®) are also regulated as Schedule IV drugs.
Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized.
The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such 
as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances, and periodic reports made to the DEA. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance, and authorization must be obtained to destroy any controlled substance. In addition, special authorization and notification requirements apply to imports and exports.
To meet its responsibilities, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could eventuate in criminal proceedings.
Individual states also regulate controlled substances, and we and our contract manufacturers will be subject to state regulation on distribution of these products.
Foreign Regulation of Drug Development and Approval
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are subject to a variety of foreign regulatory requirements including those governing drug development, pre-clinical trials, human clinical trials, marketing approval, manufacturing, pharmacovigilance and post-marketing regulation for drugs. The foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with FDA approval set forth above, as well as additional country-specific regulations. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Approval by one regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. The approval process varies from country to country, can involve additional testing beyond that required by FDA, and may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, promotion, and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
Under the EU regulatory system, we may submit applications for marketing authorizations in more than one EU Member State either under a centralized, decentralized, or mutual recognition marketing authorization procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization for a medicinal product by the EC on the basis of a positive opinion by the EMA Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (ChMP) and is mandatory for certain categories of medicinal products, including orphan medicinal products. A centralized marketing authorization is valid for all EU Member States and the European Economic Area states. The decentralized procedure and the mutual recognition procedure apply between EU Member States. The decentralized marketing authorization procedure involves the submission of an application for marketing authorization to the competent authority of all EU member states in which the product is to be marketed. One national competent authority, selected by the applicant, assesses the application for marketing authorization. The competent authorities of the other EU Member States are subsequently required to grant marketing authorization for their territory on the basis of this assessment, except where grounds of potential serious risk to public health require this authorization to be refused. The mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of marketing authorizations delivered by the national competent authorities of EU Member States by the competent authorities of other EU Member States. The holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the competent authority of an EU Member State member state requesting that this authority recognize the marketing authorization delivered by the competent authority of another EU Member State member state for the same medicinal product. The EC may agree upon recommendation of the EMA to grant for medicines including those designated as orphan medicines a (i) conditional marketing authorization in the interest of public health under certain conditions; namely that unmet medical needs will be fulfilled, the benefit-risk balance of the product is positive, the benefit to public health of the medicinal product’s immediate availability on the market outweighs the risks due to need for further data and it is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data; or (ii) marketing authorization under “exceptional circumstances” when the applicant can show that it is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use and subject to specific procedures being introduced. This may arise in particular when the intended indications are very rare, in the present state of scientific knowledge, it is not possible to provide comprehensive information, or when generating data may be contrary to generally accepted ethical principles.
In 2016, the EMA launched its Priority Medicines, or PRIME, scheme. PRIME is a voluntary scheme aimed at enhancing the EMA’s support for the development of medicines that target unmet medical needs. It is based on increased interaction and early dialogue with companies developing promising medicines, to optimize their product development plans and speed up their evaluation to help them reach patients earlier. The scheme focuses on medicines that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments, or benefit patients without treatment options. These medicines are considered priority medicines by the EMA. To be accepted for PRIME, a medicine has to show its potential to benefit patients with unmet 
medical needs based on early clinical data. The benefits of a PRIME designation include the appointment of a CHMP rapporteur before submission of the marketing authorization application, early dialogue and scientific advice at key development milestones, and the potential to qualify products for accelerated review earlier in the application process.
Similar Similarly to the U.S., both marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA and the competent authorities of the individual EU Member States both before and after grant of the manufacturing and marketing authorizations. This includes control of compliance by the companies within the EU legal framework (i.e., GCP, GLP, cGMP and pharmacovigilance rules, which govern quality control of the manufacturing process and require documentation policies and procedures). We and our third party manufacturers are required under regulations to ensure that all of our processes, methods, and equipment are compliant with GCP, GLP, cGMP and pharmacovigilance rules. The EMA and national competent authorities have in the past, and expect that they will continue to, may arrange inspections to ensure that we adhere to these principles and regulations. Any adverse findings from such inspections, depending on their severity, may result in significant delays in obtaining a marketing authorization, may impose penalties or may result in other action by regulatory authorities.
Failure by us or by any of our third party partners, including suppliers, manufacturers, marketers and distributors to comply with EU laws and the related national laws of individual EU Member States governing the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, marketing authorization of medicinal products, pre-approval promotion of products, reporting of adverse health events, both before and after grant of marketing authorization, and marketing/promotion of such products following grant of authorization may result in administrative, civil, or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays in or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials or to grant marketing authorization, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, or variation of the marketing authorization, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing, or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines, and criminal penalties.
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws are applicable to manufacturers of products regulated by the FDA, such as us, and hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers of such products.
In particular, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the TRICARE, Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term “remuneration” is not defined in the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Moreover, the lack of uniform court interpretation of the Anti-Kickback Statute makes compliance with the law difficult. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Additionally, many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs in at least some cases, and do not contain safe harbors or statutory exceptions. Government officials have focused their enforcement efforts on marketing of healthcare services and products, among other activities, and have brought cases against numerous pharmaceutical and medical device companies, and certain sales and marketing personnel for allegedly offering unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an attempt to procure their business or reward past purchases or recommendations.
Another development affecting the healthcare industry is the increased use of the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act and, in particular, actions brought pursuant to the False Claims Act’s “whistleblower” or “qui tam” provisions. The civil False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil 
penalties for each separate false claim. The False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of inadequate care, kickbacks and other improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price and improper promotion of off-label uses (i.e., uses not expressly approved by FDA in a drug’s label). In addition, various states have enacted false claim laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not merely a federal healthcare program. 
The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services. Noncompliance with such beneficiary inducement provision of the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law can result in civil money penalties for each wrongful act, assessment of three times the amount claimed for each item or service and exclusion from the federal healthcare programs.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) created several new federal crimes, including health care fraud, and false statements relating to health care matters. The health care fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private third-party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, (collectively, the ACA) also imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements on drug manufacturers for any “transfer of value” made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers, and any ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for any payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission, and additional penalties for “knowing failures”. Manufacturers are required to report such data to the government by the 90th day of each calendar year.
Under California law, pharmaceutical companies must adopt a comprehensive compliance program that is in accordance with both the Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (OIG Guidance) and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals (PhRMA Code). The PhRMA Code seeks to promote transparency in relationships between health care professionals and the pharmaceutical industry and to ensure that pharmaceutical marketing activities comport with the highest ethical standards. The PhRMA Code contains strict limitations on certain interactions between health care professionals and the pharmaceutical industry relating to gifts, meals, entertainment and speaker programs, among others. Also, certain states have imposed restrictions on the types of interactions that pharmaceutical companies or their agents (e.g., sales representatives) may have with health care professionals, including bans or strict limitations on the provision of meals, entertainment, hospitality, travel and lodging expenses, and other financial support, including funding for continuing medical education activities.
Federal and state government price reporting laws require manufacturers to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs. Such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement and/or discounts on marketed products. Participation in these programs and compliance with the applicable requirements subject manufacturers to potentially significant discounts on products, increased infrastructure costs, and potentially limit the ability to offer certain marketplace discounts.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
We may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, HIPAA, and its implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, which established uniform standards for certain “covered entities” (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, commonly referred to as the economic stimulus package, included sweeping expansion of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards called the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) which became effective on February 17, 2010. Among other things, the new law makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates” — independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to 
enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition to HIPAA and HITECH, there are state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws.
We are also subject to foreign privacy laws in the foreign jurisdictions in which we sell our testing products. The interpretation, application and interplay of consumer and health-related data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain, contradictory and in flux. For example, the EU enacted Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)), has been enacted in the EU and went into full effect in May 2018. These texts introduce many changes to privacy and security in the EU, including stricter rules on consent and security duties for critical industries, including for the health sector. The interpretation of some rules is still unclear, and some requirements will be completed by national legislation. More generally, foreign laws and interpretations governing data privacy and security are constantly evolving and it is possible that laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with current practices, subjecting entities to government-imposed fines or orders. Additionally, following the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, we will have to comply with the GDPR and the UK GDPR, each regime having the ability to fine up to the greater of €20 million/ £17.5 million or 4% of global turnover. The relationship between the UK and the EU in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, for example around how data can lawfully be transferred between each jurisdiction, which exposes us to further compliance risk.
Third-Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement
The commercial success of our product candidates, if and when commercialized, will depend, in part, upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors at the federal, state and private levels. Third-party payors include governmental programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, private insurance plans and managed care plans. These third-party payors may deny coverage or reimbursement for a product or therapy in whole or in part if they determine that the product or therapy was not medically appropriate or necessary. Also, third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage through the use of formularies and other cost-containment mechanisms and the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments.
Changes in third-party payor coverage and reimbursement rules can impact our business. For example, the ACA changes include increased rebates a manufacturer must pay to the Medicaid program, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, and established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now provide 70% point-of-sale discounts on products covered under Part D. Further, the law imposes a significant annual, nondeductible fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with health care practitioners. 
Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. By way of example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts, or Tax Act, was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the individual mandate to carry health insurance. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas (“Texas District Court Judge”), ruled that the entire ACA is invalid based primarily on the fact that the Tax Act repealed the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA, on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, which is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the district court’s decision that the individual mandate was unconstitutional but remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. It is unclear how these decisions, subsequent appeals, if any, or other efforts to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact the law.
Other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
Recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed 
to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Individual states have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, and to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding, and/or continue to put pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, as well as increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations.
In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. There can be no assurance that our products will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that our products will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be established even if coverage is available or that the third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
Manufacturing Requirements
We and our third-party manufacturers must comply with applicable FDA regulations relating to FDA’s cGMP regulations and, if applicable, QSR requirements. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to, among other things, organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet cGMP requirements to the satisfaction of the FDA pursuant to a pre-approval inspection before we can use them to manufacture our products. We and our third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic unannounced inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including, among other things, warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties.
Other Regulatory Requirements
We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on us.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we employed 141 full-time employees. Of the full-time employees, 77 were engaged in product development, quality assurance and clinical development and regulatory activities, 22 were engaged in sales and marketing and 42 were engaged in general and administrative activities (including business and corporate development). 
None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good. We currently utilize two employer services companies to provide human resource services. These service companies are the employer of record for payroll, benefits, employee relations and other employment-related administration.
