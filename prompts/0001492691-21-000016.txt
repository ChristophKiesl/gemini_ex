Company Overview

Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. is North America's largest truckload carrier and a provider of transportation solutions, from its Phoenix, Arizona headquarters. The Company provides multiple truckload transportation, intermodal, and logistics services using a nationwide network of business units and terminals in the US and Mexico to serve customers throughout North America. In addition to its truckload services, Knight-Swift also contracts with third-party capacity providers to provide a broad range of truckload services to its customers while creating quality driving jobs for our driving associates and successful business opportunities for independent contractors. 
During 2020, we covered 1.5 billion loaded miles for shippers throughout North America, contributing to consolidated total revenue of $4.7 billion and consolidated operating income of $564.4 million. During 2020, the Trucking segment operated an average of 18,448 tractors (comprised of 16,379 company tractors and 2,069 independent contractor tractors) and 57,722 trailers. Additionally, the Intermodal segment operated an average of 577 tractors and 10,604 intermodal containers. Our three reportable segments are Trucking, Logistics, and Intermodal.
We have historically grown through a combination of organic growth, as well as through mergers and acquisitions (discussed below). Mergers and acquisitions have enhanced Knight's and Swift's businesses and service offerings with additional terminals, driving associates, revenue equipment, and capacity. Our multiple service offerings, capabilities, and transportation modes enable us to transport, or arrange transportation for, general commodities for our diversified customer base throughout the contiguous US and Mexico using our equipment, information technology, and qualified driving associates and non-driver employees. We are committed to providing our customers with a wide range of truckload, intermodal, and logistics services and continuing to invest considerable resources toward developing a range of solutions for our customers across multiple service offerings and transportation modes. Our overall objective is to provide truckload, intermodal, and logistics services that, when combined, lead the industry in margin and growth, while providing efficient and cost-effective solutions for our customers. 

Business Combinations and Investments

2017 Merger
On September 8, 2017, we became Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. upon the effectiveness of the 2017 Merger. We accounted for the 2017 Merger using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires that either Knight or Swift is designated as the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes ("Accounting Acquirer"). Based on the evidence available, Knight was designated as the Accounting Acquirer while Swift was the acquirer for legal purposes. Therefore, Knight’s historical results of operations replaced Swift’s historical results of operations for all periods prior to the 2017 Merger. 
Historical Acquisitions
Knight — Since 1999, Knight has acquired the outstanding stock of six short-to-medium haul truckload carriers, including Iowa-based Barr-Nunn (acquired in 2014), and Virginia-based Abilene (acquired in 2018). On February 1, 2021, Knight acquired a majority ownership position in Eleos, a Greenville, South Carolina based software provider, specializing in mobile driving workflow platforms.
Swift — Since 1966, Swift has completed fifteen acquisitions, including the 2013 acquisition of Central Refrigerated Transportation, LLC (formerly Central Refrigerated Transportation, Inc.). On January 1, 2020 Swift acquired a warehousing company to complement its suite of services.

Industry and Competition

Truckload carriers represent the largest part of the transportation supply chain for most retail and manufactured goods in North America and typically transport a full trailer (or container) of freight for a single customer from origin to destination without intermediate sorting and handling. Generally, the truckload industry is compensated based on miles, whereas the less-than-truckload industry is compensated based on package size and/or weight. Overall, the US trucking industry is large, fragmented, and highly competitive. We compete with thousands of truckload carriers, most of whom operate significantly smaller fleets than we do. Our trucking segments compete with other motor carriers for the services of driving associates, independent contractors, and management employees. To a lesser extent, our intermodal and logistics businesses compete with railroads, less-than-truckload carriers, logistics providers, and other transportation companies. Our logistics businesses compete with other logistics companies for the services of third-party capacity providers and management employees.
Our industry has encountered the following major economic cycles: 

Period | Economic Cycle 
2017 — 2019 | strong cycle, driven by a record pricing climate through 2018. The industry experienced increased demand through 2018 for transportation services, including contract and non-contract market demand, partially due to a strong retail season. Capacity became tighter in the second half of 2017 and throughout 2018, due to increasing government regulation, the driver shortage, and severe storms interrupting business, among other factors. Capacity increased in the second half of 2018 leading to an oversupply during 2019, lower spot market rates, and downward pressure on contract rates. 
2020 | the COVID-19 pandemic led to a new source of volatility throughout the global market in 2020. Economic activities were significantly curtailed across the nation at the onset of 2020, but began to resume in the second half of the year. Accordingly, demand in the freight market was weak in the beginning of the year and gradually strengthened in the second half of the year. The 2020 freight environment was disrupted, with unpredictable shipping volumes, shifts in pricing, and continued challenges in driver sourcing throughout the year. 

The principal means of competition in our industry are customer service, capacity, and price. In times of strong freight demand, customer service and capacity become increasingly important, and in times of weak freight demand, pricing becomes increasingly important. Most truckload contracts (other than dedicated contracts) do not guarantee truck availability or shipment volumes. Pricing is influenced by supply and demand.
The trucking industry faces the following primary challenges, which we believe we are well-positioned to address, as discussed under "Our Competitive Strengths" and "Our Mission and Company Strategy," below:
•tightening industry capacity;
•cumulative impacts of regulatory initiatives, such as ELDs, hours-of service limitations for drivers, and others;
•uncertainty in the economic environment, including changing supply chain and consumer spending patterns;
•driver shortages;
•increased insurance costs as significant verdicts and settlement amounts for accident claims impact the industry;
•significant and rapid fluctuations in fuel prices; and
•increased prices for new revenue equipment, design changes of new engines, and volatility in the used equipment sales market.

Our Competitive Strengths

As North America's largest truckload carrier, we believe that our principal competitive strengths are our regional presence, customer service (including our ability to provide multiple transportation solutions and configuration of equipment that satisfies customers' needs), operating efficiency, cost control, and technological enhancements in our revenue equipment and supporting back-office functions.

Regional Presence 
We believe that regional operations, which expanded with the merger between Knight and Swift, offer several advantages, including:• obtaining greater freight volumes,• achieving higher revenue per mile by focusing on high-density freight lanes to minimize non-revenue miles,• enhancing our ability to recruit and train qualified driving associates,• enhancing safety and driver development and retention,• enhancing our ability to provide a high level of service and consistent capacity to our customers,• enhancing accountability for performance and growth,• furthering our trucking capabilities to provide various shipping solutions to our customers, and• furthering our logistics capabilities to contract with more third-party capacity providers. 
Operating Efficiency and Cost Control 
We expect to increase operational efficiencies through the adoption of best practices and capabilities across our brands, as well as the overall size of our combined company. We operate modern tractors and trailers in order to obtain operating efficiencies and attract and retain driving associates. We believe a generally compatible fleet of tractors and trailers simplifies our maintenance procedures and reduces parts, supplies, and maintenance costs. We regulate vehicle speed, which we believe will maximize fuel efficiency, reduce wear and tear, and enhance safety. We continue to update our fleet with more fuel-efficient post-2014 US EPA emission compliant engines, install aerodynamic devices on our tractors, and equip our trailers with trailer blades, which have led to meaningful improvements in fuel efficiency. Our logistics and intermodal businesses focus on effectively optimizing and meeting the transportation and logistics requirements of our customers and providing customers with various sources and modes of transportation capacity across our nationwide service network. We invest in technology that enhances our ability to optimize our freight opportunities while maintaining a low cost per transaction.
Customer Service 
We strive to provide superior, on-time service at a meaningful value to our customers and seek to establish ourselves as a preferred truckload and logistics provider for our customers. We provide truckload capacity for customers in high-density lanes, where we can provide them with a high level of service, as well as flexible and customized logistics services on a nationwide basis. Our trucking services include dry van, refrigerated, and drayage, which also include dedicated, expedited, and cross-border truckload services, customized according to customer needs. Our logistics and intermodal services include brokerage, intermodal, and certain logistics, freight management, and non-trucking services, which provide various shipping alternatives and transportation modes for customers by utilizing our expansive network of third-party capacity providers and rail partners. We price our trucking, logistics, and intermodal services commensurately with the level of service our customers require and market conditions. By providing customers a high level of service, we believe we avoid competing solely based on price. 
Using Technology that Enhances Our Business 
We purchase and deploy technology that we believe will allow us to operate more safely, securely, and efficiently. Substantially all of our company-owned tractors are equipped with in-cab communication devices that enable us to communicate with our driving associates, obtain load position updates, manage our fleets, and provide our customers with freight visibility, as well as with ELDs that automatically record our driving associates' hours-of-service. The majority of our trailers are equipped with trailer-tracking technology that allows us to better manage our trailers. We have purchased and developed software for our logistics businesses that provides greater visibility of the capacity of our third-party providers and enhances our ability to provide our customers with solutions that offer a superior level of service. We have automated many of our back-office functions, and we continue to invest in technology that we expect will allow us to better serve our customers and improve overall efficiency. 

 Glossary of Terms
KNIGHT-SWIFT TRANSPORTATION HOLDINGS INC.


Our Mission and Company Strategy

Our mission is to operate truckload businesses that are industry leading in both margin and growth, while providing cost-effective solutions for our customers. Our success depends on our ability to efficiently and effectively manage our resources in providing transportation and logistics solutions to our customers, as well as our ability to leverage efficiencies and best practices across our brands. We evaluate growth opportunities based on customer demand and supply chain trends, availability of drivers and third-party capacity providers, expected returns on invested capital, expected net cash flows, and our company-specific capabilities.

Segment Operating Strategies
Trucking Segment | Our operating strategy for our Trucking segment is to achieve a high level of asset utilization within a highly disciplined operating system, while maintaining strict controls over our cost structure. We hope to achieve these goals by primarily operating in high-density, predictable freight lanes and attempting to develop and expand our customer base around each of our terminals by providing multiple truckload services for each customer. We believe this operating strategy allows us to take advantage of the large amount of freight transported in the markets we serve. Our terminals enable us to better serve our customers and work more closely with our driving associates. We operate a premium modern fleet that we believe appeals to driving associates and customers, reduces maintenance expenses and driving associate and equipment downtime, and enhances our fuel and other operating efficiencies. We employ technology in a cost-effective manner to assist us in controlling operating costs and enhancing revenue. 
Logistics Segment | Our operating strategy for our Logistics segment is to match the shipping needs of our customers with the capacity provided by our network of third-party carriers and our rail providers. Our goal is to increase our market presence, both in existing operating regions and in other areas where we believe the freight environment meets our operating strategy, while seeking to achieve industry-leading operating margins and returns on investment. 
Intermodal Segment | Our operating strategy for our Intermodal segment is to complement our regional operating model, allowing us to better serve customers in longer haul lanes, and reduce our investment in fixed assets. We have intermodal agreements with most major North American rail carriers. 

 Glossary of Terms
KNIGHT-SWIFT TRANSPORTATION HOLDINGS INC.


Growth Strategies 
We believe we have the terminal network, systems capability, and management capacity to support substantial growth. We have established a geographically diverse network that we believe can support a substantial increase in freight volumes, organic or acquired. Our network and business lines afford us the ability to provide multiple transportation solutions for our customers, and we maintain the flexibility within our network to adapt to freight market conditions. We believe our unique mix of regional management, together with our consistent efforts to centralize certain business functions to achieve collective economies of scale, allow us to develop future company leaders with relevant operating and industry experience, minimize the potential diseconomies of scale that can come with growth in size, take advantage of regional knowledge concerning capacity and customer shipping needs, and manage our overall business with a high level of performance accountability.
Strengthening our customer relationships | We market our services to both existing and new customers who value our broad geographic coverage, suite of transportation and logistics services, and industry-leading truckload capacity and freight lanes that complement our existing operations. We seek customers who will diversify our freight base. We market our dry van, refrigerated, drayage, brokerage, and intermodal services, including dedicated and cross-border services within those offerings, to logistics customers seeking a single-source provider of multiple services but do not currently take advantage of our array of truckload solutions.
Improving asset productivity | We focus on improving the revenue generated from our tractors and trailers without compromising safety. We anticipate that we can accomplish this objective through increased miles driven and rate per mile. 
Acquiring and growing opportunistically | We regularly evaluate potential opportunities for mergers, acquisitions, and other development and growth opportunities. In addition to the merger between Knight and Swift in 2017, since 1999, Knight has acquired six short-to-medium haul truckload carriers, including the acquisitions of Barr-Nunn during 2014 and Abilene during 2018, and Swift has acquired fifteen companies since 1966. On February 1, 2021, Knight acquired a majority ownership position in Eleos, a Greenville, South Carolina based software provider, specializing in mobile driving workflow platforms. 
Expanding existing terminals | Historically, a substantial portion of our revenue growth has been generated by our expansion into new geographic regions through the opening of additional terminals. Although we continue to seek opportunities to further increase our business in this manner, our primary focus is on developing and expanding our existing terminals by strengthening our customer relationships, recruiting qualified driving associates and non-driver employees, adding new customers, and expanding the range of transportation and logistics solutions offered from these terminals. 
Diversifying our service offerings | We are committed to providing our customers a broad and growing range of truckload and logistics services and continue to invest considerable resources toward developing a range of solutions for our customers. We believe that these offerings contribute meaningfully to our results and reflect our strategy to bring complementary services to our customers to assist them with their supply chain needs. We plan to continue to leverage our nationwide footprint and expertise to add value to our customers through our diversified service offerings. 


Customers and Marketing

Marketing
Our marketing mission is to be a strategic, efficient transportation capacity partner for our customers by providing truckload and logistics solutions customizable to the unique needs of our customers. We deliver these capacity solutions through our network of owned assets, independent contractors, third-party capacity providers, and rail providers. The diverse and premium services we offer provide a comprehensive approach to providing ample supply chain solutions to our customers. At December 31, 2020, we had a sales staff of approximately 100 individuals across the US and Mexico, who work closely with management to establish and expand accounts. Our sales and marketing leaders are members of our senior management team, who are assisted by other sales professionals in each segment. Our sales team emphasizes our industry-leading service, environmental leadership, and our ability to accommodate a variety of customer needs, provide consistent capacity, and financial strength and stability.
Customers
Our customers are typically large corporations in the retail (including discount and online retail), food and beverage, consumer products, paper products, transportation and logistics, housing and building, automotive, and manufacturing industries. Many of our customers have extensive operations, geographically distributed locations, and diverse shipping needs. 
Consistent with industry practice, our typical customer contracts (other than dedicated contracts) do not guarantee shipment volumes by our customers or truck availability by us. This affords us and our customers some flexibility to negotiate rates in response to changes in freight demand and industry-wide truck capacity. Our dedicated services within the Trucking segment assign particular driving associates and revenue equipment to prescribed routes, 
 Glossary of Terms
KNIGHT-SWIFT TRANSPORTATION HOLDINGS INC.

pursuant to multi-year agreements. This dedicated service provides individual customers with a guaranteed source of capacity, and allows our driving associates to have more predictable schedules and routes. Under our dedicated transportation services, we provide driving associates, equipment, maintenance, and, in some instances, transportation management services that supplement the customer's in-house transportation department. 
A majority of our terminals are linked to our corporate information technology system in our Phoenix headquarters. The capabilities of this system and its software enhance our operating efficiency by providing cost-effective access to detailed information concerning equipment location and availability, shipment tracking, on-time delivery status, and other specific customer requirements. The system also enables us to respond promptly and accurately to customer requests and assists us in geographically matching available equipment with customer loads. Additionally, our customers can track shipments and obtain copies of shipping documents via our website. We also provide electronic data interchange services to customers desiring these services. 
We believe our fleet capacity, terminal network, customer service and breadth of services offer a competitive advantage to major shippers, particularly in times of rising freight volumes when shippers must quickly access capacity across multiple facilities and regions.
We strive to maintain a diversified customer base. Services provided to our largest customer generated 16.8% and 13.3% of total revenue in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Revenue generated by our largest customer is reported in each of our reportable operating segments. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue in 2020 or 2019.
Our top 25 customers drive a substantial portion of our total revenue, as follows:
•In 2020, our top 25, top 10, and top 5 customers accounted for 56.5%, 40.8%, and 30.7% of our total revenue, respectively.
•In 2019, our top 25, top 10, and top 5 customers accounted for 49.7%, 33.5%, and 25.5% of our total revenue, respectively.

Revenue Equipment

We operate a modern fleet of company tractors to help attract and retain driving associates, promote safe operations, and reduce maintenance and repair costs.
In 2020, we obtained the majority of our revenue equipment through cash purchases, and in the future, we will continue to monitor leasing opportunities. We typically obtain tractors and trailers manufactured to our specifications in order to meet a wide variety of customer needs. Growth of our tractor and trailer fleet is determined by market conditions and our experience and expectations regarding equipment utilization. In acquiring revenue equipment, we consider a number of factors, including economy, price, rate, economic environment, technology, warranty terms, manufacturer support, driving associate comfort, and resale value. We maintain strong relationships with our equipment vendors and have the financial flexibility to react as market conditions dictate. 
Our current approach is to replace our tractors between 36 months and 60 months after purchase and to replace our trailers over a seven- to fifteen-year period. Changes in the current market for used tractors and trailers, regulatory changes, and difficult market conditions faced by tractor and trailer manufacturers, may result in price increases that may affect the period of time for which we operate our equipment.
Our newer equipment has enhanced features, which we believe tends to lower the overall life cycle costs by reducing safety-related expenses, lowering repair and maintenance expenses, improving fuel economy, and improving driving associate satisfaction. In 2021 and beyond, we will continue to monitor the appropriateness of this relatively short tractor trade-in cycle against the lower capital expenditure and financing costs of a longer tractor trade-in cycle, based on current and future business needs.

Human Capital

Employees
The strength of our company is our people, working together with common goals. There were approximately 22,700 full-time employees in our total headcount of approximately 22,900 employees as of December 31, 2020, which was comprised of:

Company driving associates (including driver trainees) | 17,400
Technicians and other equipment maintenance personnel | 1,200 
Corporate and terminal leadership and support personnel | 4,300 
Total | 22,900

As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 900 Trans-Mex driving associates in Mexico that were represented by a union.
Company Driving Associates
We recognize that the recruitment, training, and retention of a professional driving associate workforce, which is one of our most valuable assets, is essential to our continued growth and meeting the service requirements of our customers. In order to attract and retain safe driving associates who are committed to the highest levels of customer service and safety, we focus our operations for driving associates around a collaborative and supportive team environment. To help retain employees we provide late model and comfortable equipment, direct communication with senior management, competitive wages and benefits, and other incentives designed to encourage driving associate safety, retention, and long-term employment. Some examples of these incentive programs include our Million Miler, military apprenticeship, and Drive for a Degree programs. To help recruit drivers, we have established various driving academies across the US. Our academies are strategically located in areas where external driver-training organizations were lacking. In other areas of the US, we have contracted with driver training schools, which are managed by third parties. There are certain minimum qualifications for candidates to be accepted into the academy, including passing the DOT physical examination and drug/alcohol screening.
Terminal Staff
Most of our large terminals are staffed with terminal leaders, fleet leaders, driver leaders, planners, safety coordinators, shop leaders, technicians, and customer service representatives. Our terminal leaders work with driver leaders, customer service representatives, and other operations personnel to coordinate the needs of both our customers and our driving associates. Terminal leaders are also responsible for serving existing customers in their areas. Fleet leaders supervise driver leaders, who are responsible for the general operation of our trucks and their driving associates, focusing on driving associate retention, productivity per truck, fuel consumption, fuel efficiency (with respect to driver-controllable idle time), safety, and scheduled maintenance. Customer service representatives are assigned specific customers to ensure specialized, high-quality service, and frequent customer contact.
Diversity and Inclusion
We are committed to fostering a diverse workforce and an inclusive environment, which among other things, is supported by our hiring practices, employee training programs, formal and informal diversity and inclusion networks, as well as our employee resource group. Our employee resource group, sponsored and supported by leadership, is integral to ensuring different voices and perspectives contribute to our strategy for long term profitable growth.
Succession Planning and Talent Management
We regularly review talent development and succession plans to identify and develop a pipeline of talent to maintain business operations. We understand the potential costs and risks of bringing in an outside executive officer in today’s environment, and that businesses are often, but not always, more successful in promoting internal candidates. Accordingly, the Board makes an effort to identify potential successors for those positions long in advance of any potential positional vacancies, perform skills gap analyses for those internal candidates, and provide training and exposure on those gap areas to those candidates in order to develop better potential successors. The Board is primarily responsible for succession planning for the CEO, but also participates in succession planning discussions for other executive officer positions. We believe that our culture, compensation structure, long-term 
 Glossary of Terms
KNIGHT-SWIFT TRANSPORTATION HOLDINGS INC.

equity program, and robust training and development program provide motivation for talented leaders to remain with the Company.
Independent Contractors
In addition to Knight-Swift-employed driving associates, we enter into contractor agreements with third parties who own and operate tractors (or hire their own driving associates to operate the tractors) that service our customers. We pay these independent contractors for their services, based on a contracted rate per mile. By operating safely and productively, independent contractors can improve their own profitability and ours. Independent contractors are responsible for most costs incurred for owning and operating their tractors. In 2020, independent contractors comprised 10.9% of our total fleet, as measured by average tractor count. 

Safety and Insurance

Safety
We are committed to safe and secure operations. We conduct an intensive driver qualification process, including defensive driving training. We require prospective drivers to meet higher qualification standards than those required by the DOT, including extensive background checks and hair follicle drug testing. We regularly communicate with drivers to promote safety and instill safe work habits through effective use of various media and safety review sessions. We dedicate personnel and resources designed to ensure safe operation and regulatory compliance. We employ technology to assist us in managing risks associated with our business. We have event recorders in all of our tractors, which are used daily by drivers and operations leaders to provide feedback and coaching in regard to driving behaviors. In addition, we have an innovative recognition program for driver safety performance and emphasize safety through our equipment specifications and maintenance programs. Our Corporate Directors of Safety review all accidents and report weekly to leadership. 
Insurance
The primary claims arising in our business consist of auto liability, including personal injury, property damage, physical damage, and cargo loss. We self-insure for a significant portion of our claims exposure and related expenses. We also maintain insurance that covers our directors and officers for losses and expenses arising out of claims, based on acts or omissions in their capacities as directors or officers. While under dispatch and our operating authority, the independent contractors we contract with are covered by our liability coverage and self-insurance retention limits. However, each is responsible for physical damage to his or her own equipment, occupational accident coverage, and liability exposure while the truck is used for non-company purposes. Additionally, fleet operators are responsible for any applicable workers' compensation requirements for their employees.
We insure certain casualty risks through our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries, Mohave and Red Rock. Mohave and Red Rock provide reinsurance associated with a share of our automobile liability risk. In addition to insuring a proportionate share of our corporate casualty risk, Mohave provides reinsurance coverage to third-party insurance companies associated with our affiliated companies' independent contractors.
Please refer to Note 13 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information about our insurance policies and self-insurance retention limits.

Fuel

We actively manage our fuel purchasing network in an effort to maintain adequate fuel supplies and reduce our fuel costs. Additionally, we utilize a fuel surcharge program to pass a majority of increases in fuel costs to our customers. In 2020, we purchased 12.3% of our fuel in bulk at our Swift, Knight, and dedicated customer locations across the US and Mexico. We purchased substantially all of the remainder through a network of retail truck stops with which we have negotiated volume purchasing discounts. The volumes we purchase at terminals and through the fuel network vary based on procurement costs and other factors. We seek to reduce our fuel costs by routing our driving associates to truck stops when fuel prices at such stops are cheaper than the bulk rate paid for fuel at our terminals. We primarily store fuel in above-ground storage tanks at most of our other bulk fueling terminals. We believe that we are sufficiently in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations relating to the storage and dispensing of fuel.
 Glossary of Terms
KNIGHT-SWIFT TRANSPORTATION HOLDINGS INC.


Seasonality

See Note 1 in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report, regarding the impact of seasonality on our operations. 

Environmental Regulation

General
We have bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at many of our terminals, as well as vehicle maintenance, repair, and washing operations at some of our facilities, which exposes us to certain environmental risks. Soil and groundwater contamination have occurred at some of our facilities in prior years, for which we have been responsible for remediating the environmental contamination. Also, a small percentage of our total shipments contain hazardous materials, which are generally rated as low to medium-risk, and subject us to a wide array of regulation. In the past, we have been responsible for the costs of clean-up of cargo and diesel fuel spills caused by traffic accidents or other events.
We have instituted programs to monitor and mitigate environmental risks and maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws governing the hauling, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials, fuel spillage or seepage, emissions from our vehicles and facilities, engine-idling, discharge and retention of storm water, and other environmental matters. As part of our safety and risk management program, we periodically perform internal environmental reviews. We are a Charter Partner in the EPA's SmartWay Transport Partnership, a voluntary program promoting energy efficiency and air quality. We believe that our operations are in material compliance with current laws and regulations and do not know of any existing environmental condition that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results.
If we are held responsible for the cleanup of any environmental incidents or conditions caused by our operations or business, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to clean-up costs and other liabilities, including substantial fines, penalties and/or civil and criminal liability, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We have paid penalties for spills and violations in the past; however, they have not been material to our financial results or position.
Greenhouse Gas ("GHG") Emissions and Fuel Efficiency Standards
California ARB — In 2008, the State of California's Air Resources Board ("ARB") approved the Heavy-Duty Vehicle GHG Emission Reduction Regulation in efforts to reduce GHG emissions from certain long-haul tractor-trailers that operate in California by requiring them to utilize technologies that improve fuel efficiency (regardless of where the vehicle is registered). The regulation, which became effective in 2010, required owners of long-haul tractors and 53-foot trailers to be EPA SmartWay certified or replace or retrofit their vehicles with aerodynamic technologies and low-rolling resistance tires. The regulation also contained certain emissions and registration standards for refrigerated trailers.
In February 2018, California's ARB approved California Phase 2 standards that generally align with the federal Phase 2 standards, with some minor additional requirements, and which would stay in place even if the federal Phase 2 standards are affected by action from President Trump's administration.  In February 2019, the California Phase 2 standards became final. 
In June 2020, ARB passed the Advanced Clean Trucks (“ACT”) regulation, requiring original equipment manufacturers to begin shifting towards greater production of zero-emission heavy duty tractors starting in 2024. Under ACT, by 2045, every new tractor sold in California will need to be zero-emission. While ACT does not apply to those simply operating tractors in California, it could affect the cost and/or supply of traditional diesel tractors and may lead to similar legislation in other states or at the federal level.
EPA and NHTSA — The EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ("NHTSA") have begun taking coordinated steps in support of a new generation of clean vehicles and engines through reduced GHG emissions and improved fuel efficiency at a national level. In September 2011, the EPA finalized the Phase 1 federal regulations for controlling GHG emissions, related to efficient engines, use of auxiliary power units, mass reduction, low-rolling resistance tires, improved aerodynamics, improved transmissions, and reduced accessory loads. 
 Glossary of Terms
KNIGHT-SWIFT TRANSPORTATION HOLDINGS INC.

•Phase 2 — In August 2016, the EPA and NHTSA announced the final rule regarding Phase 2, which builds upon Phase 1, and would apply to certain trailer types beginning with model-year 2018 for EPA standards (voluntary for NHTSA standards through model-year 2020). Tractors and certain trailer types would be subject to the Phase 2 standards beginning with model-year 2021, increasing in stringency through model-year 2024, and phasing in completely by model-year 2027. This rule marks the first time federal mandates will be applied to trailers, with respect to aerodynamics and low-rolling resistance tires. The final rule was effective in December 2016.
Additionally, implementation of the Phase 2 standards as they relate to trailers has been delayed due to a provisional stay granted in October 2017 by the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which is overseeing a case against the EPA by the Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association, Inc. regarding the Phase 2 standards. If the glider provisions are removed from the Phase 2 standards as the EPA has proposed in the past, there would be no direct effect on our results of operations. If the trailer provisions of the Phase 2 standards are permanently removed, we would still need to ensure the majority of our fleet is compliant with the California Phase 2 standards.
In January 2020, the EPA announced it is seeking input on reducing emissions of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants from heavy-duty trucks. The EPA is aiming to release proposed rulemaking for the new plan, commonly referred to as the “Cleaner Trucks Initiative,” in 2021. The EPA is targeting 2027 for these new standards to take effect. 
Complying with these and any future GHG regulations enacted by California’s ARB, the EPA, the NHTSA and/or any other state or federal governing body has increased and will likely continue to increase the cost of our new tractors, may increase the cost of new trailers, may require us to retrofit certain of our trailers, may increase our maintenance costs, and could impair equipment productivity and increase our operating costs, particularly if such costs are not offset by potential fuel savings. These adverse effects, combined with the uncertainty as to the reliability of the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values of our equipment, could materially increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations. We cannot predict, however, the extent to which our operations and productivity will be impacted. We will continue monitoring our compliance with federal and state GHG regulations.
Climate-change Proposals
Federal and state lawmakers are considering a variety of other climate-change proposals related to carbon emissions and GHG emissions. The proposals could potentially limit carbon emissions within certain states and municipalities, which continue to restrict the location and amount of time that diesel-powered tractors (like ours) may idle. 
These restrictions could force us to purchase on-board power units that do not require the engine to idle or to alter our driving associates' behavior, which could result in a decrease in productivity, or increase in driving associate turnover.

Industry Regulation

Our operations are regulated and licensed by various federal, state, and local government agencies in North America, including the DOT, the FMCSA, and the US Department of Homeland Security, among others. Our company, as well as our driving associates and independent contractors, must comply with enacted governmental regulations regarding safety, equipment, and operating methods. Examples include regulation of equipment weight, equipment dimensions, driver hours-of-service, driver eligibility requirements, on-board reporting of operations, and ergonomics. The following discussion presents recently enacted federal, state, and local regulations that could have an impact on our operations.
Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Bill
In July 2012, Congress passed the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century bill into law. Included in the highway bill was a provision that mandates electronic logging devices in commercial motor vehicles to record hours-of-service. Additionally, in response to the bill, a final rule related to entry-level driver training was passed in 2016, as well as amendments to the Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse rules.

ELD — During 2012, the FMCSA published a Supplemental NPRM, announcing its plan to proceed with the ELDs and hours-of-service supporting documents rulemaking. The ELD rule became final in December 2015, as published in the Federal Register, with an effective date in February 2016. The ELD rule phased in over a four-year period, with all drivers and carriers subject to the rule being required to use certified and registered ELDs that comply with the requirements of the ELD regulations by December 16, 2019.
Although the final ELD rule may have caused many carriers to experience at least a short-term drop in production and has had a significant impact on the industry as a whole, we have not experienced any adverse effects, as we had installed ELDs in our operational trucks well before the requisite compliance dates in conjunction with our efforts to improve efficiency and communications with driving associates and independent contractors. However, we believe that more effective hours-of-service enforcement under the ELD rule may improve our competitive position by causing all carriers to adhere more closely to hours-of-service requirements.
Commercial Driver's License Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse — In December 2016, the FMCSA amended the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations to establish requirements of the Commercial Driver's License Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse, a database under its administration containing information about violations of the FMCSA's drug and alcohol testing program for holders of commercial driver's licenses. The final rule became effective in January 2017, with a compliance date in January 2020. In December 2019, however, the FMCSA announced a final rule extending by three years the date for state driver’s licensing agencies to comply with certain requirements. The December 2016 commercial driver’s license rule required states to request information from the Clearinghouse about individuals prior to issuing, renewing, upgrading or transferring a commercial driver's license. This new action will allow states’ compliance with the requirement, which was set to begin January 2020, to be delayed until January 2023. The compliance date of January 2020 remained in place for all other requirements set forth in the Clearinghouse final rule, however. Upon implementation, the rule may reduce the number of available drivers in an already constrained driver market.
In September 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”) announced proposed mandatory guidelines to allow employers to drug test truck drivers and other federal workers for pre-employment and random testing using hair specimens. However, the proposal also requires a second sample using either urine or an oral swab test if a hair test is positive, if a donor is unable to provide a sufficient amount of hair for faith-based or medical reasons, or due to an insufficient amount or length of hair. DHHS indicated the two-test approach is intended to protect federal workers from issues that have been identified as limitations of hair testing, and related legal deficiencies identified in prior court cases. The American Trucking Associations (“ATA”) has voiced concerns with the new guidelines, taking particular issue with the second sample requirement, which the ATA feels diminishes the value of hair testing. It is unclear if and when a final rule may be put in place. Any final rule may reduce the number of available drivers. We currently perform hair follicle testing and will continue to monitor any developments in this area to ensure compliance.

Entry-Level Driver Training — In December 2016, the FMCSA established new minimum training standards for certain individuals applying for (or upgrading) a Class A or Class B commercial driver's license, or obtaining a hazardous materials, passenger, or school bus endorsement on their commercial driver's license for the first time. Such individuals are subject to the entry-level driver training requirements and must complete a prescribed program of theory and behind-the-wheel instruction. The final rule requires that behind-the-wheel proficiency of an entry-level truck driver be determined solely by the instructor's evaluation of how well the driver-trainee performs the fundamental vehicle controls skills and driving procedures set forth in the curricula, but does not have a minimum training hours requirement, as proposed by the FMCSA earlier in 2016. The final rule went into effect in February 2017, with an initial compliance date in February 2020. However, in May 2020, the FMCSA approved an interim rule delaying implementation of the final rule by two years, extending the compliance date to February 2022. Upon the compliance date, training schools will be required to register with the FMCSA's Training Provider Registry and certify that their program meets the classroom and driving standards. We will also be required to comply with this rule in the course of operating our driving schools. The effect of this rule could result in a decrease in fleet production and driver availability, either of which could adversely affect our business or operations. US Congressional representatives also proposed a bill in 2019 that would pave the way for commercial drivers younger than 21 to drive tractors across state lines. This bill, which would lower the age requirement of 21 to 18 for interstate commercial driving if certain requirements are met, received support from the ATA during a February 2020 Senate hearing. It is unclear how long the process of finalizing such a bill will take, however if one comes to fruition at all. Meanwhile, the FMCSA announced in September 2020 that it is proposing and seeking public comments on a new pilot program to allow drivers aged 18, 19, and 20 to operate commercial motor vehicles in interstate commerce.
Hours-of-service
From time to time, the FMCSA proposes and implements changes to regulations impacting hours-of-service. Such changes can negatively impact our productivity and affect our operations and profitability by reducing the number of hours per day or week our driving associates and independent contractors may operate and/or disrupting our network. No such changes are currently proposed. However, in August 2019, the FMCSA issued a proposal to make changes to its hours-of-service rules that would allow truck drivers more flexibility with their 30-minute rest break and with dividing their time in the sleeper berth. It also would extend by two hours the duty time for drivers encountering adverse weather and extend the shorthaul exemption by lengthening the drivers’ maximum on-duty period from 12 hours to 14 hours. In June 2020 the FMCSA adopted a final rule substantially as proposed, which became effective September 2020. Any future changes to hours-of-service regulations could materially and adversely affect our operations and profitability.
Safety and Fitness Ratings
There are currently two methods of evaluating the safety and fitness of carriers: CSA, which evaluates and ranks fleets on certain safety-related standards by analyzing data from recent safety events and investigation results, and the DOT safety rating, which is based on an on-site investigation and affects a carrier's ability to operate in interstate commerce. Additionally, the FMCSA has proposed rules in the past that would change the methodologies used to determine carrier safety and fitness. 
DOT Safety Rating — The DOT safety rating is currently the only safety measurement system that has a direct impact on a carrier's ability to operate in interstate commerce. Both Knight and Swift currently have a satisfactory DOT safety rating, which is the best available rating under the current safety rating scale. If we were to receive a conditional or unsatisfactory DOT safety rating, it could adversely affect our business, as some of our existing customer contracts require a satisfactory DOT safety rating.
CSA — In December 2010, the FMCSA introduced CSA, an enforcement and compliance model that ranks on seven categories of safety-related data. The seven categories of safety-related data, currently include Unsafe Driving, Hours-of-Service Compliance, Driver Fitness, Controlled Substances/Alcohol, Vehicle Maintenance, Hazardous Materials Compliance, and Crash Indicator, (such categories known as "BASICs").  Carriers are grouped by category with other carriers that have a similar number of safety events (i.e. crashes, inspections, or violations) and carriers are ranked and assigned a rating percentile or score to prioritize them for interventions if they are above a certain threshold.
Certain CSA scores were initially published and made available to the general public. However, in December 2015, as part of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation ("FAST") Act, Congress mandated that the FMCSA remove all CSA scores from public view until a more comprehensive study regarding the effectiveness of CSA improving

truck safety could be completed. Although the FMCSA has since provided a report to Congress outlining the changes it may make to the CSA program, it remains unclear if, when, and to what extent any such changes will occur. However, any changes that increase the likelihood of us receiving unfavorable scores could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.
In May 2020 the FMCSA announced that effective immediately it is making permanent a pilot program that will not count a crash in which a motor carrier was not at fault when calculating the carrier’s safety measurement profile, called the Crash Preventability Demonstration Program (“CPDP”). The CPDP will expand the types of eligible crashes, modify the Safety Measurement System to exclude crashes with not preventable determinations from the prioritization algorithm and note the not preventable determinations in the Pre-Employment Screening Program. 
CSA scores do not currently have a direct impact on a carrier's safety rating.  However, the occurrence of unfavorable scores in one or more categories may affect driving associate recruiting and retention by causing qualified driving associates to seek employment with other carriers, cause our customers to direct their business away from us and to carriers with more favorable scores, subjecting us to an increase in compliance reviews and roadside inspections, or cause us to incur greater than expected expenses in our attempts to improve unfavorable scores, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.
Safety Fitness Determination — In January 2016, the FMCSA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ("NPRM") in the Federal Register, regarding carrier safety fitness determination. The NPRM proposed new methodologies that would have determined when a motor carrier was not fit to operate a commercial motor vehicle. Based on public feedback and other concerns raised by industry stakeholders, in March 2017, the FMCSA withdrew the NPRM related to the new safety rating system. In its notice of withdrawal, the FMCSA noted that a new rulemaking related to a similar process may be initiated in the future. Therefore, it is uncertain if, when, or under what form any such rule could be implemented. The FMCSA also recently indicated its intent to perform a new study on the causation of crashes. Although it remains unclear whether such a study will ultimately be undertaken and completed, the results of such a study could spur further proposed and/or final rules in regards to safety and fitness.
Prohibiting Coercion of Commercial Motor Vehicle Drivers
In November 2015, the Prohibiting Coercion of Commercial Motor Vehicle Drivers rule became final. The rule explicitly prohibits motor carriers from coercing drivers to violate certain FMCSA regulations, including driver hours-of-service limits, Commercial Drivers' License regulations, drug and alcohol testing rules, and hazardous materials regulations, among others. Under the rule, drivers can report incidents of coercion to the FMCSA, who is authorized to issue penalties against the motor carrier. We have not experienced any significant impacts from this rule.
Speed Limiting Devices
In June 2019, legislation was introduced that would require all new commercial trucks with a gross weight of 26,001 pounds or more to be equipped with speed-limiting devices, which must be set to a maximum speed of 65 miles per hour and be used at all times while in operation. The maximum speed requirement would also be extended to existing trucks that already have the technology installed. Whether this legislation will ultimately become law is uncertain. While we currently govern the speed of our company tractors below these limits, such legislation could result in a decrease in fleet production and driver availability, either of which could adversely affect our business or operations.
For safety, we electronically govern the speed of substantially all of our company tractors. Additionally, our independent contractor agreements include statements that independent contractors must comply with the Company's speed policy.

Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 ("FSMA")
In April 2016, the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") published a final rule establishing requirements for shippers, loaders, carriers by motor vehicle and rail vehicle, and receivers engaged in the transportation of food, to use sanitary transportation practices to ensure the safety of the food they transport as part of the FSMA. This rule sets forth requirements related to among other things, equipment used to transport food, measures taken during such transportation, personnel training, and record retention. These requirements took effect for larger carriers such as us in April 2017 and are also applicable when we perform as a carrier or as a broker. We believe we have been in compliance with these requirements since that time. However, if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations related to the FSMA, or if we transport food or goods that are contaminated or are found to cause illness and/or death, we could be subject to substantial fines, lawsuits, penalties and/or criminal and civil liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
As the FDA continues its efforts to modernize food safety, it is likely additional food safety regulations will take effect in the future. In July 2020, the FDA released its “New Era of Smarter Food Safety” blueprint, which creates a ten year roadmap to create a more digital, traceable and safer food system. This blueprint builds on the work done under the FSMA, and while it is still unclear what, if any, changes to the current governing framework may ultimately take effect, further regulation in this area could negatively affect our business by increasing our compliance obligations and related expenses going forward. 
Legislation Regarding Independent Contractors
Tax and other regulatory authorities have sought in the past to assert that independent contractors in the trucking industry are employees rather than independent contractors.  Federal legislators continue to introduce legislation concerning the classification of independent contractors as employees, including legislation that proposes to increase the tax and labor penalties against employers who intentionally or unintentionally misclassify employees as independent contractors and are found to have violated employees' overtime or wage requirements.  Additionally, federal legislators have sought to:
•abolish the current safe harbor allowing taxpayers meeting certain criteria to treat individuals as independent contractors if they are following a long-standing, recognized practice,
•extend the FLSA to independent contractors, and
•impose notice requirements based upon employment or independent contractor status and fines for failure to comply.  
Some states have adopted initiatives to increase their revenues from items such as unemployment, workers' compensation, and income taxes, and we believe a reclassification of independent contractors as employees would help states with this initiative.  Federal and state taxing and other regulatory authorities and courts apply a variety of standards in their determination of independent contractor status.
Recently, courts in certain states have issued decisions that could result in a greater likelihood that independent contractors would be judicially classified as employees in such states. Further, class actions and other lawsuits have been filed against us and other members of our industry seeking to reclassify independent contractors as employees for a variety of purposes, including workers' compensation and health care coverage. Our defense of such class actions and other lawsuits has not always been successful, and we have been subject to adverse judgments with respect to such matters. In addition, carriers such as us that operate or have operated lease-purchase programs have been more susceptible to lawsuits seeking to reclassify independent contractors that have engaged in such programs.  If our independent contractors were determined to be our employees, we would incur additional exposure under federal and state tax, workers' compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment, and tort laws, which could potentially include prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings.  We currently observe and monitor our compliance with current related and applicable laws and regulations, but we cannot predict whether future laws and regulations, judicial decisions, or settlements regarding the classification of independent contractors will adversely affect our business or operations.
In September 2019, California enacted A.B. 5 ("AB5"), a new law that changed the landscape of the state’s treatment of employees and independent contractors. AB5 provides that the three-pronged "ABC Test" must be used to determine worker classification in wage-order claims. Under the ABC Test, a worker is presumed to be an employee and the burden to demonstrate their independent contractor status is on the hiring company through satisfying all three of the following criteria:
 Glossary of Terms
KNIGHT-SWIFT TRANSPORTATION HOLDINGS INC.

•the worker is free from control and direction in the performance of services;
•the worker is performing work outside the usual course of the business of the hiring company;
•the worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business.
How AB5 will be enforced is still to be determined. In January 2021, however, the California Supreme Court ruled that the ABC Test could apply retroactively to all cases not yet final as of the date the original decision was rendered, April 30, 2018. While it was set to go into effect in January 2020, a federal judge in California issued a preliminary injunction barring the enforcement of AB5 on the trucking industry while the California Trucking Association ("CTA") moves forward with its suit seeking to invalidate AB5. While this preliminary injunction provides temporary relief to the enforcement of AB5, it remains unclear how long such relief will last, and whether the CTA will ultimately be successful in invalidating the law. It is also possible AB5 will spur similar legislation in states other than California, which could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability. In September 2020, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit heard oral arguments in the case to decide whether the preliminary injunction prohibiting the state from enforcing the ABC Test against motor carriers should remain in effect. A decision on the matter is expected soon. Meanwhile, in November 2020, a California state appeals court ruled that the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act (“FAAAA”) does not preempt application of the ABC Test to truck drivers. Because this opinion came from a California state court, however, it does not directly impact the Ninth Circuit decision discussed above. 
State Wage and Hour Legislation
In December 2018, the FMCSA granted a petition filed by the American Trucking Associations and in doing so determined that federal law does preempt California’s wage and hour laws, and interstate truck drivers are not subject to such laws. The FMCSA’s decision has been appealed by labor groups and multiple lawsuits have been filed in federal courts seeking to overturn the decision, and while the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has since upheld the FMCSA’s decision, it still remains uncertain whether it will stand. Other current and future state and local wage and hour laws, including laws related to employee meal breaks and rest periods, may also vary significantly from federal law. Further, driver piece rate compensation, which is an industry standard, has been attacked as non-compliant with state minimum wage laws. Both of these issues are adversely impacting the Company and the industry as a whole, with respect to the practical application of the laws, thereby resulting in additional cost. As a result, we are subject to an uneven patchwork of wage and hour laws throughout the US. If federal legislation is not passed preempting state and local wage and hour laws, we will either need to comply with the most restrictive state and local laws across our entire fleet, or revise our management systems to comply with varying state and local laws. Either solution could result in increased compliance costs, increased driver turnover, decreased efficiency, and amplified legal exposure.

Other Regulation

Executive Order
It is still to be determined how President Biden’s leadership will impact our industry. That being said, President Biden has indicated his intent to make a green infrastructure package a top priority for his administration. Any measure in furtherance thereof could draw from the Moving Forward Act, a $1.5 trillion infrastructure bill that passed the US House of Representatives in June 2020, but is still waiting to be heard by the US Senate. The Moving Forward Act incorporated and expanded upon the Investing in a New Vision for the Environment and Surface Transportation in America (INVEST in America) Act, a nearly $500 billion bill intended to rebuild and reimagine US transportation and infrastructure that was passed out of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure in June 2020. It is unclear whether these legislative initiatives will be signed into law and what changes they may undergo prior thereto. However, adoption and implementation of the same could negatively impact our business by increasing our compliance obligations and related expenses.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
In December 2017, the US enacted significant changes to its tax law following the passage and signing of H.R.1, "An Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018" (previously known as "The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"). The longevity of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act remains unclear, however, with President Biden indicating an intention to make substantial changes to the current US tax structure during his administration, including changes to the way capital gains are treated. Any changes to US tax laws may have an adverse impact on our business and profitability. 
US-Mexico-Canada Agreement
The US-Mexico-Canada Agreement ("USMCA") was entered into effect in July 2020. The USMCA is designed to modernize food and agriculture trade, advance rules of origin for automobiles and trucks, and enhance intellectual property protections, among other matters, according to the Office of the US Trade Representative. It is difficult to predict at this stage what could be the impact of the USMCA on the economy, including the transportation industry. However, given the amount of North American trade that moves by truck, it could have a significant impact on supply and demand in the transportation industry, and could adversely impact the amount, movement, and patterns of freight we transport. 
FAST Act
With the FAST Act originally scheduled to expire in September 2020, Congress had noted its intent to consider a multiyear highway measure that would update the FAST Act. However, in September 2020 Congress approved a one year extension of the FAST Act, now set to expire in September 2021. If Congress fails to reauthorize the FAST Act or pass updated replacement legislation by the September 2021 deadline and proceeds to manage transportation policy via short-term legislative directives, there will be uncertainty that could have a negative impact on our operations.
COVID-19
Given COVID-19’s considerable effect on the transportation industry in 2020, the FMCSA issued various temporary responsive measures throughout the year in order to combat the same, including, without limitation, those related to hours of service, commercial driver’s licenses, and medical certifications. Although, to date, these measures have largely been enacted in order to assist industry participants in operating under adverse circumstances, any further responsive measures remain unclear and could have a negative impact on our operations.
