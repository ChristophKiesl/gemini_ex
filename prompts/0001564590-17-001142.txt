Its telephone number is (330) 796-2121. The terms “Goodyear,” “Company” and “we,” “us” or “our” wherever used herein refer to the Company together with all of its consolidated U.S. and foreign subsidiary companies, unless the context indicates to the contrary.
We are one of the world’s leading manufacturers of tires, engaging in operations in most regions of the world. In 2016, our net sales were $15,158 million and Goodyear’s net income and net income available to common shareholders were $1,264 million. Together with our U.S. and international subsidiaries, we develop, manufacture, market and distribute tires for most applications. We also manufacture and market rubber-related chemicals for various applications. We are one of the world’s largest operators of commercial truck service and tire retreading centers. In addition, we operate approximately 1,100 tire and auto service center outlets where we offer our products for retail sale and provide automotive repair and other services. We manufacture our products in 48 manufacturing facilities in 21 countries, including the United States, and we have marketing operations in almost every country around the world. We employ approximately 66,000 full-time and temporary associates worldwide.
Dissolution of Global Alliance with Sumitomo Rubber Industries
On October 1, 2015, we completed the previously announced dissolution of our global alliance with Sumitomo Rubber Industries, Ltd. (“SRI”) in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Framework Agreement, dated as of June 4, 2015, by and between the Company and SRI. 
Under the global alliance, we owned 75% and SRI owned 25% of two companies, Goodyear Dunlop Tires Europe B.V. (“GDTE”) and Goodyear Dunlop Tires North America, Ltd. (“GDTNA”). In Japan, we owned 25% and SRI owned 75% of two companies, one, Nippon Goodyear Ltd. (“NGY”), for the sale of Goodyear-brand passenger and truck tires for replacement in Japan and the other, Dunlop Goodyear Tires Ltd. (“DGT”), for the sale of Goodyear-brand and Dunlop-brand tires to vehicle manufacturers in Japan. We also owned 51%, and SRI owned 49%, of a company that coordinated and disseminated both commercialized tire technology and non-commercialized technology among us and SRI, the joint ventures and their respective affiliates (the “Technology JV”), and we owned 80%, and SRI owned 20%, of a global purchasing company (the “Purchasing JV”). The global alliance also provided for the investment by us and SRI in the common stock of the other.
As result of the completion of the transactions contemplated by the Framework Agreement:

• | we acquired SRI’s 25% interest in GDTE and SRI’s 75% interest in NGY;


• | we sold to SRI our 75% interest in GDTNA, as well as the Huntsville, Alabama test track used by GDTNA, and our 25% interest in DGT;


• | we maintained control of the Dunlop-related trademarks for tire-related businesses in North America but granted to SRI an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and sell Dunlop-brand tires for motorcycles and for Japanese-owned original equipment manufacturers operating in North America;


• | SRI obtained exclusive rights to sell Dunlop-brand tires in those countries that were previously non-exclusive under the global alliance, including Russia, Turkey and certain countries in Africa;


• | we liquidated the Technology JV and Purchasing JV and distributed the remaining assets and liabilities of those entities to us and SRI in accordance with our respective ownership interests; and


• | we sold our investment in the common stock of SRI resulting in total proceeds of $47 million and a pre-tax gain of $30 million.

We paid to SRI a net amount of $271 million and delivered a promissory note to GDTNA in the initial principal amount of $56 million at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 0.1% and with a maturity date three years following the date of dissolution.
Deconsolidation of our Venezuelan Subsidiary
Effective December 31, 2015, we concluded that we did not meet the accounting criteria for control over our Venezuelan subsidiary. We deconsolidated the operations of our Venezuelan subsidiary and began reporting their results using the cost method of accounting. Our financial results for 2016 do not include the operating results of our Venezuelan subsidiary. Refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 1, Accounting Policies.

DESCRIPTION OF GOODYEAR’S BUSINESS
GENERAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR SEGMENTS
For the year ended December 31, 2016, we operated our business through three operating segments representing our regional tire businesses: Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia Pacific.
Financial information related to our operating segments for the three year period ended December 31, 2016 appears in the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 8, Business Segments.
Effective January 1, 2016, we combined our former North America and Latin America strategic business units into one Americas strategic business unit. We have combined the North America and Latin America reportable segments effective on this date to align with the new organizational structure and the basis used for reporting to our Chief Executive Officer. This 2016 Form 10-K reflects the new segment structure with prior periods recast for comparable disclosure.
Our principal business is the development, manufacture, distribution and sale of tires and related products and services worldwide. We manufacture and market numerous lines of rubber tires for:

• | automobiles


• | trucks


• | buses


• | aircraft


• | motorcycles


• | earthmoving and mining equipment


• | farm implements


• | industrial equipment, and


• | various other applications.

In each case, our tires are offered for sale to vehicle manufacturers for mounting as original equipment (“OE”) and for replacement worldwide. We manufacture and sell tires under the Goodyear, Dunlop, Kelly, Debica, Sava and Fulda brands and various other Goodyear owned “house” brands, and the private-label brands of certain customers. In certain geographic areas we also:

• | retread truck, aviation and off-the-road, or OTR, tires,


• | manufacture and sell tread rubber and other tire retreading materials,


• | sell chemical products, and


• | provide automotive and commercial repair services and miscellaneous other products and services.

Our principal products are new tires for most applications. Approximately 87% of our sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were for new tires. Sales of chemical products and natural rubber to unaffiliated customers were 3% in 2016, 2% in 2015 and 3% in 2014 of our consolidated sales (5%, 4% and 5% of Americas total sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively). The percentages of each segment’s sales attributable to new tires during the periods indicated were:

 | Year Ended December 31,
Sales of New Tires By | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
Americas | 82 | % | | 84 | % | 82 | %
Europe, Middle East and Africa | 94 | | | 94 | | 94 | 
Asia Pacific | 89 | | | 89 | | 88 | 

Each segment exports tires to other segments. The financial results of each segment exclude sales of tires exported to other segments, but include operating income derived from such transactions.
Goodyear does not include motorcycle, aviation or all-terrain vehicle tires in reported tire unit sales.

New tires are sold under highly competitive conditions throughout the world. On a worldwide basis, we have two major competitors: Bridgestone (based in Japan) and Michelin (based in France). Other significant competitors include Continental, Cooper, Hankook, Kumho, Pirelli, SRI, Toyo, Yokohama and various regional tire manufacturers.
We compete with other tire manufacturers on the basis of product design, performance, price and terms, reputation, warranty terms, customer service and consumer convenience. Goodyear and Dunlop brand tires enjoy a high recognition factor and have a reputation for performance and product design. The Kelly, Debica, Sava and Fulda brands and various house brand tire lines offered by us, and tires manufactured and sold by us to private brand customers, compete primarily on the basis of value and price.
We do not consider our tire businesses to be seasonal to any significant degree.
AMERICAS
Americas, our largest segment in terms of revenue, develops, manufactures, distributes and sells tires and related products and services in North, Central and South America, and sells tires to various export markets, primarily through intersegment sales. Americas manufactures tires in six plants in the United States, two plants in Canada and five plants in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela.

Americas is a major supplier of tires to most manufacturers of automobiles, trucks, buses, aircraft, and earthmoving, mining and industrial equipment that have production facilities located in the Americas.
Americas' primary competitors are Bridgestone and Michelin. Other significant competitors include Continental, Cooper, Pirelli, and imports from other regions, primarily Asia.
Goodyear, Dunlop and Kelly brand tires are sold in Americas through several channels of distribution. The principal channel for Goodyear brand tires is a large network of independent dealers. Goodyear, Dunlop and Kelly brand tires are also sold to numerous national and regional retailers and in Goodyear Company-owned stores in the United States. 
We are subject to regulation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), which has established various standards and regulations applicable to tires sold in the United States. NHTSA has the authority to order the recall of automotive products, including tires, having a defect related to motor vehicle safety or that do not comply with a motor vehicle safety standard. In addition, the Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation Act (the “TREAD Act”) imposes numerous reporting requirements with respect to tires. The TREAD Act also requires tire manufacturers, among other things, to remedy tire safety defects without charge for five years and comply with revised and more rigorous tire testing standards. NHTSA is also in the process of establishing national tire labeling regulations, under which certain tires sold in the United States will be required to be rated for rolling resistance, traction and tread wear.
In 2012, Brazil adopted a tire labeling regulation, which took effect in 2015 and set requirements for tire certification and labeling for rolling resistance, wet grip braking and noise for all radial passenger car, light truck and commercial truck tires sold in that country. 
EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Europe, Middle East and Africa, our second largest segment in terms of revenue, develops, manufactures, distributes and sells tires for automobiles, trucks, buses, aircraft, motorcycles, and earthmoving, mining and industrial equipment throughout Europe, the Middle East and Africa under the Goodyear, Dunlop, Debica, Sava and Fulda brands and other house brands, and sells tires to various export markets, primarily through intersegment sales.

GENERAL BUSINESS INFORMATION
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
The principal raw materials used by Goodyear are synthetic and natural rubber. Synthetic rubber accounts for approximately 60% of all rubber consumed by us on an annual basis. Our plants located in Beaumont and Houston, Texas supply a major portion of our global synthetic rubber requirements. We purchase all of our requirements for natural rubber in the world market.
Other important raw materials and components we use are carbon black, steel cord, fabrics and petrochemical-based commodities. Substantially all of these raw materials and components are purchased from independent suppliers, except for certain chemicals we manufacture. We purchase most raw materials and components in significant quantities from several suppliers, except in those instances where only one or a few qualified sources are available. We anticipate the continued availability of all raw materials and components we will require during 2017, subject to spot shortages and unexpected disruptions caused by natural disasters such as hurricanes and other similar events.
Substantial quantities of fuel and other petrochemical-based commodities are used in the production of tires, synthetic rubber and other products. Supplies of such fuels and commodities have been and are expected to continue to be available to us in quantities sufficient to satisfy our anticipated requirements, subject to spot shortages.
Patents and Trademarks
We own approximately 1,900 product, process and equipment patents issued by the United States Patent Office and approximately 3,600 patents issued or granted in other countries around the world. We have approximately 400 applications for United States patents pending and approximately 1,900 patent applications on file in other countries around the world. While such patents and patent applications as a group are important, we do not consider any patent or patent application to be of such importance that the loss or expiration thereof would materially affect Goodyear or any business segment.
We own, control or use approximately 1,500 different trademarks, including several using the word “Goodyear” or the word “Dunlop.” Approximately 13,300 registrations and 500 pending applications worldwide protect these trademarks. While such trademarks as a group are important, the only trademarks we consider material to our business, or to the business of any of our segments, are those using the word “Goodyear,” and with respect to certain of our international business segments, those using the word “Dunlop.” We believe our trademarks are valid and most are of unlimited duration as long as they are adequately protected and appropriately used.
Backlog
Our backlog of orders is not considered material to, or a significant factor in, evaluating and understanding any of our business segments or our businesses considered as a whole.

Research and Development
Our direct and indirect expenditures on research, development and certain engineering activities relating to the design, development and significant modification of new and existing products and services and the formulation and design of new, and significant improvements to existing, manufacturing processes and equipment during the periods indicated were:

 | Year Ended December 31,
(In millions) | 2016 | 2015 | 2014
Research and development expenditures | $388 | $382 | $399

Employees
At December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 66,000 full-time and temporary people throughout the world, including approximately 37,000 people covered under collective bargaining agreements. Approximately 6,800 of our employees in the United States are covered by a master collective bargaining agreement with the United Steelworkers ("USW"), which expires in July 2017. Approximately 16,000 of our employees outside of the United States are covered by union contracts that currently have expired or that will expire in 2017, primarily in Brazil, Poland, China and France. In addition, approximately 1,000 of our employees in the United States are covered by other contracts with the USW and various other unions. Unions also represent the major portion of our employees in Europe.
Compliance with Environmental Regulations
We are subject to extensive regulation under environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations relate to, among other things, air emissions, discharges to surface and underground waters and the generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste materials and hazardous substances. We have several continuing programs designed to ensure compliance with Federal, state and local environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations. We expect capital expenditures for pollution control facilities and occupational safety and health projects to be $40 million to $50 million annually in 2017 and 2018.
We also incur ongoing expenses to maintain and operate our pollution control facilities and conduct our other environmental activities, including the control and disposal of hazardous substances. These expenditures are expected to be sufficient to comply with existing environmental laws and regulations and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive position.
In the future, we may incur increased costs and additional charges associated with environmental compliance and cleanup projects necessitated by the identification of new waste sites, the impact of new environmental laws and regulatory standards, or the availability of new technologies. Compliance with Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations in the future may require a material increase in our capital expenditures and could adversely affect our earnings and competitive position.
INFORMATION ABOUT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
We engage in manufacturing and/or sales operations in most countries in the world, often through subsidiary companies. We have manufacturing operations in 21 countries, including the United States. Most of our international manufacturing operations are engaged in the production of tires. Certain other products are also manufactured in plants located outside the United States. Financial information related to our geographic areas for the three year period ended December 31, 2016 appears in the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 8, Business Segments, and is incorporated herein by reference.
In addition to the ordinary risks of the marketplace, in some countries our operations are affected by price or profit margin controls, import controls, labor regulations, tariffs, extreme inflation and/or fluctuations in currency values. Furthermore, in certain countries where we operate, transfers of funds into or out of such countries are generally or periodically subject to certain requirements. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks related to our international operations.
