Item 1. Business
Description of Business
 TPI Composites, Inc. is the holding company that conducts substantially all of its business operations through its direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the Company or we). The Company was founded in 1968 and has been producing composite wind blades since 2001. The Company’s knowledge and experience of composite materials and manufacturing originates with its predecessor company, Tillotson Pearson Inc., a leading manufacturer of high-performance sail and powerboats along with a wide range of composite structures used in other industrial applications. Following the separation from the boat building business in 2004, the Company reorganized in Delaware as LCSI Holding, Inc. and then changed its corporate name to TPI Composites, Inc. in 2008.
Overview
 We are the largest U.S.-based independent manufacturer of composite wind blades. We enable many of the industry’s leading wind turbine original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), who have historically relied on in-house production, to outsource the manufacturing of some of their wind blades through our global footprint of advanced manufacturing facilities strategically located to serve large and growing wind markets in a cost-effective manner. Given the importance of wind energy capture, turbine reliability and cost to power producers, the size, quality and performance of wind blades have become highly strategic to our OEM customers. As a result, we have become a key supplier to our OEM customers in the manufacture of wind blades and related precision molding and assembly systems. We have entered into long-term supply agreements pursuant to which we dedicate capacity at our facilities to our customers in exchange for their commitment to purchase minimum annual volumes of wind blade sets, which consist of three wind blades. As of February 28, 2017, our long-term supply agreements provide for estimated minimum aggregate volume commitments from our customers of $2.6 billion and encourage our customers to purchase additional volume up to, in the aggregate, an estimated total contract value of up to $3.9 billion through the end of 2023. This collaborative dedicated supplier model provides us with contracted volumes that generate significant revenue visibility, drive capital efficiency and allow us to produce wind blades at a lower total delivered cost, while ensuring critical dedicated capacity for our customers.
 Our wind blade and precision molding and assembly systems manufacturing businesses accounted for over 99% of our total net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. We also leverage our advanced composite technology and history of innovation to supply high strength, lightweight and durable composite products to the transportation market. For a further discussion regarding our wind blade and precision molding and assembly system businesses, refer to the discussion in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations” included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Initial Public Offering and Stock Split
 In July 2016, we completed an initial public offering (IPO) of 7,187,500 shares of our common stock at a price of $11.00 per share, which included 937,500 shares issued pursuant to the underwriters’ over-allotment option. Certain of our existing shareholders, a non-employee director and executive officers purchased an aggregate of 1,250,000 shares of common stock in the IPO included in the total issuance above. The net proceeds from the IPO were $67.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses. Immediately prior to the closing of the IPO, all shares of the then-outstanding redeemable preferred shares converted into an aggregate of 21,110,204 shares of common stock and the redeemable preferred share warrants converted on a net issuance basis into 120,923 shares of common stock. In addition, concurrent with the closing of the IPO, certain subordinated convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal and interest amount of $11.9 million were converted into 1,079,749 shares of common stock at the public offering price of $11.00 per share.
 Prior to the IPO, in July 2016 we amended our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to effect a 360-for-1 forward stock split of our common stock. As a result of the stock split, we have adjusted the share amounts authorized and issuable under our share-based compensation plans. All share and per share common stock information (including those related to our share-based compensation plans) referenced throughout the consolidated 
 2

financial statements and notes thereto have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this stock split. The stock split did not cause an adjustment to the par value of the authorized shares of common stock.

 Business Strategy
 Our long-term success will be driven by our business strategy. The key elements of our strategy are as follows:
  
• | Grow our existing relationships and develop new relationships with leading industry OEMs. We plan to continue growing and expanding our relationships with existing customers who, according to data from MAKE Consulting (MAKE), represented approximately 32% of the global onshore wind energy market, approximately 56% of that market excluding China, and over 82% of the U.S. onshore wind turbine market over the three years ended December 31, 2015, based on megawatts (MWs) of energy capacity installed, as well as developing new relationships with other leading industry OEMs. We are presented with opportunities to expand our existing relationships and develop new relationships with industry OEMs as they seek to capitalize on the benefits of outsourced wind blade manufacturing while maintaining high quality customization and dedicated capacity. In 2016, we extended the term of our existing Iowa and Mexico supply agreements with General Electric International, Inc. and its affiliates (GE Wind), and entered into a new supply agreement with GE Wind to supply them with wind blades from our third manufacturing facility in Mexico, which became operational in January 2017. We also entered into a new supply agreement with Gamesa Wind US LLC (Gamesa) whereby we will continue to supply wind blades to them from our existing manufacturing facility in Mexico as well as from our second Mexico manufacturing facility. We also extended the term of our existing Turkey supply agreement with Nordex SE (Nordex) and entered into a new supply agreement with Nordex to supply them with wind blades from our second manufacturing facility in Turkey. In January 2017, we extended the term of our existing China supply agreement with Vestas Wind Systems A/S (Vestas) and also amended our existing Turkey supply agreement with Vestas.

As the wind energy market continues to expand globally and many wind turbine OEMs continue to shift towards increased outsourcing of wind blade manufacturing, we believe we are well-positioned to continue the expansion of our global footprint. We utilize our strengths in composites technology and manufacturing, combined with our collaborative dedicated supplier model to provide our customers with an efficient solution for their expansion in large and growing wind markets. Our quality, reliability and total delivered cost reduce sourcing risk for our customers. In addition, our demonstrated ability to expand into new markets and the strength of our manufacturing capabilities afford us the optionality either to build new factories or grow through strategic acquisitions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Focus on continuing innovation. We have a history of innovation in advanced composite technologies and production techniques and use several proprietary technologies related to wind blade manufacturing. With this culture of innovation and a collaborative “design for manufacturability” approach, we continue to address increasing physical dimensions, demanding technical specifications and strict quality control requirements for our customers’ most advanced wind blades. We also invest in ongoing simplification and selective automation of production processes for increased efficiency and precision. In addition, we plan to leverage our history of composite industry-first innovations to grow our business in the transportation market, in which we believe there is a demand for high precision, structural composites manufacturing.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to drive down costs of wind energy. We continue to work with our customers on larger size wind blade models that maximize the capture of wind energy and drive down the levelized cost of energy (LCOE). We also continue to utilize our advanced technology, regional manufacturing facilities strategically located to cost effectively serve large and growing wind markets and ability to source materials globally at competitive costs to deliver high-performing, composite wind blades at a lower total delivered cost. Our collaborative engineering approach and our advanced precision molding and assembly systems allow us to integrate our customer’s design requirements with cost-efficient, replicable and scalable manufacturing processes. We also continue to collaborate with our customers to drive down the cost of materials and production, the benefit of which we typically share with our customers contractually in a manner that reduces LCOE for customers, further strengthens our customer relationships and improves our margins.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wind Blade Manufacturing Operations and Process
 We have developed significant expertise in advanced composite technology and use high performance composite materials, precision molding and assembly systems including modular tooling, and advanced process technology, as well as sophisticated measurement, inspection, testing and quality assurance tools, allowing us to produce over 30,000 wind blades since 2001 with an excellent field performance record in a market where reliability is critical to our customers’ success. We manufacture or have manufactured wind blades ranging from 30 meters to over 60 meters across our global facilities, and have the capability to manufacture wind blades of greater lengths at all of our advanced manufacturing facilities as required by existing or new customers. In combination with our advanced technologies, we seek to create manufacturing processes that are replicable and scalable in our manufacturing facilities located worldwide, regardless of cultural or language barriers. Our integrated manufacturing process allows us to customize each manufacturing step, from raw materials to finished products. It also allows us to systematically design for the entire manufacturing process so that we can achieve better quality control and increase production efficiencies. We believe that our focus on simplifying and, where feasible, automating production processes is critical to manufacturing high-precision, lightweight and durable products at a reasonable cost to our customers. We produce high unit volumes of near-aerospace grade products at industrial costs.
Raw Materials
 The key raw materials for our wind blades include highly advanced fiberglass fabrics, select carbon reinforcements, foam, balsa wood, resin, adhesives for assembly of molded components, gel coat or paint for preparation of cosmetic surfaces and attachment hardware including steel components. Most of these materials are available in multiple geographic regions and in reasonably close proximity to our manufacturing facilities. Our 
 4

agreements for the supply of raw materials are designed to guarantee volumes that we believe will be required to fulfill our customers’ wind blade commitments. A portion of our raw materials are subject to price volatility, such as the resins used in our manufacturing processes. Although the majority of materials incorporated into our products are available from a number of sources, certain materials are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers. We seek multiple suppliers for our raw materials and continually evaluate potential new supplier relationships.
 Precision Molding and Assembly Systems
 Over the last decade, we have produced hundreds of precision molding and assembly systems, ranging from 30 meters to over 60 meters in length, to support our global operations. We began these operations in our tooling technology center in Warren, Rhode Island. In 2013, we expanded our precision molding and assembly system production capabilities to a facility in Taicang City, China, which serves customers around the globe. While capable of cost-effectively delivering precision molding and assembly systems across all of our facilities, our Rhode Island tooling technology center primarily serves the North American market. Our precision molding and assembly systems have been used to build tens of thousands of wind blades worldwide.
 Our tooling solutions include precision wind blade patterns, precision molding and assembly systems, including modular tooling techniques. We believe that our technological and production expertise are key factors in our continued competitiveness, as we address continually increasing physical dimensions, demanding technical specifications, and strict quality control requirements for wind blades.
 Wind Blade Production Process
 Production of our wind blades requires adherence to the unique specifications of our customers, who design their wind turbines and wind blades to optimize performance, reliability and total delivered cost. With our culture of innovation and a collaborative “design for manufacturability” approach, we have the capability and expertise to manufacture wind blades of different designs, utilizing fiberglass, carbon or other advanced composite materials to meet unique customer specifications. We also have the flexibility to quickly transition our manufacturing capabilities to produce different wind blade models and sizes using our precision molding and assembly systems, including modular tooling techniques.
 We have developed a highly dependable method for making high-quality wind blades. We design our proprietary manufacturing processes to be replicable, scalable and transferable to each of our advanced manufacturing facilities worldwide. As a result, we can repeatedly move a product from its design phase to volume production while maintaining quality, even in developing regions of the world. Similarly, we have developed the manual portions of our manufacturing processes based on proven technologies and production methods that can be learned and implemented rapidly by line personnel. We focus on consistency and quality control across our facilities, using hands-on training methods and employing repeatable manufacturing processes.
 We use an advanced form of vacuum-assisted resin transfer tooling process to pull liquid resin into a dry lay-up, resulting in light, strong, and reliable composite structures. In our manufacturing process, fiber reinforcements and core materials are laid up in a tool while dry, followed by a vacuum bag that is placed over the layup and sealed to the mold. The wind blade component is then placed under vacuum. The resin is introduced into the wind blade component via resin inlet ports and then distributed through the reinforcement and core materials via a flow medium and a series of channels, saturating the wind blade component. The vacuum removes air and gases during processing, thereby eliminating voids. Pressure differentials drive resin uniformly throughout the wind blade component, providing a consistent laminate. By using a variety of reinforcement and core materials, the structural characteristics of the wind blade can be highly engineered to suit the custom specifications of our customers. Although only occasionally required by our customers, we are also capable of employing additional composite fabrication processes, such as pre-impregnated laminates, in addition to our vacuum infusion process.

Wind Blade Long-Term Supply Agreements
 Our current wind blade customers, which include GE Wind, Vestas, Gamesa and Nordex (which acquired Acciona Windpower, S.A. (Acciona) in April 2016), are some of the world’s largest wind turbine manufacturers. According to data from MAKE, our customers represented approximately 32% of the global onshore wind energy market, approximately 56% of that market excluding China, and over 82% of the U.S. onshore wind turbine market over the three years ended December 31, 2015, based on MWs of energy capacity installed. In our collaborative dedicated supplier model, our customers are incentivized to maximize the volume of wind blades purchased through lower pricing at higher purchase volumes. As of February 28, 2017, our existing wind blade supply agreements provide for estimated minimum aggregate volume commitments of $2.6 billion and encourages customers to, in the aggregate, purchase additional volume up to an estimated total contract value of up to $3.9 billion through the end of 2023, which we believe provides us with significant future revenue visibility and helps to insulate us from potential short-term fluctuations or legislative changes in any one market. Although in some instances our supply agreements contain liquidated damages provisions in the event of late delivery, we generally do not bear the responsibility for transportation and delivery costs in connection with the delivery of our wind blades.
 GE Wind
 In 2007, we entered into a supply agreement to build a facility and manufacture wind blades for GE Wind in Taicang Port, China. Later in 2007, we entered into a similar agreement to build a facility and manufacture wind blades for GE Wind in Newton, Iowa. Based on the success of these manufacturing arrangements, we were able to expand our customer relationship with GE Wind through additional supply agreements for our manufacturing facility in Turkey and two of our manufacturing facilities in Mexico in 2011, 2013 and 2016, respectively. Subject to certain exceptions on a plant-by-plant basis, each of our supply agreements with GE Wind provide for a minimum number of wind blade sets to be purchased by GE Wind each year during the term, the schedule for which is established at the outset of the agreement. In return, we commit to dedicate a specific number of manufacturing lines to GE Wind for each of the years 2017 through 2020. Additionally, we create model-specific tooling for GE Wind. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded related-party sales under these supply agreements with GE Wind of $379.9 million, $312.5 million and $234.8 million, respectively. In March 2017, the Company and GE Wind announced that the parties do not intend to renew the Turkey supply agreement, which expires on December 31, 2017. Unless otherwise terminated or renewed, our supply agreements with GE Wind are in effect until the end of 2017 for our China facility and the end of 2020 for our Iowa and two Mexico facilities. In some cases, GE Wind may terminate its supply agreements early upon providing us with 123 to 360 days’ advance written notice and in one instance, no advance notice, and paying us termination fees as set forth in the applicable agreement. In addition, either party may terminate these supply agreements upon a material breach by the other party which goes uncured for 30 days after written notice has been provided. 
 In October 2016, General Electric Company (GE) announced its planned acquisition of LM Wind Power (LM), our largest competitor, and GE anticipates closing this acquisition in the first half of 2017. Although we recently extended and expanded certain of our supply agreements with GE Wind, GE Wind could elect to utilize LM for more of its wind blade production, reduce the volumes of wind blades it purchases from us or terminate any of our supply agreements, which may materially harm our relationship, business, financial condition and results of operations. In March 2017, the Company and GE Wind announced that the parties do not intend to renew the Turkey supply agreement. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Wind Blade Business—GE’s planned acquisition of LM Wind Power, our largest competitor, may materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and may cause the price of our common stock to decline” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discuss on the GE’s planned acquisition and its potential effects on us.  
 See Note 3 – Related Party Transactions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our related party transactions with GE Wind.
 Other Long-Term Supply Agreements
 We have entered into other long-term supply agreements in China, Mexico and Turkey. Under all but one of these agreements, we agree to dedicate capacity for a set number of wind blades for each calendar year during the 
 6

term of the agreement in exchange for commitments to purchase minimum annual volumes of wind blade sets. Unless otherwise terminated, these supply agreements generally remain in effect for a period of five years and either party may terminate their respective supply agreements upon a material breach by the other party which goes uncured. Some of these supply agreements contain provisions that allow for termination by the customer upon notice for reasons such as our failure to deliver the contracted wind blade volumes or our failure to meet certain mutually agreed upon cost reduction targets. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Wind Blade Business—Our long-term supply agreements with our customers are subject to termination on short notice and our failure to perform our obligations under such agreements, and termination of a significant number of these agreements would materially harm our business” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Research and Development
 We have a long history of developing composite products as well as the development of new and advanced materials, tooling, manufacturing processes and inspection methods. Our knowledge and experience of composite materials and manufacturing originates with our predecessor company, Tillotson Pearson Inc., a leading manufacturer of high-performance recreational sail and powerboats along with a wide range of composite structures used in other industrial applications. Leveraging our knowledge and experience, we realized the opportunity to specialize in other industrial end-markets where there was a demand for high precision composite manufacturing capabilities.
 We conduct extensive research and development in close collaboration with our customers on the design, development and deployment of innovative manufacturing processes, including automation, advanced materials and sophisticated product quality inspection tools. We partnered with the U.S. Department of Energy, government laboratories, universities and our customers to innovate through cost sharing Advanced Manufacturing Innovation Initiative programs. In 2015, we received an award of $3.0 million from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy to lead a team of industry and academic participants to design, develop and demonstrate an ultra-light composite vehicle door for high volume manufacturing production in conjunction with other industry and university participants. We employ a highly experienced workforce of engineers in various facets of our business, from discrete research and development projects, to the ongoing, real-time development and implementation of incremental manufacturing and material improvements. Our research and development effort places a priority on improving quality through process and procedure improvement, in addition to reducing cost through specification changes and sourcing of more cost-effective suppliers. Other areas of emphasis include composite design, in-house fabrication of precision molding and assembly systems, prototyping, testing, optimization and volume production capabilities. We also encourage our employees to invent and develop new technologies to maintain our competitiveness in the marketplace. In addition to our internal research and development activities, from time to time, we also conduct research and development activities pursuant to funded development arrangements with our customers and other third parties, and intend to continue to seek opportunities for product development programs that could create recurring revenue and increase our overall profitability over the long term.
 For financial statement purposes, research and development is reflected in general and administrative expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our research and development expenses were $1.5 million, $0.9 million and $0.8 million, respectively.
 Competition
 The wind blade market is highly concentrated, competitive and subject to evolving customer needs and expectations. In October 2016, GE, our largest customer, announced its planned acquisition of LM, our largest competitor, and GE anticipates closing this acquisition in the first half of 2017. We also compete primarily with other independent wind blade manufacturers, such as Tecsis GmbH, Sinoma Science & Technology Co. Ltd. and ZhongFu Lianzhong Composites Group Co., Ltd., as well as regional wind blade suppliers in geographic areas where our current or prospective manufacturing facilities are located. 
 We also compete with, and in a number of cases supplement, vertically integrated wind turbine OEMs that manufacture their wind blades. We believe that a number of other established companies are manufacturing wind blades that will compete directly with our offerings, and some of our competitors, including LM, Tecsis GmbH, 
 7

Sinoma Science & Technology Co. Ltd. and ZhongFu Lianzhong Composites Group Co., Ltd. may have significant financial and institutional resources.
 The principal competitive factors in the wind blade market include reliability, total delivered cost, manufacturing capability, product quality, engineering capability and timely completion of wind blades. We believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of the foregoing factors. Our ability to remain competitive will depend to a great extent upon our ongoing performance in the areas of manufacturing capability, timely completion and product quality.
 Transportation Products
 We seek to create additional recurring revenue opportunities through the supply of other composite structures outside the wind energy market. We believe larger scale and higher volume transportation products, including buses, trucks, electric vehicles and high performance automotive products, are ideally suited for our advanced composite technology because of the benefits derived from weight reduction, corrosion resistance, strength and durability. These benefits should allow us to develop structural composite solutions to assist our customers in developing buses with clean propulsion systems or in meeting new and developing fuel economy standards including the 2025 U.S. Government Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards that are pushing automakers to develop lighter, more fuel efficient vehicles with lower emissions. In 2015, we received a $3.0 million award from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy to design, develop and demonstrate an ultra-light composite vehicle door for high volume manufacturing production in conjunction with various other industry and university participants.
 In addition, by producing a range of composite structures, we are able to leverage the materials and manufacturing process technology and expertise developed through one project to maximize production quality, improve performance and minimize costs across our other manufacturing efforts, including our wind blade business. Our projects for customers in the transportation market have historically generated project-related revenues for a specific duration. We intend to seek collaborations with additional customers in these markets that will provide recurring project revenue and business opportunities for us, in addition to the opportunities provided by our existing customers and relationships, and increase our overall profitability over the long term. In 2017, we entered into a supply agreement with Proterra Inc. to supply bus bodies from our New England manufacturing facilities. 
 Our facility in Warren, Rhode Island manufactures products for customers in the transportation market using the same proprietary and replicable manufacturing processes that we use to produce our wind blades. Our projects for customers in the transportation market include or have included the supply of all-composite bodies for electric buses and automated people mover systems for airports. 
 Our current principal competitors in the transportation market include suppliers of conventional steel and aluminum products and non-structural automotive fiberglass and other advanced composites-based manufacturers for transportation applications.
 Intellectual Property
 We have a variety of intellectual property rights, including patents (filed and applied-for in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States, the European Union and China), trademarks and copyrights, but we believe that our continued success and competitive position depend, in large part, on our proprietary materials, tooling, process and inspection technologies and our ability to innovate. Accordingly, we take measures to protect the confidentiality and control the disclosure of our proprietary technology. We rely primarily on a combination of know-how and trade secrets to establish and protect our proprietary rights and preserve our competitive position. We also seek to protect our proprietary technology, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our customers, employees, consultants and other contractors. Trade secrets, however, are difficult to protect. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our customers, employees, consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.

Backlog
 As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the backlog for our wind blades and related products totaled $567.3 million and $519.0 million, respectively. Our backlog includes purchase orders signed in connection with our long-term supply agreements. We generally record a purchase order into backlog when the following requirements have been met: a signed long-term supply agreement has been executed with our customer, a purchase order has been made by our customer and we expect to ship wind blades to such customer in satisfaction of any purchase order within 12 months. Backlog as of any particular date should not be relied upon as indicative of our revenue for any future period. Although in certain circumstances projects may be delayed, in these circumstances the long-term supply agreement generally rolls forward and the revenue remains on the backlog until the project commences.
Regulation
 Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local regulations related to environmental protection, health and safety, labor relationships, general business practices and other matters. These regulations are administered by various foreign, federal, state and local environmental agencies and authorities, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor and comparable agencies in China, Mexico and Turkey. In addition, our manufacturing operations in China, Mexico and Turkey are subject to those countries’ wage and price controls, currency exchange control regulations, investment and tax laws, laws restricting our ability to repatriate profits, trade restrictions and laws that may restrict foreign investment in certain industries. Some of these laws have only been recently adopted or are subject to further rulemaking or interpretation, and their impact on our operations, including the cost of complying with these laws, is uncertain. We maintain a policy of adhering to the laws of the United States or the country in which our manufacturing facility is located, whichever is stricter, and believe that our operations currently comply, in all material respects, with applicable laws and regulations. Further, as a U.S. corporation, we and our subsidiaries are subject to The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA), which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business.
 In addition, our business has been and will continue to be affected by subsidization of the wind turbine industry with its influence declining over time as wind energy reaches grid parity with traditional sources of energy. In the United States, the federal government has encouraged capital investment in renewable energy primarily through tax incentives. Production tax credits for new renewable energy projects were first established in 1992. The Production Tax Credit for Renewable Energy (PTC) provided the owner of a wind turbine placed in operation before January 1, 2015 with a 10-year credit against its U.S. federal income tax obligations based on the amount of electricity generated by the wind turbine.
 The PTC was extended in December 2015 for wind power projects through December 31, 2019, and is currently contemplated to be phased down over the term of the PTC extension. Specifically, the PTC will be kept at the same rate in effect at the end of 2014 for wind power projects that either commenced construction or met certain safe harbor requirements by the end of 2016, and thereafter will be reduced by 20% per year in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.
 In August 2015, the EPA announced a final rule adopted pursuant to the Clean Air Act, known as the Clean Power Plan, which establishes national standards for states to reduce carbon emissions from power plants. Specifically, the Clean Power Plan requires states to reduce carbon emissions from power plants 32% below 2005 levels by 2030. The Clean Power Plan also provides for interim state-level compliance reduction targets beginning in 2022 through 2030 based on individualized targets for each of the states utilizing 2012 historical carbon emissions data and three building blocks for emissions reduction including: increasing generation from new zero-emitting renewable energy sources such as wind. In February 2016, the United States Supreme Court issued a stay of the EPA’s implementation of the Clean Power Plan until the D.C. Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals decides upon the merits of multiple lawsuits challenging the legality of the Clean Power Plan. In addition, President Trump has made comments during his presidency and the presidential campaign suggesting that he is not supportive of various clean energy programs and initiatives designed to curtail global warming and may attempt to eliminate, modify or further reduce the scope of the Clean Power Plan.

At the state level, as of December 31, 2016, 29 states and the District of Columbia have implemented renewable portfolio standard (RPS) programs that generally require that, by a specified date, a certain percentage of a utility’s electricity supplied to consumers within such state is to be from renewable sources (generally between 15% and 50% by 2020 or 2030).
 In addition, there are also increasing regulatory efforts to promote renewable power. China is currently implementing its 13th 5-Year Plan with a goal of 15% total primary energy from non-fossil fuel sources and targeting 210 gigawatts (GWs) of grid-connected wind capacity by 2020 according to its National Development and Reform Commission, and employs preferential feed-in tariff schemes, in addition to local tax-based incentives. Mexico has established strict targets, aiming for 35% renewable energy by 2024 and 50% by 2050, according to MAKE, which it is facilitating through tax incentives. Large European Union members have renewable energy targets for 2020 of between 13% and 49% of all energy use derived from renewable energy sources, according to MAKE. Additionally, Turkey enacted Law No. 5346 in 2005 to promote renewable-based electricity generation within their domestic electricity market by introducing tariffs and purchase obligations for distribution companies requiring purchases from certified renewable energy producers. The World Bank also provided Turkey with an aggregate of $600 million of loan proceeds to encourage investors to construct generation plants with renewable energy resources.
