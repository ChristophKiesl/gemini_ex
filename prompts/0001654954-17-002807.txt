  Business Overview
  
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 62 full-time employees and information technology independent contractors. We possess certifications with our business and technology partners and our personnel maintain numerous certifications and qualifications. Our professionals are located at our headquarters in Pittsford, New York and in Colorado, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia.
  
 We had sales of approximately $7.4 million in 2016 and approximately $7.9 million in 2015. We generated an operating loss of approximately $75,000 in 2016 as compared to an operating loss of approximately $455,000 in 2015. We derived approximately 68% of our sales in 2016 and 84% in 2015 from federal, state and local government contracts as either a prime contractor or a subcontractor.
  
  During 2016, we focused on increasing sales of VMware virtualization software licenses in the SLED and commercial sectors. We have become less reliant on sales of U.S. Federal Government virtualization projects as an OEM subcontractor and increased our direct sales of virtualization projects to both SLED and commercial businesses.
  
  During 2016, we were added to the umbrella NYS OGS Contract through our partnership with VMware. Accordingly. our personnel worked with SLED and other NYS personnel to build relationships needed to pursue additional sales of VMware software licenses and services through the bidding process. During 2016, under this agreement we sold and delivered virtualization software licenses to New York State.
   
  We achieved an 80% increase in sales of Webroot to commercial customers through our channel partners in 2016 and began to earn operating income after incurring start-up losses in prior periods.
  
 During 2016, we derived approximately 60% of our sales from one client, HPE, including sales under subcontracts for services to several of its end clients principally a major establishment of the U.S. Government (the U.S. Government Entity) for which we manage one of the nation’s largest Microsoft Windows environments. We have been providing this service to the U.S. Government Entity under a long-standing subcontract, which has been renewed annually since 2004. Our team of server experts supports approximately 3,000 servers and 250,000 client stations from facilities in Maryland and Colorado. Operating 24 hours per day and seven days per week, we consistently meet or exceed the requirements of our service level agreements. We refer to this as our Advanced Server Management (ASM) team.
  
 We provide support to professional service organizations of software companies and commercial entities that need additional skilled resources when implementing solutions. We provide cloud computing solutions that include public and private cloud architectures along with hybrid scalable cloud hosting, server virtualization and desktop virtualization solutions. Our experience with cloud and virtualization computing related software has enabled us to take advantage of a growing trend towards Managed IT Services, particularly in security and the SME space. Sales to our principal client, VMware, Inc., consisted of sales under subcontracts for services to their end clients. During 2016, we provided professional services to these clients and earned approximately 22% of our sales.
  
  Business Strategy
  
 Our strategy is to build our business by designing, developing, and marketing IT security based products and solutions that fill technology gaps in cybersecurity. We brought one product to market and we intend to bring other proprietary products and solutions to market through a channel of domestic and international partners and distributors. Our products and solutions are designed to simplify the security needs in customer and partner environments, with a focus on SMEs. We enable our partners by providing recurring revenue based business models that use our automated plug and play solutions. Products may be sold as standalone solutions or integrated into existing environments to further automate the management of security and related IT functions. Our ability to succeed depends on how successful we are in differentiating ourselves in the market at a time when competition in these markets is on the rise. We work with our partner, Webroot, to increase our base of channel partners and to increase sales of Webroot’s cloud based endpoint security solution, with the objective of growing our recurring revenue model.
  
 Our cybersecurity services business is conducted within our PSO. We provide services and technical resources to support both our channel partners and end customers. Our goal is to expand our VMware business in both the public and commercial sector by building VMware license sales volume and services concurrently.
  
 We are working to expand our managed services business with our current federal enterprise customer and with other customers of HPE.
  
 We review potential acquisitions of IT assets and businesses as part of our growth strategy.

  Product
 
 We launched Nodeware in November 2016. Nodeware is an automated, continuous plug and play network vulnerability management system that consists of hardware and software. This product is intended to fill a need in the SME market. It assesses vulnerabilities in a computer network using scanning technology to capture a comprehensive view of the security exposure of a network and infrastructure. Users receive alerts and view network information and reports through a proprietary dashboard. This cloud based service is provided with our monthly maintenance and support subscription. Continuous and automated internal scanning and external on demand scanning are available within this offering.
  
  Nodeware is used to eliminate security gaps for SMEs. It creates an opportunity for resellers, including managed service providers, managed security service providers, distributors, and value added resellers. We sell Nodeware in the commercial sector through our current channel partners. We present our Nodeware solution to our existing Webroot channel partners and potential new partners in North America and in certain foreign countries.
  
  Intellectual Property
  
  We believe that our intellectual property is an asset that may contribute to the growth and profitability of our business. We rely on a combination of patent and confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in the United States and abroad. To date, we have filed one provisional patent application for our proprietary product, Nodeware, in May 2016. The efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective.
  
  The U.S. patent system permits the filing of provisional and non-provisional patent applications. A non-provisional patent application is examined by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and can mature into a patent once the USPTO determines that the claimed invention meets the standards for patentability. A provisional patent application is not examined, and automatically expires 12 months after its filing date. As a result, a provisional patent application cannot mature into a patent. The requirements for filing a provisional patent application are not as strict as those for filing a non-provisional patent application. Provisional applications are often used, among other things, to establish an early filing date for a subsequent non-provisional patent application.
  
  The filing date of a non-provisional patent application is used by the USPTO to determine what information is prior art when it considers the patentability of a claimed invention. If certain requirements are satisfied, a non-provisional patent application can claim the benefit of the filing date of an earlier filed provisional patent application. As a result, the filing date accorded by the provisional patent application may remove information that otherwise could preclude the patentability of an invention.
  
  Technology and Product Development
  
 Our goal is to position our products and solutions to enable vertical integration with other solutions. We have a technology and product development strategy aligned with our business strategy.
 Cybersecurity Services
  
 We provide cybersecurity consulting services to channel partners and direct customers across different vertical markets (banking, healthcare, manufacturing, etc.) in North America.  Our cybersecurity projects use Nodeware to create a living document that a customer can use to go forward on a path of continuous improvement for its overall IT security. We validate overall network security with the goal of maintaining the integrity of confidential client information, preserving the continuity of services, and minimizing potential data damage from attempted threats and incidents.
 Government Contract Vehicles and Agreements
  
  A government contract vehicle is a mechanism for conducting business with government entities which helps to significantly reduce such entities’ lead time for procuring products or services and lowers agency acquisition costs associated with managing complex bid procedures. We believe that possessing contract vehicles will facilitate sales growth if we are successful at bidding and winning business within task orders generated under these vehicles. However, the amount of sales that we may generate is not determinable until a specific project award is made.
  
 Federal Supply Schedule Contract. In 2003, we were awarded a Federal Supply Schedule Contract by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) for IT consulting services (Schedule 70). Our Schedule 70 contract was extended through May 2019. Having a Schedule 70 allows us to compete for and secure prime contracts with all executive agencies of the U.S. Government, as well as other national and international organizations. Our Schedule 70 contract encompasses 95 different labor categories. We have used our Schedule 70 as a basis for pricing our current and proposed work.
  
 New York State and Local Government and Education (SLED). In 2016, we began working with VMware when it established a contract with NYS. VMware designated us as one of a select group of partners that is authorized to sell VMware licenses to SLED customers throughout New York State under their 2016 New York State Information Technology Service (ITS) Manufacturer Umbrella Contract.
  
 The Quilt. The Quilt is the non-profit national coalition of 36 of our country’s most advanced regional research and education organizations. Participants in The Quilt provide advanced network services and applications to over 250 universities and thousands of other educational institutions. Based on The Quilt participants’ combined experiences in operations and development of leading-edge technologies, The Quilt aims to influence the national agenda on information technology infrastructure, with emphasis on networking for research and education. Through this coalition, The Quilt promotes delivery of networking services at lower cost, higher performance and greater reliability and security. Carahsoft is a master government aggregator and distributor for the industry’s leading and emerging IT manufacturers. We have an agreement with Carahsoft to place orders against Carahsoft’s Quilt contract for VMware products and support services for a period of one year, renewable annually.

  Partner Agreements
  
 VMware Enterprise Solution Provider and Consulting Subcontractor. Since 2007, we have been approved as a VMware Authorized Consultant (VAC) by VMware, Inc. VMware is recognized as the industry leader in virtualization technology. As a VAC, we are trained and certified to deliver consulting services and solutions leveraging VMware technology. Our cloud solutions let entities convert the capital expenditure of building and maintaining in-house data storage and computing systems to an affordable, low monthly operating cost. We compare desired outcomes, determine financial implications and create a clear plan to optimize this technology. We implement offsite data storage, server virtualization, virtual desktop infrastructure, and public, private or hybrid cloud solutions.
  
 We recognized an increasing demand for VMware related services in the public sector (U.S. Government and state marketplace) and joined VMware’s Consulting and Integration Partner Program (CIPP), a program specifically targeted toward highly skilled and committed partners. We have completed over 700 projects around the globe and in market sectors including U.S. Government, state governments, education, and commercial corporations.
  
 During 2015, we became a VMware Enterprise Level Solution Provider (ESP) where we still have the benefits of an architect, integration, and service partner along with the ability to sell VMware licenses. We believe that this has positioned us to create our own opportunities to sell VMware licenses directly to end customers and still service the customer under our current relationship with the VMware Professional Services Organization. We are registered with the U.S. Federal and Education Specializations and SLED within VMware. 
  
  Certifications
  
 Our technical support personnel maintain leading edge certifications and qualifications in the respective software applications. These certifications are examples of our concerted effort to grow and expand our virtualization practice. We believe that our virtualization experience and expertise with VMware will offer opportunities to increase sales, particularly in the cloud computing market.
  
 CISSP® - Certified Information Systems Security Professionals. The CISSP certification is a credential for those with technical and managerial competence, skills, experience, and credibility to design, engineer, implement, and manage overall information security programs to protect organizations from increasingly sophisticated attacks.  It is a globally recognized standard of achievement. Certain of our employees in our cybersecurity group have this certification.
  
 Microsoft Silver Certified Partner.   We are part of Microsoft's Accredited Online Cloud Services program. We have been certified in sales, pricing and technical delivery of Office 365 which combines the familiar Office desktop suite with cloud-based versions of the next-generation communications and collaboration services: Exchange Online, SharePoint Online and Lync Online. These services are providing real world benefits to our clients while allowing us to offer clear guidelines for transitioning new users to hybrid-cloud-based solutions. We received certification for Windows Intune which provides complete remote desktop support capabilities enhancing our overall goal of providing complete solutions for virtualization and cloud based Software as a Service (SaaS). What once required expensive hardware and time consuming deployments can now be delivered seamlessly, including web conferencing, collaboration, document management, messaging, customer relationship management and productive office web applications all with lower total cost of ownership and quicker return on investment. We believe our Microsoft competencies assist our business development personnel when presenting solutions that, if accepted, will increase our sales.
  
 Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE) Global Procurement Master Terms Agreement. We are a member of a select group of suppliers that enables HPE to purchase products and services from us under a global procurement master agreement and as specified in a statement of work.  HPE has many tools and resources to help us generate new sales streams, and improve our mutual profitability, while at the same time adding unique value for our joint clients.  The program comprises practical tools and services that we anticipate will help us in the key areas of marketing and selling our solutions, optimizing the technology, and collaborating with other organizations within our industry to generate more revenue.  Our global procurement master agreement with HPE runs to January 2019.
  
  Competition
  
 We compete with other IT professional services firms operating in the U.S. Government, state and local government and commercial marketplace. We obtain a portion of our business based on proposals submitted in response to requests from potential and current clients, who typically also receive proposals from other firms. We face competition in the commercial markets from other IT service providers and software development companies, large and small. Many of our competitors, in general, have substantially greater capital resources, research and development staffs, sales, and marketing resources, facilities, and experience than we do.

  Employees
  
  As of December 31, 2016, we have 62 full-time employees, including 46 in information technology services, three in executive management, four in accounting, finance and administration, and nine in software development, marketing and sales. We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements and we believe that relations with our employees and independent contractors are good. We believe that we are currently staffed at an appropriate level to administratively implement and carry out our business plan for the next 12 months. However, we expect to add positions in marketing and information technology services as we expand our sales.
  
 Our ability to develop and market our services, and to establish and maintain a competitive position in our businesses will depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain qualified technical, marketing and managerial personnel, of which there can be no assurance.
