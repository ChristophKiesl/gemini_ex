Overview
 
Tecnoglass is a leading vertically-integrated manufacturer, supplier and installer of architectural glass, windows, and associated aluminum products for the global commercial and residential construction industries. Tecnoglass was rated the second largest glass fabricator as well as the second largest metal company serving the United States in 2020 by Glass Magazine. Headquartered in Barranquilla, Colombia, the Company operates out of a 2.7 million square foot vertically-integrated, state-of-the-art manufacturing complex that provides easy access to the Americas, the Caribbean, and the Pacific. Tecnoglass supplies over 1,000 customers in North, Central and South America, with the United States accounting for 91% of revenues. Tecnoglass’ tailored, high-end products are found on some of the world’s most distinctive properties, including the El Dorado Airport (Bogota), 50 United Nations Plaza (New York), Trump Plaza (Panama), Icon Bay (Miami), and Salesforce Tower (San Francisco).
 
On May 3, 2019, we consummated a joint venture agreement with Compagnie de Saint-Gobain S.A. (“Saint-Gobain”), a world leader in the production of float glass, a key component of our manufacturing process, whereby we acquired a 25.8% minority ownership interest in Vidrio Andino Holdings S.A.S (“Vidirio Andino”), a Colombia-based subsidiary of Saint-Gobain. The purchase price for our interest in Vidrio Andino was $45 million, of which $34.1 million was paid in cash and $10.9 million was paid through the contribution of land on December 9, 2020. On October 28, 2020 we acquired said land from a related party and paid for it with the issuance of an aggregate of 1,557,142 ordinary shares of the Company, valued at $7.00 per share, which represented an approximate 33% premium based on the closing stock price as of October 27, 2020.
 
The joint venture agreement includes plans to build a new plant in Galapa, Colombia that will be located approximately 20 miles from our primary manufacturing facility, in which we will also have a 25.8% interest. The new plant will be funded with proceeds from the original cash contribution made by the Company, operating cashflows from the Bogota plant, debt incurred at the joint venture level that will not consolidate into the Company and an additional contribution by us of approximately $12.5 million if needed (based on debt availability).

On March 24, 2020, Colombia went into a mandatory lockdown as a result of the novel coronavirus outbreak. As a result, the Company temporarily suspended production at its facilities in Colombia through April 13, 2020 during the initial phase of the nationwide shelter-in-place order. While the shelter-in-place order was subsequently extended to May 25, 2020, the Company resumed full operations at its facilities on April 14, 2020 given its exempted designation as a supplier of critical products to essential business sectors such as infrastructure and construction. At the same time, most of our customers in the United States and Colombia were resuming their activities. During the period that production was suspended, vacation days were used to retain eligible employees and the Company used the time to implement broad safety measures before returning to normal operations. The Company entered the pandemic with a strong financial position along with the flexibility required to support its global operations during this volatile period. We have implemented strict cost controls, reduced operating expenses and limited all non-critical capital expenditures beyond the completion of initiatives started in 2019. During fiscal year 2020, working capital was a net benefit to cash flow.
 
On October 30, 2020, we entered into a new $300 million Senior Secured Credit Facility, consisting of a $250 million delayed draw term loan and a $50 million committed revolving credit facility, with a maturity date of October 31, 2025. BBVA USA is the joint lead arranger, sole bookrunner, administrative agent and a lender under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, and Banco de Sabadell, S.A., Miami Branch, Citizens Bank, N.A., and ING Bank N.V. – Dublin Branch are joint lead arrangers and lenders. The term loans may be Eurodollar loans or base rate loans and are repayable in consecutive quarterly installments of 1.25% of the outstanding term loans through September 30, 2023 and 1.875% of the outstanding term loans thereafter through maturity. The revolving loans may be Eurodollar loans or base rate loans. Eurodollar loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) an amount based on the LIBOR rate, with a floor of 0.75%, plus (ii) an initial margin rate of 3.0%, with subsequent margin rates between 2.5% and 3.5%, depending on the ratio of the Company’s consolidated total debt less up to $10 million of qualifying cash to the Company’s consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the four quarters ending on or prior to such date (“Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio”). Base rate loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (x) the higher of the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, the Administrative Agent’s prime rate, and the Eurodollar rate for a one month interest period plus 1%, plus (y) an initial margin rate of 2.0%, with subsequent margin rates between 1.5% and 2.5%, depending on the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio.
 
The term loans and revolving loans are secured by substantially all of the Company’s tangible and intangible property, including contracts and contract rights, accounts receivable, and intellectual property, and the pledge of the issued and outstanding shares of stock or other equity interests of certain of the Company’s direct and indirect subsidiaries, pursuant to a Security Agreement, between the Company and BBVA USA.
 
The Senior Secured Credit Facility has an accordion feature allowing the Company to increase the borrowing capacity to $325 million. In December 2020, we used $23.1 million proceeds of this facility to repay all outstanding borrowings under our previous credit facilities except the Company’s existing $210 million unsecured senior notes, which bear interest at a rate of 8.2% and mature in 2022, which we subsequently redeemed in full at the end of January 2021 following a step down in redemption price, with $220 million additional proceeds from this credit facility.

Our Business
 
General
 
We are a vertically-integrated manufacturer, supplier and installer of architectural glass, windows and associated aluminum products for the global commercial and residential construction markets. With a focus on innovation, combined with providing highly specified products with the highest quality standards at competitive prices, we have developed a leadership position in each of our core markets. In the United States, which is our largest market, we were ranked as the second largest glass fabricator as well as the second largest metal company serving the United States in 2020 by Glass Magazine. In addition, we believe we are the leading glass transformation company in Colombia. Our customers, which include developers, general contractors or installers for hotels, office buildings, shopping centers, airports, universities, hospitals and multi-family and residential buildings, look to us as a value-added partner based on our product development capabilities, our high-quality products and our unwavering commitment to exceptional service.
 
We have more than 35 years of experience in architectural glass and aluminum profile structure assembly. We transform a variety of glass products, including tempered safety, double thermo-acoustic and laminated glass. Our finished glass products are installed in a wide variety of buildings across a number of different applications, including floating facades, curtain walls, windows, doors, handrails, and interior and bathroom spatial dividers. We also produce aluminum products such as profiles, rods, bars, plates and other hardware used in the manufacturing of windows.
 
Our products are manufactured in a 2.7 million square foot, state-of-the-art manufacturing complex in Barranquilla, Colombia that provides easy access to North, Central and South America, the Caribbean and the Pacific. Our products can be found on some of the most distinctive buildings in these regions, including El Dorado Airport (Bogota), 50 United Nations Plaza (New York), Trump Plaza (Panama), Icon Bay (Miami), and Salesforce Tower (San Francisco). Our track record of successfully delivering high profile projects has earned us an increasing number of opportunities across the United States, evidenced by our expanding backlog and overall revenue growth.
 
Our structural competitive advantage is underpinned by our low-cost manufacturing footprint, vertically integrated business model and geographic location. Our integrated facilities in Colombia and distribution and services operations in Florida provide us with a significant cost advantage in both manufacturing and distribution, and we continue to invest in these operations to expand our operational capabilities. Our lower cost manufacturing footprint allows us to offer competitive prices for our customers, while also providing innovative, high quality and high value-added products, together with consistent and reliable service. We have historically generated high margin organic growth based on our position as a value-added solutions provider for our customers.
 
We have a strong presence in the Florida market, which represents a substantial portion of our revenue stream and backlog. Our success in Florida has primarily been achieved through sustained organic growth, with further penetration now taking place into other highly populated areas of the United States. As part of our strategy to become a fully vertically integrated company, we have supplemented our organic growth with some acquisitions that have allowed us added control over our supply chain allowed for further vertical integration of our business and will act as a platform for our future expansion in the United States. In 2016, we completed the acquisition of ESW, which gave us control over the distribution of products into the United States from our manufacturing facilities in Colombia. In March 2017, we completed the acquisition of GM&P, a consulting and glazing installation business that was previously our largest installation customer.
 
The continued diversification of the group’s presence and product portfolio is a core component of our strategy. In particular, we are actively seeking to expand our presence in United States outside of Florida. Since 2017, we have been expanding our presence in U.S. residential markets which went from around 5% of our sales nearly 20% of our revenues for the full year 2020. We believe that the quality of our products, coupled with our ability to price competitively given our structural advantages on cost, will allow us to generate further growth in the future.

Competitive Strengths
 
Our success has been grounded in our ability to offer high quality products at the most competitive prices. We are able to competitively price our products, while still achieving strong margins, due to a number of unique cost advantages. In addition to our vertically integrated business model, we benefit from structural cost advantages in manufacturing and distribution due to our geographic location. Alongside these structural advantages, we are committed to quality, product innovation and customer service. We believe these competitive strengths create a significant barrier to entry, which is underpinned and sustained by the experience of our senior management team and the loyalty of our highly motivated employees.
Vertical Integration
 
We believe we are unique within the industry in vertically integrating the purchasing of raw materials and the manufacturing, distribution and installation of our products. By vertically integrating each of these functions, we are able to eliminate inefficiencies throughout the supply chain and generate strong margins. These efficiencies are only enhanced as our business grows and we benefit from operating leverage and economies of scale. In particular, our joint venture with Saint-Gobain has solidified our vertical integration strategy by providing us with an interest in the first stage of our production chain, while securing ample glass supply for our expected production needs.
 
This business model also allows us to maintain strict quality control, from the sourcing of input materials to the installation of our finished products. Our vertically integrated business model therefore enables us to provide consistent high-quality products to our end-customers. Ownership of the entire production process also reduces our dependence on third parties, allowing us to respond more quickly to our customers’ needs and reducing lead-times for new or customized products.
 
Cost of Production Advantages
 
We enjoy significant cost advantages because of our location in Colombia that we would not be able to realize if our production facility was located in the United States. We believe we are able to offer competitive prices, in part, as a result of our low labor and energy costs relative to those in the United States while maintaining efficient transportation costs into the markets we serve. Employees at our manufacturing facilities in Colombia earn above the local minimum wage, yet these wages are typically less than one quarter of the cost of a comparable employee located within the United States. In 2018, we completed a solar panel project with the capacity to generate approximately five megawatts of eco-friendly energy on-site at our manufacturing facilities. This investment has allowed us to reduce energy costs, while also having a positive tax effect due to our ability to deduct the investment from our taxable income in compliance with applicable Colombian tax regulations.
 
Low-Cost Distribution
 
Our principal manufacturing facility is located in Barranquilla, Colombia, which is strategically located near three of the country’s major ports: Barranquilla, Cartagena and Santa Marta. These ports provide us with maritime access to all major global markets. The Barranquilla port is just 16 kilometers away from our production facility. From there, our products can be shipped to Miami in three days and New York in four days. In addition, for short lead-time projects, our products can be transported by air from Barranquilla to Houston or Miami within a few hours.
 
As a result of the significant trade imbalance between Colombia and the United States for goods transported in container ships, we are able to transport our products to the United States in containers that would otherwise return empty to the United States. We are therefore able to distribute our products to the eastern, southern and western regions of the United States at very attractive rates, which are often lower than a comparable domestic land shipment within the United States. Demand for high-specification architectural glass is typically highest in large coastal cities, which we are able to ship to directly, while most of our competitors must utilize relatively expensive land transportation services to deliver finished goods to these sites.

Commitment to Quality and Innovation
 
Our commitment to quality is evidenced by our significant recent investments in machinery and equipment. Since 2012, we have invested nearly $300 million in the latest technologies to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of our production lines, and ultimately to improve the quality of the products that we deliver to our customers. We believe these significant investments position us to meet our growth objectives over the next several years. We operate state-of-the-art glass making equipment, glass laminating lines, aluminum presses and high-volume insulating equipment which facilitate more precise manufacturing, enabling us to offer a broader selection of and higher quality products and remain agile in responding to customer demands, while generating less raw material waste.
 
We believe our investments in technology within recent years have positioned us well for continued growth, improved profitability and enhanced cash generation in the years ahead. Recent examples of our high return investments within the last two years include:
 

● | Completing the automation of two centralized aluminum warehouses for storing, sorting and delivering aluminum profiles to our internal production processes that reduce lead times for the assembly of architectural systems and reduce on-site damage to materials, 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The automation of two complete glass transformation lines with an automated glass sorting and processing system, which increased the capacity of two of our ten production lines by over 160% (or 10% of our total production capacity) while reducing employee headcount, process lead time and breakage which entered into operation toward the end of 2019; and 
● | A complete aluminum transformation line, which includes an additional furnace, extrusion press and a vertical paint line, which expanded our aluminum production capacity in tons by roughly 29% and which entered into operation in mid-2019. 

 
Our quality assurance department maintains rigorous oversight over the production process to ensure the consistent production of high quality products. In addition, we adhere to quality standards that meet all guidelines and requirements for the Insulating Glass Certification Council (IGCC) and Safety Glazing Certification Council (SGCC) certification programs.
 
Finally, our commitment to quality also extends to our partnerships and alliances. Most notably, for certain products we offer Kuraray Sentryglass®. These laminated glass interlayers are five times stronger than conventional laminating materials.
 
On September 20, 2018, we entered an agreement with Schüco USA LLLP (“Schüco”), a division of the Schüco International KG, a worldwide leader of architectural systems headquartered in Germany, with more than 60 years of experience and a presence in over 80 countries. Schüco is known for its expertise in the innovative design of building envelopes, windows, doors and facade systems, for the construction industry. This agreement enables Tecnoglass to manufacture and sell Schüco’s architectural systems to customers in North, Central and South America, alongside our existing ESWindows products. Additionally, Tecnoglass will extrude and paint aluminum profile designs as part of Schüco’s global supply chain primarily for products sold in the United States. This agreement allows Tecnoglass to expand its portfolio and offer more solutions to its clients with high-end, renowned designs.
 
Superior Customer Service
 
In addition to manufacturing high quality products at competitive prices, our customer value proposition is supplemented by short lead-times, on-time delivery and after-sale support. Through the coordinated efforts of our sales teams, product specialists and field service teams, we deliver high quality service to our customers, from the initial order to the delivery and installation of our products. We believe our ability to accompany our clients throughout every phase of their projects’ engineering, consulting, manufacturing and installation along with our ability to coordinate these efforts as a one-stop-shop is a key differentiator from our competition.

High Barriers to Entry
 
The ability of new competitors to enter the markets that we serve is limited due to the technical certifications required on high specification building projects, such as IGCC, IqNet Icontec 14001 and ISO9001. We attribute our success, in large part, to our ability to produce a broad range of sophisticated products, as well as our reputation for delivering high quality, made-to-order architectural glass on time. Our employees have extensive training, knowledge and experience at manufacturing high specification products. We believe the vertically-integrated nature of our operations means that there are high barriers to successfully entering our markets and competing with us on price, quality and agility. In addition, the equipment needed to operate in the glass and window industry is expensive, therefore requiring significant upfront capital investment.
Loyal and Highly Motivated Employees
 
Capitalizing on our various competitive advantages also requires a skilled and dedicated workforce. We actively encourage and facilitate the development of our employees through rolling training programs, with multiple training sessions held every week. These programs increase the skills of our employees and are designed to allow our employees to keep pace with the new technologies being installed at our manufacturing facilities. We are committed to developing our employees and remaining at the forefront of technology in our industry. These investments have also helped us manage workplace injuries, with our rate of one accident per 37 workers per year, being substantially lower than the average of one accident per 12 workers per year for manufacturing companies in Colombia.
 
We value our employees and invest in them and in our local communities. For several decades, our Tecnoglass ES Windows Foundation has committed resources to create projects aimed to assist and contribute to the development of the region. Through the foundation´s scholarship program, over 212 students were benefited in 2020, with grants to access higher education in different universities of Colombia. Our foundation provides funding for different local schools and institutions, looking to improve social transformation and community development. Additionally, the foundation collaborates with multiples institutions to encourage sports and healthy habits in the younger generations. During a challenging 2020, the foundation went much further and delivered 38.000 food aids and 2.210 tons of food to local communities, helping both families and farmers, working hand in hand with the Archdiocesan Food Bank Foundation. Also, Covid-19 prevention and awareness campaigns were executed with the distribution of 200.000 facemasks, by 30 volunteers, to families with no resources; this was accompanied by educational material, to help mitigate the number of people infected by this virus.
 
This and other initiatives have allowed us to maintain a strong relationship with the communities and our employees. We continuously strive to make a difference for our people, contributing to building a better future for the region and our country.
 
Strategy
 
We have identified the following strategic priorities that we believe are important in advancing our business:
 
Further Geographic Penetration in the United States
 
We have successfully established a leading reputation in the Florida construction market by providing high value, impact-resistant architectural glass products. Our products have become widely regarded in Florida for their quality and are certified in compliance with all U.S. regulations.
 
Sales in Florida comprised 72% of United States revenue in the year ended December 31, 2020. In recent years, we have begun to successfully grow our geographic presence in the United States outside of Florida, particularly into markets along the east coast, and as a result, 25% of our U.S. backlog is for projects outside of Florida. Coastal markets are particularly attractive to us, as they can be directly accessed by ship, resulting in transportation costs from our manufacturing facilities that are similar to our transportation costs to Florida. These regions are also affected by hurricanes, significant temperature fluctuations and other extreme forms of weather that foster demand for our products. We are actively expanding our sales presence in these costal markets and have already successfully completed several projects in large U.S. markets such as New York, Boston, Washington D.C. and Baltimore as well as cities along the U.S. Gulf Coast, such as Houston.

We intend to continue growing the business organically outside of Florida. As we explore growth opportunities in new U.S. markets, we intend to leverage the strong reputation we have developed with national commercial construction contractors, architects and designers for providing high quality products at the most competitive prices.
 
Penetrate the U.S. Residential Market
 
In April 2017 we launched “ES Windows: Elite Collection” and “ES Windows: Prestige Collection” to target the U.S. residential new and replacement sectors. We have received a great interest for the new products to date and positive reactions from our customers. Nowadays, residential sales represent a considerable portion of our total revenues and we believe we will continue growing into this end market in the U.S through share gains, new products and a solid execution. This year we had a significant demand in the U.S. residential market, representing 21% of our total sales for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 3% as of 2017. The U.S. private residential construction market exceeded $690 billion in spending during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 according to the United States Census Bureau. Residential housing starts in the US increased by 5.8% during 2020, according to the US Census Bureau. We believe that our core strengths that have facilitated our success to date, namely the quality of our products and the structural cost advantages that allows us to price our products competitively, will similarly contribute to our ongoing success and continued penetration into the U.S residential end market.
 
Continued Investment in Technology to Meet Evolving Demands
 
We have a track record of developing innovative new products, and we intend to continue our focus on new product opportunities in the future. We are constantly identifying shifts in global trends and customer needs, and designing new products to meet those changes in demand. In order to continue this success, it is critical that we invest in the latest technologies available in our industry. For example, with the installation of our soft-coating facility, we are now able to manufacture low emissivity glass that is energy efficient and will allow us to meet growing demand for “green” products.
 
We operate state-of-the-art architectural glass making equipment, glass laminating lines, aluminum presses and high-volume insulating equipment, which facilitate more precise manufacturing and generate less raw material waste. We will seek to leverage this platform of cutting-edge equipment to adapt our products to evolving demands in both current and new markets. We expect that our focus on innovation, which is founded upon our investments in technology, will position us well to take advantage of new opportunities.
 
The Company is carrying out enhancements at its glass and aluminum facilities to increase production capacity and automate operations. The Company anticipates that these high return investments speed up production processes. The Company improved efficiency in its glass production during 2020 by automating certain processes to increase capacity, while reducing material waste and overall lead times, which entered operations in late 2019. Additionally, in 2020 we completed the automation of two centralized aluminum warehouses for storing, sorting and delivering aluminum profiles to our internal production processes that reduce lead times for the assembly of architectural systems and reduce on-site damage to materials and we expect will have a positive impact to our working capital through more effective inventory management. The Company expects to continue funding these capital investments mainly with cash on hand.
 
Rigorous Adherence to Quality Standards
 
Maintaining the high quality standards for which we have become known is essential to the execution of our strategy. All of our internal processes are continually and independently supervised by Tecnoglass’ Quality Assurance department. The Quality Assurance department maintains rigorous oversight of optimization indicators covering energy, water, recyclable waste and other facets of the production process. Constant monitoring of these indicators is integral to ensuring that we consistently produce high quality products. Between 5% and 10% of our production is randomly selected to verify compliance with a variety of quality standards, such as water leaks, functionality, manufacturing and accessories, according to ASTM International (ASTM) and American Architectural Manufacturers Association (AAMA) rules.
 
These measures allow us to effectively detect issues and take specific actions to mitigate their reoccurrence. As we grow and our use of technology evolves, our Quality Assurance team must also evolve its tests, controls and remedies. We believe this rigorous adherence to quality control will ensure that we will continue to provide the highest quality products and, ultimately, promote customer satisfaction.

Sales, Marketing and Customer Service
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Our sales strategy primarily focuses on attracting and retaining customers by consistently providing exceptional customer service, leading product quality, and competitive pricing. Our customers also value our shorter lead times, knowledge of building code requirements and technical expertise, which collectively generate significant customer loyalty. We primarily market our products based on product quality, outstanding service, shorter lead times and on-time delivery.
 
Our products are marketed using a combination of internal sales representatives, independent sales representatives and directly to distributors. We believe this strategy is highly efficient for our business. Our internal sales representatives receive a portion of their performance-based compensation based on sales and profitability metrics. Additionally, some of our sales and marketing efforts are handled by area sales representatives who work on a commission basis.
 
We do not rely on significant traditional advertising expenditures to drive net sales. We have established and maintain credibility primarily through the strength of our products, our customer service and quality assurance, the speed at which we deliver finished products and the attractiveness of our pricing. Our advertising expenditures consist primarily of maintaining our subsidiaries’ websites.
 
Customer Service
 
We believe that our ability to provide customers outstanding service quality serves as a strong competitive differentiator. Our customer relationships are established and maintained through the coordinated efforts of our sales and production teams. We employ a highly responsive and efficient team of professionals devoted to addressing customer support with the goal of resolving any issue in a timely manner. In order to promote customer loyalty and employee development, we developed an employee training program with the primary objectives of educating our staff to be aware of client and supplier needs and familiarizing them with our strategic goals in order to improve the competitiveness, productivity and quality of all products offered.
Working Capital Requirements
 
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated $71.4 million cash from operating activities. The positive cashflow from operations during 2020 is related to record high operating profit margins, enhanced working capital efforts, easing working capital requirements to serve tapered sales during the period, and our efforts to preserve cash and solidify our liquidity position and preparedness as we continue to weather through the pandemic.

Customers
 
Our customers include architects, building owners, general contractors and glazing subcontractors in the commercial construction market. We have over 1,000 customers. Of our 100 most representative customers, which represent over 87% of our sales, about 96% are located in North America and 4% in South America. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Materials and Suppliers
 
Our primary manufacturing materials include glass, ionoplast, polyvinyl butyral, and aluminum and vinyl extrusions. Although in some instances we have agreements with our suppliers, these agreements are generally terminable by us or the supplier counterparties on limited notice. Typically, all of our materials are readily available from a number of sources, and no supplier delays or shortages are anticipated.
 
We source raw materials and glass necessary to manufacture our products from a variety of domestic and foreign suppliers. During the year ended December 31, 2020 four suppliers individually accounted for more than 10% of total raw material purchases, which in aggregate represented 47% of raw material purchases, including Vidrio Andino SAS, from which we purchased 13% of our raw material purchases, and with whom we created a joint venture in May 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2019 three suppliers individually accounted for more than 10% of total raw material purchases, which in aggregate represented 37% of raw material purchases, including Vidrio Andino, from whom we purchased 10%.
 
Warranties
 
We offer product warranties, which we believe are competitive for the markets in which our products are sold. The nature and extent of these warranties depend upon the product. Our standard warranties are generally from five to ten years for architectural glass, curtain wall, laminated and tempered glass, window and door products. Warranties are not priced or sold separately and do not provide the customer with services or coverages in addition to the assurance that the product complies with original agreed-upon specifications. In the event of a claim against a product for which we have received a warranty from the supplier, we transfer the claim back to the supplier.
 
The cost associated with product warranties was $681 and $2,453 during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Competitors
 
We have local and international competitors that also focus on glass and aluminum transformation, window ensemble and installation and designing in the commercial and residential construction markets. The market in the United States in which we compete is mainly comprised of manufacturers, distributors and installers of glass curtain walls, windows and doors for commercial and residential buildings. Based on our analysis of IBIS World Report, we estimate that we capture 1% of the US consolidated market by revenue (manufacturing and services), which represents an attractive opportunity for further penetration. In Colombia, we believe we are the leading producer of high-end windows, with more than 35 years of experience in the glass and aluminum structure assembly market. The industry has a few well-known players and is mostly atomized and comprised of small competitors.
 
The key factors on which we and our competitors compete for business include: quality, price, reputation, breadth of products and service offerings, and production speed. We face intense competition from both smaller and larger market players who compete against us in our various markets including glass, window and aluminum manufacturing.
 
The principal methods of competition in the window and door industry are the development of long-term relationships with window and door distributors and dealers, and the retention of customers by delivering a full range of high-quality customized products on demand with short turnaround times while offering competitive pricing. The vertical integration of our operations, our geographic scope, low labor costs and economies of scale have helped our subsidiaries consolidate their leading position in Colombia and bolstered their expansion in the United States and other foreign markets.
 
Government Regulations
 
We are subject to extensive and varied federal, state and local government regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to zoning and density, building design and safety, hurricane and floods, construction, and similar matters. In particular, the market for our impact-resistant windows and doors depends in large part on our ability to satisfy state and local building codes that require protection from wind-borne debris. Additionally, certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate require that installation of doors and windows be approved by competent authorities that grant distribution licenses. We have invested significantly in our quality assurance department in order to maintain rigorous oversight over the production process to ensure the consistent production of high quality products. We have been certified in compliance with rigorous safety standards, as described in more detail in the section titled “—Certifications.” We are also subject to laws and regulations relating to our relationships with our employees, public health and safety and fire codes. Although our business and facilities are subject to federal, state and local environmental regulation, environmental regulation does not have a material impact on our operations.

Human Capital
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of 5,583 employees, none of whom is represented by a union. As of December 31, 2019 we had a total of 5,543 employees. Most of our employees are hired through seven temporary staffing companies and are employed under one-year fixed-term employment contracts. We actively encourage and facilitate the development of our employees through rolling training programs, with multiple training sessions held on a weekly basis. These programs increase the skills of our employees and are designed to allow our employees to keep pace with the new technologies being installed at our manufacturing facilities. We are committed to developing our employees and remaining at the forefront of technology in our industry. These investments have also helped us manage workplace injuries, with our rate of one accident per 37 workers per year, being substantially lower than the average of one accident per 12 workers per year for manufacturing companies in Colombia. We have remained union-free since ES’s incorporation in 1984. The Company considers itself an equal opportunity employer and has constantly sought to seek the best talent irrespective of gender or ethnicity. While the jobs associated to the core operations are predominantly filled by males, the company´s sales and administrative staff is comprised of approximately 40% females and 60% males. From an ethnicity perspective, our labor force is diverse but predominantly Latino based on our location.
