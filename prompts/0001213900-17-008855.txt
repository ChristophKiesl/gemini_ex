Item 1. Business
Introduction
 
We are a blank check company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands as a business company with limited liability. This means that our shareholders have no additional liability for the company’s liabilities over and above the amount paid for their shares. We were formed for the purpose of acquiring, engaging in a share exchange, share reconstruction and amalgamation with, contractual control arrangement with, purchasing all or substantially all of the assets of, or engaging in any other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities.
 
Prior to December 27, 2016, our efforts were limited to organizational activities, our initial public offering, and the search for a suitable acquisition target. On December 27, 2016, we entered into a Merger Agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) with Borqs International Holding Corp, an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands with limited liability (“Borqs”), PAAC Merger Subsidiary Limited, an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands with limited liability and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pacific (“Merger Sub”), our sponsor, in the capacity as the representative from and after the Effective Time (as defined below) for the shareholders of Pacific other than the shareholders of Borqs as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and their successors and assignees, Zhengdong Zou, in the capacity as the representative from and after the Effective Time for the shareholders of Borqs as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and for certain limited purposes thereof, our sponsor. The Merger Agreement was subsequently amended on May 10, 2017 and on June 29, 2017.
 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, as amended, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, at the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Closing”), Merger Sub will merge with and into Borqs, with Borqs continuing as the surviving entity (the “Merger”). As a result of the consummation of the Merger, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the holders of Borqs issued and outstanding capital shares will receive ordinary shares of Pacific, the holders of Borqs issued and outstanding warrants will receive replacement warrants to acquire ordinary shares of Pacific (“Replacement Warrants”), and the holders of Borqs issued and outstanding options will have their options assumed by Pacific and will instead acquire ordinary shares of Pacific upon exercise of such options (the “Business Combination”).
 
On July 14, 2017, we filed the Proxy Statement. On August 10, 2017, we held a special meeting of shareholders to approve the Business Combination. The Business Combination and related proposals, including (i) a proposal to amend our memorandum and articles of association to (A) remove or amend those provisions of our charter which terminate or otherwise cease to be applicable following the consummation of the Business Combination, (2) give our board of directors the ability to reclassify the board, and if necessary modify existing terms, into up to three classes at any time after the consummation of the Business Combination and (3) in the case of certain future acquisitions by us (x) if having a value in excess of $60 million, require at least two-thirds of the directors then-serving on the board to approve any such acquisitions that close on or before June 30, 2018, (y) grant the Sponsor and the Purchaser Representative (as defined in the Merger Agreement) certain information rights relating to such acquisitions, and (z) if requested by the Sponsor or the Purchaser Representative, to provide a fairness opinion in respect of such acquisitions (such amendments to be adopted by way of the amendment and restatement of the charter in the form of the Amended Charter), (ii) a proposal to approve and adopt the Borqs Technologies, Inc. 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, (iii) a proposal to approve, for purposes of complying with applicable Nasdaq listing rules, the issuance of more than 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares and (iv) a proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date, if necessary, were approved at such meeting. Concurrently with the consummation of the Business Combination, we will provide our shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. In connection with the meeting, 3,841,131 of our public shares were validly presented to us for redemption. The parties are seeking to satisfy or negotiate waivers to any remaining closing conditions to the proposed business combination. Without satisfying all remaining closing conditions or receiving all waivers, no assurance can be made as to whether the proposed business combination will be consummated. If we do not consummate the Business Combination by the close of business on August 21, 2017, we will be required to dissolve and liquidate our trust account by returning the then remaining funds in such account to our then-public shareholders. The description of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which was filed with the SEC on the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 3, 2017, the First Amendment to the Merger Agreement, which was filed with the SEC on the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 12, 2017, the Second Amendment to the Merger Agreement, which was filed with SEC on the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 3, 2017, and the Proxy Statement filed on July 14, 2017. You are urged to read the entire Merger Agreement and the other exhibits attached thereto.
 
Additional information about the proposed Business Combination, the business of Borqs and the special meeting are available, without charge, at the SEC’s website (http://www.sec.gov). Other than specific references to the Business Combination, the discussion in this Annual Report is as of June 30, 2017.
 
Significant Activities Since Inception
 
On October 20, 2015, we consummated our initial public offering of 5,000,000 units. Each unit consists of one ordinary share, no par value per share, one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one ordinary share upon consummation of our initial business combination and one warrant to purchase one-half of one ordinary share at an exercise price of $12.00 per full share. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $50,000,000 (before underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses). Simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering, we completed the private placement of 477,500 units, issued to our sponsor and to the lead underwriter of our initial public offering, generating gross proceeds of $4,775,000.

On October 23, 2015, the underwriters of our initial public offering exercised their over-allotment option in full, purchasing 750,000 units at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $7,500,000. On October 23, 2015, simultaneously with the sale of the over-allotment units, the Company completed a private placement with our sponsor and the lead underwriter of our initial public offering for an additional 54,375 units, generating gross proceeds of $543,750.
 
A total of $59.8 million of the net proceeds from the IPO (including the over-allotment) and the private placements were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders.
 
Our units began trading on October 15, 2015 on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “PAACU.” Commencing on October 29, 2015, the common stock, rights and warrants comprising the units began separate trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbols “PAAC,” “PAACR” and “PAACW,” respectively.
 
In connection with the Company’s April 19, 2017 special meeting in lieu of the 2017 annual meeting of shareholders to approve an extension of the date to complete an initial business combination from April 20, 2017 to August 21, 2017 (the “Extension Meeting”), a total of 653,996 ordinary shares were redeemed. As a result, an aggregate of approximately $6.8 million (or approximately $10.40 per share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders.
 
As indicated in the Company’s proxy statement and related supplement for the Extension Meeting, our sponsor agreed to contribute to the Company as a loan $0.03 for each public share that was not redeemed, for each calendar month (commencing on April 20, 2017 and on the 20th day of each subsequent month), or portion thereof, that is needed by the Company to complete an initial business combination from April 20, 2017 until August 21, 2017, to be deposited in the trust account within seven calendar days from the beginning of such calendar month (or portion thereof). Accordingly, our sponsor agreed to contribute an aggregate of approximately $153,000 (the “Contribution”) to the Company within seven calendar days from the beginning of each such calendar month (or portion thereof), with the initial Contribution contributed by April 27, 2017. If the Company takes the full time through August 21, 2017 to complete the initial business combination (which is currently anticipated), the redemption amount per share at the meeting for such an initial business combination or the Company’s subsequent liquidation will be approximately $10.52 per share. The amount of the Contribution will not bear interest and will be repayable by the Company to the sponsor upon consummation of an initial business combination. As of August 15, our sponsor has contributed an aggregate of $612,000 into the trust account.
 
Merger Agreement
 
As discussed above, on December 27, 2016, we entered into a Merger Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, the Company will effect an acquisition of Borqs.
 
The Merger shall become effective at the time when the Plan of Merger is registered by the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands. As a result of the consummation of the Merger, at the Effective Time, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the holders of the issued and outstanding shares in the share capital of Borqs will receive Pacific ordinary shares, the holders of Borqs issued and outstanding warrants will receive Replacement Warrants, and the holders of Borqs issued and outstanding options will have their options assumed by Pacific and will instead acquire Assumed Options.
 
The total number of Pacific ordinary shares to be received by Sellers at the Effective Time (the “Merger Consideration Shares”) will be based on the adjusted equity valuation of Borqs as of the Closing, with such adjusted equity valuation divided by US$10.40. The adjusted equity valuation of Borqs as of the Closing will be determined by starting with a base valuation of US$270.0 million, deducting the amount of indebtedness (net of cash) of Borqs as of the last business day before the Closing (but treating any amounts contingent upon the Closing as not being contingent) (the “Reference Time”), increasing such valuation to the extent that the net working capital (excluding indebtedness and cash) of Borqs as of the Reference Time is greater than US$11.0 million or decreasing such valuation to the extent that the net working capital (excluding indebtedness and cash) of Borqs as of the Reference Time is less than US$9.0 million, and increasing such valuation to the extent that Pacific’s outside accounting and legal expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation, preparation and consummation of the Merger Agreement (but excluding any deferred initial public offering costs or costs incurred with any Commitment Investment or any costs incurred in connection with an extension of Pacific’s deadline to consummate a business combination, if sought) exceed US$1.0 million. The adjusted equity valuation will be determined by mutual agreement of Borqs and Pacific based on estimates of the foregoing factors as of the Closing, without any post-Closing adjustments.

Of the Merger Consideration Shares to be issued, between 2,352,285 and 3,846,154 of such shares will be contingent and deposited in escrow (together with any equity securities paid as dividends or distributions with respect to such shares or into which such shares are exchanged or converted, the “Earnout Shares”) to be released (or with respect to the Backstop Guarantee Shares and Commitment Escrow Shares, as described below, to be cancelled in connection with an issuance of replacement shares by Pacific) to the Sellers in the event certain net income earnout conditions are met during the period from July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018. Four percent (4%) of (a) the shares otherwise due to the Sellers at the Closing (excluding any Earnout Shares), or approximately 885,315 shares assuming that the full 3,846,154 Earnout Shares are issued and that, based on the unaudited pro forma financial statements included in this proxy statement, the adjusted equity valuation of Borqs is $270,182,000 as of the closing and (b) any Earnout Shares earned by the Sellers (collectively, the “Indemnity Escrow Shares”, and together any other dividends, distributions or other income on the Indemnity Escrow Shares, the “Indemnity Escrow Property”) will be deposited in escrow to support certain indemnification obligations under the Merger Agreement, and released on the 18 month anniversary of the Closing, subject to amounts reserved for indemnification claims then pending or unpaid (the “Escrow Indemnification Period”). Each Borqs shareholder as of the Effective Time (each, a “Seller”) will receive its pro rata portion of the Merger Consideration Shares, less its pro rata portion of the Earnout Shares and the Indemnity Escrow Shares as described above, based on the number of Borqs shares held by such Seller (with any Borqs preferred shares treated on an as-converted into Borqs ordinary share basis), except that any Seller who validly exercises dissenters rights under Part XVI of the Companies Law (2016 Revision) of the Cayman Islands will not be entitled to receive its pro rata share of the Merger Consideration Shares.
 
The number of Earnout Shares due to the Sellers shall be based on the consolidated net income of Pacific and its subsidiaries, subject to certain adjustments (the “Adjusted Net Income”), for the twelve month period from July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018 (the “Earnout Period”). The exact number of Earnout Shares will be based on the aggregate of the funds left in Pacific’s trust account after redemptions in connection with the Merger and the proceeds from any third party equity financing to be conducted by Pacific prior to the closing of the Merger, including pursuant to the Backstop and any Commitment Investment (the “Closing Proceeds”), with there being 2,352,285 Earnout Shares if the Closing Proceeds are $24.0 million and the number of Earnout Shares increasing on a linear sliding scale, up to 3,846,154 Earnout Shares if the Closing Proceeds are $57.5 million. In order for the Sellers to receive the full Earnout Shares, Pacific will need to achieve at least $20.0 million in Adjusted Net Income during the Earnout Period, and if the Adjusted Net Income is greater than $18.0 million but less than $20.0 million, the Sellers will receive a pro-rated amount of the Earnout Shares on a linear sliding scale with zero Earnout Shares earned at $18.0 million in Adjusted Net Income and the full Earnout Shares earned at $20.0 million in Adjusted Net Income. We believe that the aggregate funds left in the trust account and private placement after the redemption of 3,841,131 of our public shares and the Closing Proceeds pursuant to the Backstop and any Commitment Investment will aggregate $24.0 million. 
 
Between 1,282,051 and 2,352,285 of the Earnout Shares (the “Backstop Guarantee Shares”) will be issued in the name of the sponsor in consideration of entering into the Backstop and Subscription Agreement (as described below). To the extent there is any Commitment Investment, up to 2,564,103 of the Earnout Shares (the “Commitment Escrow Shares”) will be issued in the name of qualified institutional buyers or institutional accredited investors who enter into agreements with the Purchaser to commit to purchase or otherwise continue to own (and not redeem) Purchaser Ordinary Shares through the Closing (the “Commitment Investors”) pursuant to such Commitment Investment. Commitment Investors will be allocated Commitment Escrow Shares at a rate equal to approximately 44,593 Commitment Escrow Shares per $1,000,000 of committed investment, and the total number of Commitment Escrow Shares will depend on the amount of aggregate investment from all Commitment Investors. The Commitment Escrow Shares will be derived from either the Backstop Guarantee Shares or the Net Income Shares, depending on the amount and source of the funds left in Pacific’s trust account after redemptions. Any remaining Earnout Shares, after accounting for the Backstop Guarantee Shares and the Commitment Escrow Shares (the “Net Income Shares”), will be issued in the name of the Sellers and deposited into escrow.
 
The sponsor and the Commitment Investors will be entitled to all voting rights and dividend rights (other than equity securities paid as dividends) with respect to the Backstop Guarantee Shares and the Commitment Escrow Shares while they are held in escrow. The Sellers will be entitled to all voting rights and dividend rights (other than equity securities paid as dividends) with respect to the Net Income Shares while such Net Income Shares are held in escrow. To the extent the Earnout conditions are not met, the Backstop Guarantee Shares will be released to the sponsor, the Commitment Escrow Shares will be released to the Commitment Investors, and the Net Income Shares will be cancelled. To the extent that the Earnout conditions are met or partially met, the resulting portion of Backstop Guarantee Shares and the Commitment Escrow Shares will be cancelled and equivalent replacement shares will be issued to the Sellers, and the resulting portion of Net Income Shares will be released to the Sellers; in each case, 4% of all such shares will be deposited in escrow and added to the existing indemnity escrow as described in further detail below. The indemnity escrow will be the sole source to pay for the Sellers’ indemnification obligations under the Merger Agreement, to be released on the 18 month anniversary of the Closing, subject to amounts reserved for indemnification claims then pending or unpaid.

Holders of issued and outstanding Borqs warrants will receive Replacement Warrants, which will be subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as Pacific’s warrants issued as part of the units in Pacific’s IPO, except that the number of shares and exercise price thereunder will each be equitably adjusted for the Merger based on the number of Merger Consideration Shares as compared to the number of issued and outstanding Borqs shares immediately prior to the Effective Time.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the lock-up agreements to be entered into by each Seller and each holder of a Borqs warrant, Sellers will not transfer, assign or sell any remaining Merger Consideration Shares received and held outside of escrow or the Replacement Warrants for a period of one year from the closing of the Business Combination (which period may be shortened under certain circumstances).
 
Pacific will assume the obligations under the Assumed Options (including the applicable provisions of the plan under which they were issued), except that the number of shares and exercise price thereunder will be based on the number of Borqs shares and exercise price under the applicable Assumed Option, with each equitably adjusted for the Merger based on the number of Merger Consideration Shares as compared to the number of issued and outstanding Borqs shares immediately prior to the Effective Time.
 
Backstop and Subscription Agreement
 
In connection with the execution of an amendment to the Merger Agreement on May 10, 2017 (with such amendment further amended with the execution of a second amendment to Merger Agreement on June 29, 2017), Pacific and our sponsor entered into a Backstop and Subscription Agreement (the “Backstop and Subscription Agreement”) on May 11, 2017, pursuant to which our sponsor agreed to purchase up to $24.0 million of Pacific ordinary shares through (i) open market or privately negotiated transactions with third parties (with the sponsor not obligated to pay a price of greater than $10.40 per share), (ii) a private placement at a price of $10.40 per share with consummation to occur concurrently with that of the Business Combination or (iii) a combination thereof, in order to ensure that there is at least $24.0 million in Closing Proceeds (the “Backstop”), although the sponsor is entitled, at its sole election, to purchase additional Pacific ordinary shares in excess of such $24.0 million Closing Proceeds requirement. As consideration for the Backstop, the sponsor will be entitled to receive the Backstop Guarantee Shares subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, as amended. In connection with the Backstop and Subscription Agreement, at the Closing, Pacific and the sponsor will enter into a registration rights agreement, in a form to be agreed upon, with respect to the shares purchased in connection with the Backstop and Subscription Agreement and any Backstop Guarantee Shares released from escrow to and retained by the sponsor. We believe that the aggregate funds left in the trust account and private placement after the redemption of 3,841,131 of our public shares and the Closing Proceeds pursuant to the Backstop and any Commitment Investment will aggregate $24.0 million.
 
Pacific and Borqs may also obtain commitments from Commitment Investors to participate in a Commitment Investment to purchase Pacific’s ordinary shares through (i) open market or privately negotiated transactions with third parties, (ii) purchases of restricted shares to occur concurrently with that of the Business Combination, or (iii) a combination thereof. Any such Commitment Investors who participate in a Commitment Investment will have the right to receive Commitment Escrow Shares, and may receive registration rights in connection with the Commitment Investment. As of the date hereof, no such commitments have been made, and we are not required to obtain any such commitments.

Special Meeting of Shareholders
 
On August 10, 2017, we held a special meeting of shareholders to approve the Business Combination. At such meeting, the Business Combination and related proposals were approved. In connection with the meeting, 3,841,131 of our public shares were validly presented to us for redemption. Investors should review the Proxy Statement filed on July 14, 2017 for additional information regarding anticipated ownership.
Business Strategy
 
Our efforts in identifying prospective target businesses were not limited to a particular country, although we focused on businesses that have their primary operations located in Asia (with an emphasis on China). Our team consists of experienced financial services and accounting professionals, senior operating executives and directors of Asian companies. Our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), and directors have decades of experience in mergers, acquisitions and divestures of privately and publicly-held companies. Both our Chairman and CEO have been actively engaged in cross-border investments/divestments between the U.S. and Asia (with an emphasis on China) for several decades, while also assisting U.S. companies with expansion in China and vice versa since the early 1980s. Our independent directors are Chinese and U.S. citizens who have decades of experience in entrepreneurship, asset management/advisory services, and accounting & tax practices in China and U.S. We believe we will benefit from their accomplishments in Asia as well as in the U.S., and specifically their current activities in China market, in identifying attractive acquisition opportunities. However, there is no assurance that we will complete a business combination.
 
There was no restriction in the geographic location of targets we could pursue, although we prioritized geographic locations in Asia, and specifically China. We sought to identify targets that are likely to provide attractive financial returns through business combinations.
 
Our sponsor, Zhengqi International Holding Limited, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pacific Securities Investment Management Co., Ltd., a company incorporated in the People’s Republic of China and a wholly owned subsidiary of Pacific Securities Capital Management Co. Ltd., a company incorporated in the People’s Republic of China which, in turn, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pacific Securities Co. Ltd (601099.SH), or Pacific Securities, a company incorporated in the People’s Republic of China. Pacific Securities is a provider of financial, advisory, investment, and funds management services, primarily in China. Pacific Securities’ main business focus is generating returns to investors and stockholders by providing a diversified range of services to clients. Pacific Securities acts on behalf of institutional, corporate, and retail clients and counterparties around the world.
 
Investment Criteria
 
We had identified the following general criteria and guidelines, which we believed were important in evaluating prospective target businesses.
 

● | Middle-Market Growth Business. We sought to acquire one or more growth businesses with a total enterprise value of between $200,000,000 and $300,000,000. We believed that there were a substantial number of potential target businesses within this valuation range that can benefit from new capital for scalable operations to yield significant revenue and earnings growth. We did not intend to acquire either a start-up company, defined as a company that has not yet established commercial operations, or a company with negative cash flow. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Companies in Business Segments that are Strategically Significant to Asia or China. We sought to acquire those businesses with strong technological know-how, distribution networks and/or business practices in economic sectors experiencing significant Asia/China outbound investing. Such sectors included: Internet and high technology, clean energy, health care, consumer and retail, energy and resources, food processing, and manufacturing. 


5
-


● | Business with Revenue and Earnings Growth Potential. We sought to acquire one or more businesses that have the potential for significant revenue and earnings growth through a combination of both existing and new product development, increased production capacity, expense reduction and synergistic follow-on acquisitions resulting in increased operating leverage. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Companies with Potential for Strong Free Cash Flow Generation. We sought to acquire one or more businesses that have the potential to generate strong, stable and increasing free cash flow. We focused on businesses that have predictable revenue streams and definable low working capital and capital expenditure requirements. We also sought to leverage this cash flow in order to enhance shareholder value. 
● | Benefit from Being a Public Company. We intended to only acquire a business or businesses that would benefit from being publicly traded and which can effectively utilize access to broader sources of capital and a public profile that are associated with being a publicly traded company. 

 
These criteria were not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may have bene based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may have deemed relevant.
 
Effecting our initial business combination
 
We are not presently engaged in any operations. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination by issuing ordinary shares and/or paying cash as the consideration to the sellers of the acquired business.
 
We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would consummate such financing only simultaneously with the consummation of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law or the Nasdaq Capital Market, we would seek shareholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. As discussed above, in connection with the Business Combination, our sponsor agreed to purchase up to $24.0 million of Pacific ordinary shares through the Backstop, although our sponsor is entitled, at its sole election, to purchase additional Pacific ordinary shares in excess of such $24.0 million Closing Proceeds requirement.
 
Sources of target businesses
 
From the date of our IPO through execution of a non-binding letter of intent with Borqs on July 22, 2016, Pacific has identified and evaluated over 80 acquisition target companies.
 
Target business candidates were brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity groups, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses were brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources also introduced us to target businesses in which they thought we might be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources knew what types of businesses we were targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, also brought to our attention target business candidates that they became aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we received a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors.

-

 

We were not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we sought to complete our initial business combination with such a company, we, or a committee of independent directors, would have been required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that such an initial business combination is fair to our unaffiliated shareholders from a financial point of view. The proposed Business Combination with Borqs does not involve any affiliates of our sponsor, officers or directors.
 
Selection of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination
 
Subject to the requirement that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses or assets having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination, our management had virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we were not permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. In any case, we would only consummate an initial business combination in which we become the majority shareholder of the target (or control the target through contractual arrangements in limited circumstances for regulatory compliance purposes as discussed below) or were otherwise not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”).
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, and in evaluating Borqs in particular, we have conducted a thorough due diligence review which has encompassed, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information which will be made available to us.
 
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. The shareholders approved the Business Combination and related proposals at our special meeting of shareholders on August 10, 2017. Assuming all conditions to closing are met or otherwise waived, we expect to close the Business Combination by August 21, 2017. However, there are no assurances that the Business Combination will close by such date or at all.
 
Alternative structures to comply with regulations in certain Chinese industries
 
The PRC government has restricted or limited direct foreign ownership of certain kinds of assets and companies operating in a wide variety of industries, including certain aspects of telecommunications, advertising, food production, and heavy equipment manufacturers. As a result, it is not uncommon to employ alternative structures to acquire a target company. The Chinese government may apply these restrictions in other industries in the future. In addition, there can be restrictions on the foreign ownership of businesses that are determined from time to time to be in “important industries” that may affect the national economic security or having “famous Chinese brand names” or “well established Chinese brand names.” Subject to the review requirements of the Ministry of Commerce and other relevant agencies as discussed elsewhere for acquisitions of assets and companies in China and subject to the various percentage ownership limitations that exist from time to time, acquisitions involving foreign investors and parties in the various restricted categories of assets and industries may nonetheless sometimes be consummated using contractual arrangements with permitted Chinese parties which could, for example, result in a structure where, in exchange for our payment of the acquisition consideration, the target business would be majority or wholly owned by Chinese residents whom we designate, and the target business would continue to hold the requisite licenses necessary to operate its business. To the extent such agreements are employed, they may be for control of specific assets such as intellectual property or control of blocks of the equity ownership interests of a company. The agreements would be designed to secure for us economic benefits and to assume risk of losses and control over the subject assets or equity interests similar to the rights of full ownership, while leaving the technical ownership in the hands of Chinese parties.
 
For example, these contracts could result in a structure where, in exchange for our payment of the acquisition consideration: (i) the target company would be majority owned by Chinese residents whom would be likely designated by us and the target company would continue to hold the requisite licenses for the target business and (ii) we would establish a new subsidiary in China which would provide technology, technical support, consulting and related services to the target company in exchange for fees, which would transfer to us substantially all of the economic benefits of ownership of the target company.
 
These contractual arrangements would be designed to provide the following:
 
Our exercise of effective control over the target company;
 
We will assume economic benefits and risk of losses of the target company that are substantially similar to full ownership;
 

7
-

 

The shareholders of the target company would grant us a pledged interest in all of the issued and outstanding interests of the target company, including the right to vote such shares, as security for the performance of the target company’s obligations under the contractual arrangements;
 
The shareholders of the target company would grant us an irrevocable proxy for the maximum period permitted by law, to vote the shareholders’ shares in the target company in such manner and for or against such proposals as we may determine; and
 
We, or our designee, would have an exclusive option to purchase all or part of the equity interests in the target company owned by the Chinese residents whom we designate, or all or part of the assets of the target company, in each case when and to the extent permitted by Chinese regulations.
 
While we cannot predict the terms of any such contract that we will be able to negotiate, at a minimum, any contractual arrangement would need to provide us with effective control over the target’s operations and management either directly through board control or through affirmative and/or negative covenants and veto rights with respect to matters such as entry into material agreements, management changes and issuance of debt or equity securities, among other potential control provisions. We have not, however, established specific provisions which must be in an agreement in order to meet the definition of business combination.
 
These agreements likely also would provide for increased ownership or full ownership and control by us when and if permitted under Chinese law and regulation. If we choose to effect our initial business combination that employs the use of these types of control arrangements, we may have difficulty in enforcing our rights. Therefore, these contractual arrangements may not be as effective in providing us with the same economic benefits, accounting consolidation or control over a target business as would direct ownership through a merger or shares exchange. For example, if the target business or any other entity fails to perform its obligations under these contractual arrangements, we may have to incur substantial costs and expend substantial resources to enforce such arrangements, and rely on legal remedies under Chinese law, including seeking specific performance or injunctive relief, and claiming damages, which we cannot assure you will be sufficient to off-set the cost of enforcement and may adversely affect the benefits we expect to receive from the business combination.
 
We believe that under such contractual arrangement we will be considered the primary beneficiary and be able to consolidate financial results of the target company in our consolidated financial statements. However, in the event that in the future generally accepted accounting policies in the United States and the SEC accounting regulations change and we are deemed not to be the primary beneficiary by controlling the target company through such contractual arrangement, we would not be able to consolidate line by line the target company’s financial results in our consolidated financial statements.
 
Moreover, we expect that the contractual arrangements upon which we would be relying would be governed by Chinese law and would be the only basis of providing resolution of disputes which may arise through either arbitration or litigation in China. Accordingly, these contracts would be interpreted in accordance with Chinese law and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with Chinese legal procedures. Uncertainties in the Chinese legal system could limit our ability to enforce these contractual arrangements. In the event we are unable to enforce these contractual arrangements, we may not be able to exert the effective level of control over the target business.
 
Borqs utilizes the contractual arrangements described above and therefore, if we consummate the Business Combination, we would be subject to the uncertainties described above. As discussed in further detail in the Proxy Statement, we and our PRC counsel believe the ownership structure of Borqs, both currently and immediately after giving effect to the Business Combination, does not and will not violate any applicable PRC law or license currently in effect; and the contractual agreements by and among the Borqs entities and their respective shareholders are valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with their terms and applicable PRC laws and regulations currently in effect and will not violate any applicable PRC law currently in effect such as the PRC Laws regarding foreign ownership of Chinese businesses. However, there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current PRC laws. Accordingly, the PRC regulatory authorities and PRC courts may in the future take a view that is contrary to our views and the views of our PRC legal counsel. If the PRC courts or regulatory authorities determine that the contractual agreements violate applicable PRC laws, our contractual arrangements will become invalid or unenforceable.

Fair market value of target business or businesses
 
The target business or businesses or assets with which we effect our initial business combination must have a collective fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination. If we acquired less than 100% of one or more target businesses in our initial business combination, the aggregate fair market value of the portion or portions we acquire must have equaled at least 80% of the value of the trust account at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination. However, we would always acquire at least a controlling interest in a target business. The fair market value of a portion of a target business or assets would likely be calculated by multiplying the fair market value of the entire business by the percentage of the target we acquire. We could have sought to consummate our initial business combination with an initial target business or businesses with a collective fair market value in excess of the balance in the trust account. In order to consummate such an initial business combination, we could have issued a significant amount of debt, equity or other securities to the sellers of such business and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt, equity or other securities. If we issued securities in order to consummate such an initial business combination, our shareholders could end up owning a minority of the combined company’s voting securities as there is no requirement that our shareholders own a certain percentage of our company (or, depending on the structure of the initial business combination, an ultimate parent company that may be formed) after our business combination.
 
The fair market value of a target business or businesses or assets would be determined by our board of directors based upon standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as actual and potential gross margins, the values of comparable businesses, earnings and cash flow, book value and, where appropriate, upon the advice of appraisers or other professional consultants. If our board of directors was not able to independently determine that the target business or assets has a sufficient fair market value to meet the threshold criterion, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criterion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless we consummated a business combination with an affiliated entity, we were not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that the price we were paying was fair to our shareholders. We believe that the fair market value of Borqs is equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding taxes payable).
 
Lack of business diversification
 
For an indefinite period of time after consummation of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success might depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it was probable that we would not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By consummating our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:
 

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. 

 
Redemption rights for public shareholders upon consummation of our initial business combination
 
Concurrently with the consummation of the Business Combination, we provided our shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. The amount in the trust account was initially anticipated to be $10.40 per share. In connection with the Extension Meeting, a total of 653,996 ordinary shares were redeemed. In connection with the Extension Meeting, our sponsor agreed to contribute to us as a loan $0.03 for each public share that was not redeemed, for each calendar month (commencing on April 20, 2017 and on the 20th day of each subsequent month), or portion thereof, that is needed by us to complete the Business Combination or another business combination from April 20, 2017 until August 21, 2017. Each contribution will be deposited in the trust account established in connection with the IPO within seven calendar days from the beginning of such calendar month (or portion thereof). As of August 15, 2017, our sponsor has contributed an aggregate of $612,000. Accordingly, the redemption amount per share at the meeting for such business combination or our subsequent liquidation is approximately $10.52 per share. On August 10, 2017, we held a special meeting of shareholders to approve the Business Combination. At such meeting, the Business Combination and related proposals were approved. In connection with the meeting, 3,841,131 of our public shares were validly presented to us for redemption. Our sponsor has agreed to waive its right to receive liquidating distributions if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the requisite time period. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares, they will be entitled to receive liquidating distributions with respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the required time period.

Manner of Conducting Redemptions
 
On August 10, 2017, we held a special meeting of shareholders to approve the Business Combination. At such meeting, the Business Combination and related proposals were approved. In connection with the meeting, 3,841,131 of our public shares were validly presented to us for redemption.
 
Many blank check companies would not be able to consummate our initial business combination if the holders of the company’s public shares voted against a proposed business combination and elected to redeem more than a specified maximum percentage of the shares sold in such company’s initial public offering, which percentage threshold has typically been between 19.99% and 39.99%. As a result, many blank check companies have been unable to complete business combinations because the amount of shares voted by their public shareholders electing redemption exceeded the maximum redemption threshold pursuant to which such company could proceed with our initial business combination. Since we have no such specified maximum redemption threshold, our structure is different in this respect from the structure that has been used by many blank check companies. However, in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. Furthermore, the redemption threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial business combination. In such case, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares and the related business combination. The Merger Agreement with Borqs requires that, unless waived by mutual agreement of the parties, the amount in the Pacific trust account, together with the proceeds from the Backstop or any Commitment Investment, shall be no less than $24,000,000.
 
Limitation on redemption rights upon consummation of our initial business combination if we seek shareholder approval
 
Our memorandum and articles of association provides that a public shareholder, individually or together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to consummate our initial business combination, particularly in connection with our initial business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. We will resolve any disputes relating to whether a public shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” either by requiring certifications under the penalty of perjury to such effect by public shareholders or via adjudication in court.

Permitted purchases of our securities by our affiliates
 
Our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior to or following the consummation of our initial business combination. Such a purchase would include a contractual acknowledgement that such shareholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. Although very unlikely, our initial shareholders, officers, directors and their affiliates could purchase sufficient shares so that the initial business combination may be approved without the majority vote of public shares held by non-affiliates. It is intended that purchases will comply with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, which provides a safe harbor for purchases made under certain conditions, including with respect to timing, pricing and volume of purchases. As discussed above, in connection with the Business Combination, our sponsor agreed to purchase up to $24.0 million of Pacific ordinary shares through the Backstop, although our sponsor is entitled, at its sole election, to purchase additional Pacific ordinary shares in excess of such $24.0 million Closing Proceeds requirement.
 
The purpose of such purchases would be to (1) increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or (2) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of the business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the consummation of an initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.
 
As a consequence of any such purchases, the public “float” of our ordinary shares may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain the listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange following consummation of a business combination.
 
Tendering share certificates in connection with redemption rights
 
We will require our public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have up to two days prior to the vote on the business combination to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.
 
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
 
The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders’ vote on our initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him to deliver his certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an “option window” after the consummation of the business combination during which he could monitor the price of the company’s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he could sell his shares in the open market before actually delivering his shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the shareholder meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the consummation of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery at or prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.

--

 

Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date of the shareholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.
 
If the Business Combination is not consummated, we will not have sufficient time to try to consummate our initial business combination with a different target before our expiration date of August 21, 2017.
 
Redemption of public shares and liquidation if no initial business combination
 
We must complete the Business Combination by August 21, 2017. If we are unable to consummate the initial Business Combination by August 21, 2017, we will, as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than five business days thereafter, distribute the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable and less interest earned thereon that is released to us), pro rata to our public shareholders by way of redemption and cease all operations except for the purposes of winding up of our affairs. This redemption of public shareholders from the trust account shall be effected as required by function of our memorandum and articles of association and prior to any voluntary winding up, although at all times subject to the Companies Act.
 
Following the redemption of public shares, we intend to enter “voluntary liquidation” which is the statutory process for formally closing and dissolving a company under the laws of the British Virgin Islands. Given that we intend to enter voluntary liquidation following the redemption of public shareholders from the trust account, we do not expect that the voluntary liquidation process will cause any delay to the payment of redemption proceeds from our trust account. In connection with such a voluntary liquidation, the liquidator would give notice to creditors inviting them to submit their claims for payment, by notifying known creditors (if any) who have not submitted claims and by placing a public advertisement in at least one newspaper published in the British Virgin Islands newspaper and in at least one newspaper circulating in the location where the company has its principal place of business, and taking any other steps he considers appropriate to identify the company’s creditors, after which our remaining assets would be distributed. As soon as the affairs of the company are fully wound-up, the liquidator must complete his statement of account and make a notificational filing with the Registrar. We would be dissolved once the Registrar issues a Certificate of Dissolution.
 
Our sponsor has agreed to waive its redemption rights with respect to its founder shares and private units if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the applicable period.
 
However, if our sponsor, or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquire public shares after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to redemption rights with respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the required time period. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our rights or warrants, which will expire worthless in the event we do not consummate our initial business combination by August 21, 2017. We will pay the costs of our liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account or interest earned on the funds held in the trust account. However, the liquidator may determine that he or she requires additional time to evaluate creditors’ claims (particularly if there is uncertainty over the validity or extent of the claims of any creditors). Also, a creditor or shareholder may file a petition with the BVI court which, if successful, may result in our liquidation being subject to the supervision of that court. Such events might delay distribution of some or all of our remaining assets.
 
Additionally, in any liquidation proceedings of the company under British Virgin Islands law, the funds held in our trust account may be included in our estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any such claims deplete the trust account we may not be able to return to our public shareholders the liquidation amounts payable to them.
 
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be $10.52. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors, which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. The actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than approximately $10.52, plus interest (net of any taxes payable).

Although we seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, Mr. Jian Tu, our Chairman, agreed that he will be liable to us, if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below $10.40 per share, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, Mr. Tu will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. However, Mr. Tu may not be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our other officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. We have not independently verified whether Mr. Tu has sufficient funds to satisfy his indemnity obligations. We believe the likelihood of Mr. Tu having to indemnify the trust account is limited because we will endeavor to have all vendors and prospective target businesses as well as other entities execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account.
 
In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below $10.40 per share and Mr. Tu asserts that he is unable to satisfy any applicable obligations or that he has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against Mr. Tu to enforce his indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against Mr. Tu to enforce his indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, due to claims of creditors, the actual value of the per-share redemption price may be less than $10.40 per share.
 
We seek to reduce the possibility that Mr. Tu will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Mr. Tu will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have access to up to $319,312 (as of June 30, 2017) not placed in the trust account, and the interest income earned on the balance of the trust account (net of taxes payable) with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $20,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors.
 
If we are deemed insolvent for the purposes of the Insolvency Act (i.e. (i) we fail to comply with the requirements of a statutory demand that has not been set aside under section 157 of the Insolvency Act; (ii) execution or other process issued on a judgment, decree or order of a British Virgin Islands Court in favor of a creditor of the company is returned wholly or partly unsatisfied; or (iii) either the value of the company’s liabilities exceeds its assets, or the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due), then there are very limited circumstances where prior payments made to shareholders or other parties may be deemed to be a “voidable transaction” for the purposes of the Insolvency Act. A voidable transaction would include, for these purposes, payments made as “unfair preferences” or “transactions at an undervalue”. A liquidator appointed over an insolvent company who considers that a particular transaction or payment is a voidable transaction under the Insolvency Act could apply to the British Virgin Islands Courts for an order setting aside that payment or transaction in whole or in part.
 
Additionally, if we enter insolvent liquidation under the Insolvency Act, the funds held in our trust account will likely be included in our estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any insolvency claims deplete the trust account you may not be able to return to our public shareholders the liquidation amounts due them.
 
Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of a redemption of the public shares prior to any winding up in the event we do not consummate our initial business combination by August 21, 2017 or if they redeem their shares in connection with an initial business combination that we consummate. In no other circumstances shall a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above.

Employees
 
We currently have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they devote in any time period varies based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
 
Our units, ordinary shares, rights and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
 
We are required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to have our internal control procedures evaluated. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, although if our annual gross revenue exceeds $1.07 billion, our non-convertible debt issued within a three year period or revenues exceeds $1 billion, or if the market value of our ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of our second fiscal quarter, we would cease to be an “emerging growth company” as of the following fiscal year.
