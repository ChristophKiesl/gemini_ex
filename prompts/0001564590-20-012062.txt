Overview
 
We are a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company focused on developing novel therapies to activate macrophages in the fight against cancer. We founded Forty Seven based on the insight that blocking CD47, a key signaling molecule that is overexpressed on cancer cells, renders tumors susceptible to macrophages. By harnessing macrophages, we believe that our lead product candidate, magrolimab (formerly known as 5F9), can transform the treatment of cancer. Magrolimab has demonstrated promising activity in multiple Phase 1b/2 clinical trials in which we have treated over 400 cancer patients with solid or hematologic tumors. In March 2020, Forty Seven entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Gilead Sciences, Inc., which is expected to close during the second quarter of 2020.
 
We are also preparing to advance two additional investigational compounds into clinical testing. FSI-174, an anti-cKIT antibody, is being developed alone or in combination with magrolimab as a novel, all-antibody conditioning regimen to address the limitations of current stem cell transplantation conditioning regimens. FSI-189, an anti-SIRPα antibody, is being developed for the treatment of cancer, as well as certain non-oncology conditions, including transplantation conditioning.

We focus our efforts on targeting the CD47 pathway as a way to engage macrophages in fighting tumors. Macrophages function as first responders, swallowing foreign and abnormal cells, including cancer cells, and mobilizing other components of the immune system including T cells and antibodies. Cancer cells use CD47, a “don’t eat me” signal, in order to evade detection by the immune system and subsequent destruction by macrophages. Overexpression of CD47 is common to nearly all types of tumors including myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS, acute myelogenous leukemia, or AML, Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, or NHL, colorectal cancer, or CRC, gastric cancer, lung cancer, and ovarian cancer with overexpression correlating with poor prognosis in many of these cancers. Despite the central role of macrophages as cell-eating scavengers and first responders, the pharmaceutical industry is only beginning to bring this key group of cells into the fight against cancer.
 
Our company was founded in 2014 by leading scientists at Stanford University who uncovered the fundamental role of CD47 in cancer evasion. Preclinical work performed in the laboratory of our co-founder, Irving L. Weissman, at Stanford University and at Forty Seven demonstrated that: 
  
• | Blocking the CD47 “don’t eat me” signaling pathway leads to elimination of many types of tumors and increased survival;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Boosting an “eat me” signal found on cancer cells using therapeutic antibodies results in a synergistic effect with blocking CD47;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increasing “eat me” signal expression on cancer cells through cytotoxic and chemotherapeutic agents like azacitidine, which is synergistic with blocking CD47; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Macrophages digest cancer cells in a process called phagocytosis and present tumor-specific antigens that can activate T cells against the cancer, thus creating the potential for synergy with T cell checkpoint inhibitors.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our lead product candidate, magrolimab, is a humanized IgG4 subclass monoclonal antibody against CD47 that is designed to interfere with recognition of CD47 by the SIRPα receptor on macrophages, thus blocking the “don’t eat me” signal. The design of magrolimab, combined with our proprietary dosing regimen, overcomes the toxicity limitations of previously tested anti-CD47 therapies developed by others. Across all study populations, magrolimab has been well tolerated with no maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, observed in any study despite dosing up to 45 mg/kg. The most common treatment-associated effects observed to date were the expected CD47-mechanism-based effects on red blood cells, which led to a temporary and reversible anemia. Other reported treatment-related adverse events include infusion reactions, headache, fatigue, chills, fever and nausea. The majority of these adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and were generally easily managed. To date, there are no approved therapies that target the CD47 checkpoint of the innate immune system.

The targeting of CD47 to make cancer cells susceptible to macrophages, a component of the innate immune system, is analogous to the approach that has been applied with checkpoint inhibitors and T cells, a component of the adaptive immune system. Since their introduction in 2011, T cell checkpoint inhibitors have become frontline therapies for certain cancers and we estimate that they generated over $22 billion in sales in 2019. Despite the success of T cell checkpoint inhibitors, these therapies have been shown to be effective only in a subset of tumors, highlighting the need for additional therapies. Similar to the way cancer cells overexpress programmed death-ligand 1, or PD-L1, to avoid attack by T cells, cancer cells overexpress CD47 as a way to avoid destruction by macrophages. We believe targeting CD47 represents a compelling and analogous approach.
 
Recent Updates
 Merger Agreement
 
On March 1, 2020, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or Merger Agreement, with Gilead Sciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation, or Parent, and Toro Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, or Purchaser (or together with Parent, Gilead), pursuant to which we agreed to be acquired by Gilead in an all-cash transaction for an approximate value of $4.9 billion. On March 10, 2020, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, Purchaser commenced a tender offer, to acquire all of our outstanding shares of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, at a price of $95.50 per share, to be paid net to the seller in cash, without interest and subject to any required withholding of taxes, upon the terms and conditions described in the Offer to Purchase, as amended or supplemented, and in the accompanying Letter of Transmittal, as amended or supplemented (together with the Offer to Purchase, the Offer). The consummation of Purchaser’s pending Offer is subject to certain conditions, including the tender of shares representing at least one more than 50% of the total number of our shares of common stock outstanding at the time of the expiration of the Offer, the expiration or termination of the waiting period (or any extension thereof) applicable to the Offer under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and other customary conditions. The Merger Agreement provides, among other things, that following the consummation of the Offer and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, and other applicable law, Purchaser will merge with and into the Company, the separate existence of Purchaser will cease and the Company will continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (such merger, the Merger) and together with the Offer, the Proposed Transaction. We expect the Merger to close during the second quarter of 2020, subject to the regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions described above and in the Merger Agreement.
 
Additional information about the Proposed Transaction is set forth in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC.
 Key Clinical and Regulatory Events in 2019
 In early December 2019, we presented updated clinical data from our ongoing trial evaluating magrolimab in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of MDS and AML in an oral presentation at the 61st American Society of Hematology, or ASH, Annual Meeting. The new results showed that the combination of magrolimab and azacitidine is highly active and well-tolerated in patients with MDS and AML.
 Our Phase 1b trial is designed to evaluate magrolimab in combination with azacitidine in untreated patients with higher risk MDS and untreated patients with AML, who are ineligible for induction chemotherapy. All patients received a 1 mg/kg priming dose of magrolimab, coupled with intrapatient dose escalation, to mitigate on-target anemia. Patients were then treated with full doses of azacitidine and a magrolimab maintenance dose of 30 mg/kg once weekly.
 As of the data cutoff of November 18, 2019, 62 patients had been treated with the combination in the Phase 1b portion of the trial, including 35 patients with MDS and 27 patients with AML.
 As of the data cutoff, 46 patients were evaluable for response assessment, including 24 patients with untreated higher-risk MDS and 22 patients with untreated AML, who are ineligible for induction chemotherapy.

• | In higher-risk MDS, the overall response rate, or ORR, was 92%, with 12 patients (50%) achieving a complete response, or CR, eight patients (33%) achieving a marrow CR and two patients (8%) achieving hematologic improvement. Additionally, two patients (8%) achieved stable disease.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In untreated AML, the ORR was 64%, with nine patients (41%) achieving a CR, three patients (14%) achieving a CR with complete blood count recovery, or CRi, and one patient (5%) achieving a morphologic leukemia-free state, or MLFS. Additionally, seven patients (32%) achieved stable disease, or SD, and one patient (5%) had progressive disease.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The median time to response among MDS and AML patients treated with the combination was 1.9 months.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | No median duration of response or overall survival has been reached for either MDS or AML patients, with a median follow-up of 6.4 months (range 2.0 to 14.4 months) for MDS and 8.8 months (range 1.9 to 16.9 months) for AML.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Mutational analyses are ongoing to correlate subgroups with response. Seven of nine (78%) evaluable TP53 mutant AML patients achieved an objective response, with 44% achieving CR and 33% achieving CRi. TP53 mutations are often associated with a poor prognosis and patients with TP53 mutant disease are refractory to existing therapies. In AML patients who achieved an objective response, a significant increase in CD4 and CD8 T cell infiltration was observed in the bone marrow while on therapy, demonstrating that magrolimab and azacitidine can induce an adaptive T cell response.
 As of the data cutoff, the combination of magrolimab and azacitidine was well-tolerated, with no evidence of increased toxicities compared to azacitidine alone. Adverse events (AEs) were consistent with prior clinical experience. No deaths were observed in the first 60 days on combination treatment and only one patient out of 62 (1.6%) discontinued treatment due to a treatment-related AE.
 We achieved alignment with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, on the final design of our potentially registration-enabling clinical development program for magrolimab in higher-risk MDS. In December 2019, the FDA granted Orphan Drug designation to magrolimab for the treatment of MDS. Based on recent interactions under a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, we now plan to continue enrolling patients in our ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial with an amended protocol, and to initiate a Phase 3 randomized control trial, or RCT, ENHANCE, to evaluate the combination of magrolimab and azacitidine compared to azacitidine alone in the second quarter of 2020. This approach provides two distinct opportunities to achieve an accelerated approval, with a potential Biologic License Application, or BLA, submission expected as early as the fourth quarter of 2021.
 We have amended the protocol for our ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial to evaluate dosing every two weeks, and remain on track to complete enrollment of approximately 90 patients in the third quarter of 2020. ENHANCE, which will initiate in the second quarter of 2020, will enroll approximately 180 patients, randomized 1:1 to receive magrolimab and azacitidine or azacitidine alone. We expect to present updated data from our ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial in mid-2020. For both studies, the primary endpoint will be CR rate and duration of response, and either study could serve as the basis for an accelerated approval. ENHANCE will have an adaptive design, such that it can be extended to include additional patients evaluated for a longer period of time for overall survival benefit in support of a potential full approval based on maturing data in the ongoing Phase 1b trial. Additionally, given the decision to design ENHANCE as an RCT with standard, well-validated endpoints, the SPA process is no longer required.
 We plan to continue to enroll additional patients with TP53 mutant disease in the ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial, with potential future regulatory interactions to be considered pending analysis of the maturing data. Updated data from our Phase 1b clinical trial will be presented in mid-2020.
 Also at the 61st ASH annual meeting, we presented in a poster session preclinical proof-of-concept data for our novel all antibody conditioning regimen, comprised of FSI-174, its anti-cKIT antibody, and magrolimab, its anti-CD47 antibody. Preclinical studies in a non-human primate model showed that the combination of FSI-174 and magrolimab significantly depleted hematopoietic stem cells from the bone marrow, with no dose limiting toxicities.

Our novel all antibody condition regimen seeks to address the limitations of current stem cell transplantation, or SCT, conditioning regimens, which utilize chemotherapy and/or radiation to kill HSCs and make space for transplanted cells. These regimens are highly toxic, induce immune suppression and may require hospitalization. Numerous comorbidities are often observed, including severe infections, impaired brain development, infertility, endocrine dysfunction, secondary malignancies and organ damage. As a result, many patients are ineligible for, or choose not to undergo, SCT.
 In the preclinical data presented at ASH, FSI-174 demonstrated binding affinity to both human and NHP cKIT receptors, and induced phagocytosis as well as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, FSI-174 was well-tolerated when administered to NHPs as a single agent, with no dose-limiting toxicities. The no-observed-adverse-effect level was established at 50 mg/kg, the highest dose tested.
 When administered together, FSI-174 and magrolimab demonstrated a synergistic benefit, promoting the highest level of phagocytosis of cKIT expressing target cells and inducing significant HSC depletion nine days after infusion compared to placebo. As expected, there were no changes in blood cell counts over the course of the study, with no cytopenias observed with either monotherapy or combination treatment. These pharmacodynamic and NHP data demonstrate the specificity and safety of FSI-174 and magrolimab, and reveal a window for SCT where the cKIT antibody is washed out, but the depletion of HSCs is sustained long enough to enable the transplantation of donor HSCs.
 We believe that a safe, well-tolerated conditioning regimen may substantially broaden the population eligible for SCT, potentially expanding its use for a wide range of genetic blood disorders, as well as for autoimmune diseases, leukemias and lymphomas.
 In September 2019, we entered into a research collaboration with bluebird bio, Inc. (“bluebird”) to pursue clinical proof-of-concept for our novel antibody-based conditioning regimen, FSI-174 (anti-cKIT antibody) plus magrolimab (anti-CD47 antibody), with bluebird’s ex vivo lentiviral vector hematopoietic stem cell (LVV HSC) gene therapy platform. This collaboration will focus initially on diseases that have the potential to be corrected with transplantation of autologous gene-modified blood-forming stem cells.
 
In March 2020, we announced a research collaboration with Rocket Pharmaceuticals to pursue clinical proof-of-concept for Forty Seven’s novel antibody-based conditioning regimen, FSI-174 (anti-cKIT antibody) plus magrolimab (anti-CD47 antibody), with Rocket’s ex vivo lentiviral vector hematopoietic stem cell (LVV HSC) gene therapy, RP-L102. The initial collaboration will evaluate this treatment regimen in Fanconi Anemia (FA), a genetic disease that affects patients’ capacity to produce blood cells and is associated with an increased risk of leukemia and other neoplasms. RP-L102, Rocket’s gene therapy approach for FA, involves treatment with patients’ own gene-corrected blood forming stem cells (hematopoietic stem cells, or HSCs). 
 Our Development Pipeline  
 We are conducting clinical trials using magrolimab as monotherapy and in combination with other approved cancer therapies in a wide variety of tumors, including both solid and hematological cancers. Our clinical trials are investigating multiple types of CD47 combination therapies: magrolimab with chemotherapeutic agents, magrolimab with tumor targeting antibodies and magrolimab with T cell checkpoint inhibitors, in a wide variety of tumors, including both solid and hematological cancers. We have treated over 400 patients across programs with magrolimab both as a monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy and cytotoxics like azacitidine, tumor targeting antibodies such as rituximab and cetuximab, and checkpoint inhibitors. While the primary goal of our trials has been to demonstrate safety, we have also observed early signs of clinical activity in multiple tumor types. These signs include patients with partial and complete responses, as well as patients with “stable disease.” We use standard clinical assessment criteria to evaluate the growth or reduction in existing tumor size, within set parameters, as well as growth of new tumors and metabolic activity. Broadly stated, “stable disease” indicates a growth or reduction in tumor size that is insufficient to meet the definitions of either progressive disease or partial or complete response. In contrast, patients with partial or complete responses have substantial reductions in tumor size.

Additional Pipeline Programs
 Forty Seven is developing a broad pipeline of additional programs, which take advantage of the CD47/SIRPα pathway as a rich target for engaging macrophages. FSI-174, an anti-cKIT antibody, is being developed in combination with magrolimab as a novel, all-antibody conditioning regimen to address the limitations of current stem cell transplantation conditioning regimens. FSI-189, an anti-SIRPα antibody, is being developed for the treatment of cancer, as well as certain non-oncology conditions including transplantation conditioning.
 The following table summarizes our development programs, target indications and current stages of development.
 
Scientific Background 
 The Role of Macrophages in the Treatment of Cancer 
 The innate and adaptive components of the human immune system form a complex organization of tissues, cells and proteins that serve to protect the body from invading pathogens. For the body to mount an effective response to a foreign cell or a cancer cell, the innate and adaptive immune systems must generally work in concert. 
 Macrophages, a key component of the innate immune system, serve as a first line of immune defense and initiate an immune response based on non-specific signals of foreign or abnormal cells. Macrophages also play a key role in alerting cells of the adaptive immune system to the presence of potential targets such as cancer cells. By making cancer cells susceptible to macrophages, we believe that our therapeutic candidates can be effective both as a monotherapy and in combination with other immunotherapies, such as the PD-1/PD-L1-directed and CTLA-4-directed checkpoint inhibitors. 
 The Role of Macrophages in the Innate and Adaptive Immune Response 
 The innate immune system, of which macrophages are a key component, serves as the first line of immune defense. Macrophages specialize in engulfing and digesting cellular debris, foreign substances, invading microorganisms and other cells. Macrophages determine what to attack by recognizing certain “eat me” signals common to pathogens or cancer cells.

Macrophages also play a key role in alerting highly-specialized cells of the adaptive immune system to the presence of potential targets, including cancer cells. Although these highly specialized adaptive immune cells take longer to mobilize, they are capable of providing long-term, effective protection against specific antigens and, importantly, can recall antigens to which they have previously been exposed. As first responders, macrophages swallow the abnormal cells in a process called phagocytosis, digest them and recruit and activate the second line of defense, the adaptive immune system. 
 Interfering with Suppression of Immune Signaling Pathways 
 A critical capability of both the innate and adaptive immune systems is the ability to distinguish cells that are normally found in the body from foreign invaders. Components of both immune systems rely on the presence of certain surface proteins on cells that serve as markers for normal cells to prevent immune attacks. For the innate immune system, CD47 is expressed on cells throughout the body and functions as a “don’t eat me” signal to prevent attack by macrophages. Similarly, for the adaptive immune system, PD-L1 expression prevents attack by T cells. 
 Recent developments in the field of immuno-oncology have demonstrated that interfering in the PD-L1-based immune suppression system allows the adaptive immune system to attack cancer cells, resulting in significant reduction in tumor burden and increasing overall survival in some cancers. These therapies are generally referred to as checkpoint inhibitors and include both therapies that target PD-1 or PD-L1 such as nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab and avelumab as well as therapies such as ipilimumab that target another checkpoint known as CTLA-4. These agents, all of which target the adaptive immune system, have resulted in remarkable efficacy in some patients and, as of March 2020, were the focus of 1,701 active clinical trials. 
 To date, there have been no therapies approved that target the CD47 checkpoint of the innate immune system. Preclinical data have demonstrated that binding by a CD47 antibody increases antigen presentation by macrophages and stimulates the development of anti-tumor cytotoxic T cell responses. We believe that by targeting CD47 and activating the macrophage and other components of the innate and adaptive immune system, we can create a new class of therapies with the potential to treat multiple types of solid and hematological tumors. 
 The below table outlines our macrophage-focused approach targeting the innate immune system as compared to T cell checkpoint inhibitors targeting the adaptive immune system. 
 
The Role of CD47 in the Treatment of Cancer 
 There are two opposing mechanisms that macrophages rely on to determine whether to attack a cell: one set of markers found on some cells, including bound IgG and calreticulin, triggers an “eat me” signal; the other, centered around CD47, found on both healthy cells as well as many cancer cells, sends a “don’t eat me” signal. This “don’t eat me” signal is essential to prevent macrophages from attacking. Macrophages recognize CD47 through a receptor, SIRPα, that can specifically bind to CD47. Binding of SIRPα receptors on macrophages to CD47 on cancer cells prevents macrophages from attacking and digesting these cancer cells. Macrophages only remove cells whose balance of “eat me” signals outweigh the CD47 “don’t eat me” signals. 
 
9

Nearly all types of tumors overexpress CD47 as a way to avoid the innate immune system. Sending this “don’t eat me” signal prevents the initial attack by macrophages and other phagocytic cells. Because these cancer cells are not digested, the macrophages cannot present components of the cancer cells to the adaptive immune system thereby preventing the activation of T cells that could specifically target them. Expression of CD47 by cancer cells can thus render these cells invisible to innate immune recognition. Interfering with CD47 binding to SIRPα has the potential to activate an immune response to cancer cells that is upstream of current checkpoint inhibitors that target PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA-4. As shown in the following figure the overexpression of CD47 in many types of cancer has been demonstrated by a variety of scientific techniques. 
 
Overexpression of CD47 is associated with poor prognosis in multiple cancers including AML, gastric cancer, lung cancer, NHL and ovarian cancer. In CRC patients with tumors containing high levels of macrophages and low levels of CD47 have increased long-term survival. 
 The progression from normal cell to cancer cell involves changes in genes and/or gene expression that can subvert normal cellular control mechanisms, and overexpression of CD47 represents an important checkpoint allowing the cancer cells to survive. In animal models, CD47-blocking antibodies have been shown to inhibit human cancer growth and metastasis by enabling the phagocytosis of cancer cells. CD47-blocking antibodies have been shown to exhibit potent synergy with tumor targeting monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, cetuximab and trastuzumab. Thus, we believe CD47 has a strong potential as a therapeutic target for the treatment of a variety of cancers. 
 10

Magrolimab Monotherapy 
 In our monotherapy trials, magrolimab treatment demonstrated biological responses including a confirmed objective response and multiple cases of stable disease in Phase 1 patients with refractory AML, as of October 2019. In biologic responders, defined as a reduction in bone marrow blasts, we confirmed the presence of macrophages in tumor tissues and we observed that other components of the immune system, including T cells, had been recruited. 
 We also investigated magrolimab as a monotherapy in ovarian cancer and other solid tumors. In a Phase 1 trial of magrolimab, we observed confirmed partial responses in 2 out of 21 evaluable patients in a cohort with ovarian cancer receiving either 20 mg/kg or higher doses of magrolimab, as of April 2018. Both were heavily pre-treated patients failing seven or more previous treatment regimens. One of these patients had a durable partial response of more than six months in duration. We believe the signals from these monotherapy trials have been encouraging. However, we have determined that the limited responses in these late stage patients are not adequate for us to initiate a trial of magrolimab as a single agent aimed at supporting registration by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and we are now focused on combination approaches that have a strong scientific rationale and that are backed by preclinical data. 
 Magrolimab in Combination with Chemotherapeutic Agents 
 We are also exploring a combination of azacitidine, a chemotherapeutic agent, with magrolimab in patients with untreated AML and myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS. We have shown in preclinical studies that azacitidine induces “eat me” signals on AML cells which leads to enhanced phagocytosis when combined with magrolimab. These results were presented at the 2018 American Society of Hematology meeting. 
 We are conducting a Phase 1b trial of magrolimab with azacitidine in untreated AML and MDS patients to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy.  
 In early December 2019, we presented updated clinical data from our ongoing trial evaluating magrolimab in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of MDS and AML in an oral presentation at the 61 st  American Society of Hematology, or ASH, Annual Meeting. The new results showed that the combination of magrolimab and azacitidine is highly active and well-tolerated in patients with MDS and AML.
 Our Phase 1b trial is designed to evaluate magrolimab in combination with azacitidine in untreated patients with higher risk MDS and untreated patients with AML, who are ineligible for induction chemotherapy. All patients received a 1 mg/kg priming dose of magrolimab, coupled with intrapatient dose escalation, to mitigate on-target anemia. Patients were then treated with full doses of azacitidine and a magrolimab maintenance dose of 30 mg/kg once weekly.
 As of the data cutoff of November 18, 2019, 62 patients had been treated with the combination in the Phase 1b portion of the trial, including 35 patients with MDS and 27 patients with AML.
 As of the data cutoff, 46 patients were evaluable for response assessment, including 24 patients with untreated higher-risk MDS and 22 patients with untreated AML, who are ineligible for induction chemotherapy.
 
 
• | In higher-risk MDS, the overall response rate, or ORR, was 92%, with 12 patients (50%) achieving a complete response, or CR, eight patients (33%) achieving a marrow CR and two patients (8%) achieving hematologic improvement. Additionally, two patients (8%) achieved stable disease.

• | In untreated AML, the ORR was 64%, with nine patients (41%) achieving a CR, three patients (14%) achieving a CR with complete blood count recovery, or CRi, and one patient (5%) achieving a morphologic leukemia-free state, or MLFS. Additionally, seven patients (32%) achieved stable disease, or SD, and one patient (5%) had progressive disease.

Mutational analyses are ongoing to correlate subgroups with response. Seven of nine (78%) evaluable TP53 mutant AML patients achieved an objective response, with 44% achieving CR and 33% achieving CRi. TP53 mutations are often associated with a poor prognosis and patients with TP53 mutant disease are refractory to existing therapies. In AML patients who achieved an objective response, a significant increase in CD4 and CD8 T cell infiltration was observed in the bone marrow while on therapy, demonstrating that magrolimab and azacitidine can induce an adaptive T cell response.
 As of the data cutoff, the combination of magrolimab and azacitidine was well-tolerated, with no evidence of increased toxicities compared to azacitidine alone. Adverse events, or AEs, were consistent with prior clinical experience. No deaths were observed in the first 60 days on combination treatment and only one patient out of 62 (1.6%) discontinued treatment due to a treatment-related AE.
 Based on our application summarizing the early MDS/AML trial data, the FDA granted Fast Track designations to magrolimab for the treatment of both MDS and AML Based on the encouraging early clinical data and feedback from a Type A meeting with the FDA, we believe a single-arm trial design may be sufficient to support the approval of magrolimab in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of naïve (1st line) intermediate to very high risk MDS patients. 
 We plan to expand our current Phase 1b trial, with weekly 30 mg/kg dosing for the first eight weeks and biweekly dosing beginning in week nine, to accrue a total of 91 patients.  We anticipate completing enrollment of this trial in the third quarter of 2020.  In addition, we plan to initiate a second trial of magrolimab plus azacitidine in untreated intermediate to very high risk MDS patients.  This Phase 3 randomized study “ENHANCE” plans to accrue a total of 180 patients to support potential full U.S. and ex-U.S. approval. Dosing in this trial will be weekly 30 mg/kg dosing for the first eight weeks and biweekly dosing beginning in week nine.  The primary endpoints of the study are expected to be complete response rate and durability of response.  This trial is expected to begin enrollment in the first half of 2020.  Based on ongoing data from the Phase 1b trial , we intend to evaluate and determine whether to file for Breakthrough Therapy Designation.  Based on chemistry manufacturing controls, or CMC, and BLA enabling studies, the earliest we expect we can submit our BLA will be in the fourth quarter of 2021. 
 We are also exploring a combination of azacitidine with magrolimab in untreated AML patients with TP53 mutations.  As of November 2019, in our Phase 1b trial of magrolimab with azacitidine in untreated AML patients with a TP53 mutation, 9 patients had been evaluated and 7 (78%) have had an objective response during the study.  In 4 (44%) of these patients, we observed a complete response. 
 
Magrolimab in Combination with Tumor Targeting Antibodies 
 
We are also pursuing multiple trials of magrolimab in combination with tumor targeting antibodies in order to test the synergistic potency of these combinations. We believe that we can enhance the effect of magrolimab on cancer by using tumor targeting antibodies that bind to cancer cells and present an “eat me” signal to macrophages. Hence, we are combining magrolimab with tumor targeting antibodies such as rituximab and cetuximab. Based on our preclinical research and on publications by academic groups, we believe that this combination of an “eat me” signal by these antibodies and the blocking of a “don’t eat me” signal by magrolimab could be highly effective. 
 
We are conducting a Phase 1b/2 combination trial using magrolimab and rituximab in patients with relapsed and refractory NHL. As of May 2019, 97 patients with refractory NHL were evaluable for response assessment including 59 patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, 35 patients with follicular lymphoma, or FL, and 3 patients with marginal zone lymphoma.  In the 97 patients in Phase 1b/2, 44 (45%) have had an objective response during the dose finding study of magrolimab in combination with rituximab. In 18 (19%) of these patients, we observed a complete response, an uncommon therapeutic finding for such a heavily pre-treated population.   In the same study as of May 2019, out of 59 DLBCL patients in Phase 1b/2, 21 (36%) had an objective response and 9 (15%) had a complete response. 
 
In November 2018, the Phase 1b NHL findings were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Based on our application summarizing the early NHL trial data, in April 2018, the FDA granted Fast Track designations to magrolimab for the treatment of relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL.

Based on feedback from a Type C meeting with the FDA in May 2019, we believe a single-arm trial design may be sufficient to support the approval of magrolimab plus rituximab in heavily pretreated relapsed or refractory DLBCL patients, defined as ≥ 2 prior lines of therapy.  
 
We plan to initiate a potential registrational trial of magrolimab plus rituximab in DLBCL in the first half of 2020, and to report interim efficacy data by the fourth quarter of 2020. We anticipate this trial will enroll approximately 100 patients with advanced forms of DLBCL using refined patient eligibility criteria based on our Phase 1 and 2 trials. The dosing regimen for the trial is anticipated to be 30 mg/kg for the first eight weeks and biweekly dosing beginning in week nine. The primary endpoints of the study are expected to be objective response rate, including both complete and partial responses, and durability of response. The anticipated efficacy follow up in this trial will be six months. In parallel with the foregoing, we continue to evaluate biomarkers for potential predictive value, which could enable advancement into earlier lines of treatment.
 
We have also evaluated opportunities to advance magrolimab in combination with rituximab for patients with indolent lymphoma.  As of May 2019, 38 patients with indolent lymphoma had been evaluated in Phase 1b/2 and 23 (61%) had an objective response during the dose finding study of magrolimab in combination with rituximab. In 9 (24%) of these patients, we observed a complete response.  Based on our application summarizing the early indolent lymphoma data, in April 2018, the FDA granted Fast Track designations to magrolimab for the treatment of relapsed and/or refractory FL.
 
In addition, we are evaluating magrolimab with other combinations in DLBCL. In February 2019, we dosed our first patient in an expansion cohort of our magrolimab 003 NHL Phase 1 trial with a combination of magrolimab plus rituximab with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin. We anticipate enrolling up to 26 patients into this cohort. We anticipate sharing data from this cohort in the second half of 2020. 
 
In May 2019, we announced a clinical trial collaboration with Acerta Pharma, AstraZeneca’s hematology research and development center of excellence, to evaluate the triple combination of magrolimab and rituximab with CALQUENCE (acalabrutinib), an inhibitor of Bruton Tyrosine Kinase, in patients with DLBCL. We will supply magrolimab and Acerta will conduct the study. 
 
We are conducting a Phase 1b/2 trial of magrolimab with cetuximab in patients with CRC to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy. As of November 2019, 30 KRASwt (wild type) CRC patients have been evaluated and 2 (6.7%) have had an objective response.  In addition, 40 KRASm (mutant) patients have been evaluated with 0 objective response but 45% had stable disease. While our data did not support a registrational approach, it has informed us about important translational elements for our future study considerations.  
 Magrolimab Combinations with Checkpoint Inhibitors 
 
We believe there is a strong rationale to combine magrolimab and T cell checkpoint inhibitors and we have combination clinical trials in both solid and hematological tumors. Magrolimab induces a potent anti-tumor T cell response by enabling macrophages to ingest cancer cells and present antigens derived from these cancer cells to T cells. Thus, we believe the combination of a T cell checkpoint inhibitor with magrolimab is likely to further enhance an anti-tumor T cell response and to further mobilize both the innate and adaptive immune systems to eliminate cancer. 
 
In early 2018, we announced clinical trial collaboration and supply agreements with two pharmaceutical companies to combine magrolimab with PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors, while retaining full economic rights to our products. Pursuant to these agreements, we are conducting clinical trials with Merck KGaA on the combination of magrolimab with BAVENCIO (avelumab) in ovarian cancer patients; and with Genentech, Inc., a member of the Roche Group, on the combination of magrolimab and TECENTRIQ (atezolizumab) in patients with bladder cancer and in patients with AML.  
 
In April 2019, we announced an extension of our clinical trial collaboration agreement with Genentech to also evaluate magrolimab in combination with rituximab and TECENTRIQ in patients with DLBCL. We will supply magrolimab, and Merck KGaA and Genentech will supply their respective drug products for these trials. 
 
13

In January 2020, we announced results from our Phase 1b combination study of magrolimab with avelumab in ovarian cancer patients.  As of November 2019, 24 ovarian cancer patients have been evaluated and 0 have had an objective response although 10 (42%) had stable disease. While our data did not support a registrational approach, it has informed us about important translational elements for our future study considerations.
 Key Clinical and Regulatory Events Expected in 2020 
 
We expect to provide updates from our ongoing clinical trials at major medical meetings throughout the year. We have submitted an investigational new drug, or IND, application for FSI-174 to the FDA 
and had planned on initiating our Phase 1 clinical trial of FSI-174 in healthy volunteers in the first quarter of 2020
. However, this timeline has been delayed due to the widespread impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and expect to re-evaluate the timing of potential trial initiation in the second quarter of 2020. Similarly, we plan to submit an IND application for FSI-189 to the FDA during the first quarter of 2020 and we plan to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of FSI-189 in the second quarter of 2020, subject to any further delays or impact on our clinical trial programs due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
We also expect to initiate a single-arm, registration-enabling trial evaluating the combination of magrolimab and rituximab DLBCL patients who have failed at least two prior lines of therapy in the second quarter of 2020.  MDS/AML and DLBCL will be the focus for our current development efforts going forward. We do not expect to continue or expand our trials in colorectal and ovarian cancer.
 License and Collaboration Agreements 
 Exclusive (Equity) Agreement with The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University 
 In November 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Stanford under which we obtained a worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicenseable license under certain patents, know-how and other intellectual property, including rights associated with the composition of matter of magrolimab, to develop, manufacture and commercialize products for use in certain licensed fields, the scope of which would include the application of the licensed intellectual property in oncology. The license granted to us in the agreement is exclusive, subject to certain pre-existing non-exclusive or exclusive rights that Stanford granted to third parties with respect to certain categories of the licensed patents in certain fields of use and retained rights by Stanford and all other non-profit institutions to use and practice the licensed patents and technology for internal research and other non-profit purposes. 
 In consideration for the rights granted to us under the agreement, we paid Stanford non-refundable license fees totaling $200,000, reimbursed Stanford for past patent expenses totaling approximately $933,000 and in November 2016 we issued to Stanford 1,000,160 shares of our common stock. In addition, we are obligated to pay Stanford ongoing patent expenses and an annual license maintenance fee ranging from $20,000 to $70,000, depending on the year, which will be creditable against any royalties payable to Stanford in any such year following the first commercial sale of licensed products under the agreement. We are required to make milestone payments up to $5.6 million in respect of the first three licensed products that successfully satisfy certain clinical and regulatory milestones in the United States, major European countries and Japan. The first clinical milestone payment of $75,000 was paid to Stanford in February 2018, recognizing the initiation of the Phase 2 trial of magrolimab in NHL. We also agreed to pay Stanford tiered royalties on a specified percentage of net sales made by us, our affiliates and our sublicensees of licensed products at rates ranging from a low-to-high single digit percentage, subject to certain reductions and offsets, with the royalty rate on magrolimab reaching a high single digit percentage when its net sales exceed $3 billion. To the extent we enter into any sublicensing agreements granting rights to any of the licensed patents to a third party, other than the right to make, have made, use or sell licensed products on behalf of us or our affiliates, we will be required to pay Stanford a low-to-mid double digit percentage of all non-royalty income received from such sublicensees, which decreases based on our level of investment in the licensed products or licensed services and their stage of development. Our license, on a product-by-product and country-by country basis, shall become royalty-free and fully paid-up upon the later of (i) the date on which the last valid claim included in the licensed patents expires and (ii) the ten year anniversary of the first commercial sale of the licensed product. 
 We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the inventions covered by the licensed patent rights. We are also required to achieve certain specified milestones by specified times, provided that an extension of such timelines can be obtained upon mutual agreement by the parties. 
 14

Stanford retains sole responsibility for the prosecution and maintenance of certain patents relating to SIRPα, upon consultation with us. We are responsible for the prosecution and maintenance of the other licensed patents, at our expense and using commercially reasonable efforts, but Stanford retains final approval of such matters. Except for the patents prosecuted and maintained by Stanford, we have the first right to enforce the licensed patents, at our expense. 
 We may terminate the license at any time for any reason with at least 30 days’ written notice to Stanford. Stanford may terminate the license if we enter into an insolvency-related event or in the event of our material breach of the agreement or other specified obligations therein, in each case, that remains uncured for 30 days after the date that we are provided with written notice of such breach by Stanford. In addition, if we fail to achieve any specified diligence milestone by the specified time, Stanford has the right to terminate our license solely with respect to the applicable licensed products for which the milestone was not achieved, which could include magrolimab. Our obligations to pay royalties that are accrued or accruable will survive any termination. 
 Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement with Merck KGaA 
 In January 2018, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with Ares Trading S.A., a subsidiary of Merck KGaA, to evaluate the safety, tolerability and clinical activity of magrolimab combined with Merck KGaA’s cancer immunotherapy, avelumab, a fully humanized monoclonal antibody targeting PD-L1, in a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with ovarian cancer. Pursuant to the agreement, we will act as the sponsor of the study and will hold the regulatory filings relating to the study. We will supply magrolimab and Merck KGaA will supply avelumab for the study, and we and Merck KGaA will jointly pay for the cost of the study. We will conduct the study under the supervision of a joint combination study committee comprised of an equal number of representatives from each of Merck KGaA and us. 
 Under the terms of the agreement, we own the rights to any inventions or discoveries arising from the study that relate solely to magrolimab. Merck KGaA owns the rights to any inventions or discoveries arising from the study that relate solely to avelumab. Both parties will jointly own the rights to inventions or discoveries relating to magrolimab and avelumab in combination. Each party has the sole right to prosecute and maintain patents relating to its solely owned inventions or discoveries, and we will be primarily responsible for, upon consultation with Merck KGaA, the prosecution, maintenance and defense of patents relating to jointly owned inventions or discoveries. We and Merck KGaA each have the first right to initiate legal action to enforce patents relating to jointly owned discoveries where the alleged infringement or misappropriation results from the development or sale of magrolimab or avelumab, respectively. 
 During the course of the agreement and for 90 days after our delivery of the final clinical study report to Merck KGaA, we agreed to work exclusively with Merck KGaA for any trials testing magrolimab in combination with an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody in the specific field of ovarian cancer. In addition we have an option to initiate an additional study under the agreement to evaluate magrolimab and avelumab in combination in patients with a different cancer indication or another indication that may be agreed by the parties, which Merck may elect to co-fund at its discretion. 
 
The agreement will expire after 90 days following our provision of the final clinical study report to Merck KGaA. We and Merck KGaA each have the right to terminate the agreement in the event of an uncured material breach of the agreement by the other party. In addition, each party may terminate the agreement upon its own reasonable good faith determination (i) that the study presents a safety risk or (ii) that it is required to be terminated for medical, scientific, legal or regulatory reasons, or if an applicable regulatory authority takes any action that prevents the supply of its respective compound for use in the study. If Merck KGaA terminates the agreement for medical, scientific, legal or regulatory reasons relating to avelumab, we will be able to continue any study that is ongoing as of the effective date of termination. 
 15

Master Combination Study Agreement with Genentech, Inc. 
 In November 2017, we entered into a master clinical trial collaboration agreement with Genentech to evaluate the safety, tolerability and clinical activity of magrolimab combined with Genentech’s cancer immunotherapy, atezolizumab, a fully humanized monoclonal antibody targeting PD-L1, in two separate Phase 1b clinical trials (in patients with bladder cancer and AML, respectively). Pursuant to the agreement, we will supply magrolimab for the studies and will partially reimburse Genentech for its costs in connection with the bladder cancer study, and Genentech will supply atezolizumab for the studies and be solely responsible for all of its costs in connection with the AML study. Genentech will conduct the studies under the supervision of a joint development committee comprised of representatives of both parties. 
 Under the terms of the agreement, we own the rights to any inventions or discoveries arising from the study that relate solely to magrolimab. Genentech owns the rights to any inventions or discoveries arising from the study that relate solely to atezolizumab. Both parties will jointly own the rights to inventions or discoveries relating to magrolimab and atezolizumab in combination, without the right to assign or license any patents that relate to such jointly owned rights to third parties unless necessary for the research, development or commercialization of products utilizing the combination of magrolimab and atezolizumab. Additionally, each party grants the other a non-exclusive, worldwide, fully-paid, perpetual, sublicenseable license to research, develop and commercialize combinations of magrolimab and atezolizumab. Genentech does not receive any rights from us to research, develop or commercialize magrolimab except in combination with atezolizumab and we do not receive any rights from Genentech to research, develop or commercialize atezolizumab except in combination with magrolimab. Each party has the sole right to prosecute, maintain and enforce patents relating to its solely owned inventions or discoveries, and we and Genentech shall jointly prosecute, maintain and enforce patents relating to jointly owned inventions or discoveries. 
 As part of the agreement, we agreed to notify Genentech if we intend to commence discussions with a third party regarding an agreement to commercialize magrolimab in combination with a PD-L1 or PD-1 antagonist. Following such notice, we may not execute any such agreement until the earlier of 30 days following the date of such notice and Genentech’s written confirmation that it does not intend to discuss with us a similar commercial arrangement. 
 The agreement shall expire after the later of (i) five years after its effective date and (ii) the expiration, termination or completion of all studies being performed under the agreement. We and Genentech each have the right to terminate the agreement in the event of a material breach of the agreement by the other party that remains uncured for 30 days after the date that such party is provided with written notice of such breach. In addition, subject to certain discussion obligations and limitations, each party may suspend or terminate a study under the agreement if, based on its review of the study data and other related information, such party determines that the study presents a safety risk or if an applicable regulatory authority withdraws authorization to conduct such study or takes any action that prevents the supply of magrolimab or atezolizumab for use in the study. 
 Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement with Eli Lilly and Company 
 In August 2016, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with Eli Lilly and Company and its subsidiary ImClone LLC, collectively Lilly, to evaluate the safety, tolerability and clinical activity of magrolimab combined with Lilly’s cancer immunotherapy, cetuximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor, in a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in patients with solid tumors and CRC. Pursuant to the agreement, we will act as the sponsor of the study and will hold the applicable regulatory filings relating to the study. Lilly will supply cetuximab for the study at no cost to us, and we will supply magrolimab and bear all other costs of the study. 
 Under the terms of the agreement, we own the rights to any inventions or discoveries arising from the study that relate solely to magrolimab. Lilly owns the rights to any inventions or discoveries arising from the study that relate solely to cetuximab. Both parties will jointly own the rights to inventions or discoveries relating to magrolimab and cetuximab in combination. Pursuant to the agreement, the prosecution, maintenance and defense of patents relating to jointly owned inventions or discoveries will be managed jointly by the parties. Each party has the first right to initiate legal action to enforce patents relating to jointly owned discoveries depending on whether the alleged infringement or misappropriation results from the development or sale of a biosimilar or interchangeable version of magrolimab, in which case we will have the first right, or cetuximab, in which case Lilly will have the first right. Each party has the sole right to prosecute, maintain and enforce patents relating to its solely owned inventions or discoveries. 
 16

Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will expire after each party completes all of its obligations under the agreement. Each party may terminate the agreement for an uncured material breach by the other party, for certain violations of anti-corruption and other applicable laws by the other party, if such party determines in good faith that the continuation of the study presents an unreasonable safety risk to patients, or if an applicable regulatory authority takes any action that prevents the supply of its respective compound for use in the study. In addition, we can terminate the agreement if we discontinue the development of magrolimab, and Lilly can terminate the agreement if cetuximab is no longer commercially available. 
 Ono Pharmaceutical License and Collaboration Agreement
 
On July 10, 2019, we entered into an exclusive license and collaboration agreement with Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Ono. Under the agreement, we granted Ono an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize magrolimab, our monoclonal antibody against CD47, as well as other anti-CD47 antibodies controlled by us in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the ASEAN countries, or the Ono Territory. We retain all rights to magrolimab and other licensed antibodies outside of the Ono Territory.
 
Under the agreement, the parties will collaborate on the development, manufacturing and commercialization of magrolimab and other licensed antibodies. Each party will be responsible for conducting development and commercialization of licensed antibodies in its respective territory at its own cost. Further, each party will have the right to participate, at its own cost, in global clinical studies of magrolimab and other licensed antibodies conducted by the other party. We will initially be responsible for supplying magrolimab and other licensed antibodies to Ono for development and commercialization within the Ono Territory at Ono’s cost. Ono has the right to elect that such manufacturing activities be transferred to Ono. During the term of the agreement, neither party may manufacture or commercialize any competing products in the Ono Territory.
 
We received a one-time upfront payment from Ono of 1.7 billion Japanese Yen and will be eligible to receive up to an additional 11.2 billion Japanese Yen if specified future development and commercial milestones are achieved by Ono. We are also eligible to receive tiered percentage royalties spanning from the mid-teens to the low-twenties on future net sales of magrolimab and other licensed antibodies in the Ono Territory, subject to certain offsets. Ono’s obligation to pay royalties expires, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, on the later of (1) the expiration of the first regulatory exclusivity for such product in such country, (2) the expiration of the last to expire patent controlled by us that covers the composition of matter of a licensed antibody in such product in such country, or (3) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such product in such country.
 The agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of all of Ono’s royalty obligations, after which Ono’s license shall be fully paid-up. Ono may terminate the agreement on a country-by-country basis for convenience upon 90 days’ prior written notice to us prior to the first commercial sale of the first licensed product in the Ono Territory, or 180 days’ prior written notice after such first sale. Either party may also terminate the agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or insolvency, subject to specified notice and cure periods. In the event of any early termination, all rights in magrolimab and other licensed antibodies will revert to us, subject to certain royalties due to Ono in the case of Ono’s termination for our breach or insolvency.
 bluebird bio, Inc. Research Collaboration Agreement
 In September 2019, we entered into a research collaboration with bluebird bio, Inc., or bluebird, to pursue clinical proof-of-concept for our novel antibody-based conditioning regimen, FSI-174 (anti-cKIT antibody) plus magrolimab (anti-CD47 antibody), with bluebird’s ex vivo lentiviral vector hematopoietic stem cell (LVV HSC) gene therapy platform. This collaboration will focus initially on diseases that have the potential to be corrected with transplantation of autologous gene-modified blood-forming stem cells.
 17

Rocket Pharmaceuticals Research Collaboration Agreement
 
In March 2020, we announced a research collaboration with Rocket Pharmaceuticals to pursue clinical proof-of-concept for Forty Seven’s novel antibody-based conditioning regimen, FSI-174 (anti-cKIT antibody) plus magrolimab (anti-CD47 antibody), with Rocket’s ex vivo lentiviral vector hematopoietic stem cell (LVV HSC) gene therapy, RP-L102. The initial collaboration will evaluate this treatment regimen in Fanconi Anemia (FA), a genetic disease that affects patients’ capacity to produce blood cells and is associated with an increased risk of leukemia and other neoplasms. RP-L102, Rocket’s gene therapy approach for FA, involves treatment with patients’ own gene-corrected blood forming stem cells (hematopoietic stem cells, or HSCs). 
Sales and Marketing 
 Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. We plan to build focused capabilities in the United States and European Union to commercialize our development programs focused on MDS, AML and NHL, where we believe the patient populations and medical specialists for the indications we are targeting are sufficiently concentrated to allow us to effectively promote our product, if approved for commercial sale, with a targeted sales team. In other markets for which commercialization may be less capital efficient for us, we may selectively pursue strategic collaborations with third parties in order to maximize the commercial potential of our drug candidates. 
Manufacturing and Supply 
 We currently do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely for the foreseeable future, on third party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, including Lonza and Northway BiotechPharma, or BTPH, to produce our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. We require that our CMOs produce bulk drug substances and finished drug products in accordance with current cGMPs and all other applicable laws and regulations. We maintain agreements with our manufacturers that include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to our product candidates. 
 We have engaged Lonza to manufacture magrolimab for preclinical and clinical use. Additional CMOs are used to label, package and distribute magrolimab for preclinical and clinical use. We obtain our supplies from these CMOs on a purchase order basis and do not have any long-term commercial supply arrangements in place. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply. For all of our product candidates, we intend to identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient and fill-and-finish services prior to seeking regulatory approval. 
 
In August 2016 and December 2017, we entered into development and manufacturing agreements with Lonza relating to the manufacturing of magrolimab-related products and preclinical testing. The August 2016 agreement was amended in November 2017 to provide for the manufacturing of our other preclinical program related products. In July 2018, we entered into development and manufacturing agreements with BTPH relating to the manufacturing of FSI-174 related products and preclinical testing. For additional details, please see “Management Discussion and Analysis—Contractual Obligations and Commitments” section.
 
Competition 
 The pharmaceutical industry and the immuno-oncology subsector are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary drugs. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any drug candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing treatments and new treatments that may become available in the future. 
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of magrolimab, if approved, are likely to be its efficacy, safety, convenience, pricing and durability. 
 18

We are aware that Celgene Corporation, Trillium Therapeutics, ALX Oncology, Arch Oncology, Surface Oncology, Novimmune, OSE Immunotherapeutics, Innovent, I-MAB BIOPHARMA, Aurigene Discovery Technologies and others are developing drugs targeting the CD47 pathway that may have utility for the treatment of indications that we are targeting.  We are also aware of competing cKIT antibodies being developed for conditioning treatments prior to transplantation by Magenta, Jasper and Amgen/Stanford.
 As noted above, there are existing treatment alternatives in each of the indications we are targeting, and we will face competition from the incumbent drug therapies in each of those markets. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, more convenient, less expensive or with a more favorable label than magrolimab or any other drug that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approvals for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our drug, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Many of the companies against which we are competing, or against which we may compete in the future, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors will also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or that may be necessary for, our programs. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our current and future product candidates, novel discoveries, product development technologies and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing or in-licensing U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, copyright protection, know-how, continuing technological innovation and confidential information to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
 Regardless of the coverage we seek under our existing patent applications, there is always a risk that an alteration to the product or process may provide sufficient basis for a competitor to avoid infringement claims. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before a patent is issued and courts can reinterpret patent scope after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions, including the United States, permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. Moreover, we cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending or any future applications or that any current or future issued patents will adequately protect our intellectual property. 
 As of December 31, 2019, we own seven pending U.S. provisional patent applications, three pending PCT applications, 8 pending U.S. utility patent applications and 15 pending foreign patent applications.  Our portfolio of licensed patents, which we license from Stanford, includes approximately 222 issued patents (36 of which are in the United States) and approximately 120 pending patent applications (about 20 of which are in the United States). These licensed patents are expected to expire between 2029 and 2034 excluding any extension of patent term that may be available. For more information regarding our license agreement with Stanford, please see “Business—License and Collaboration Agreements.” 
 Our patent portfolio licensed from Stanford contains patent families directed to the magrolimab composition of matter and methods of using magrolimab as a monotherapy and in combination with certain other therapeutic compounds, which are comprised of 11 U.S. issued patents, four U.S. patent applications and two granted European patents which have each been validated as national patents in 12 different European countries. These patents are 
 19

subject to retained rights by Stanford to allow academic and non-profit research institutions to practice the licensed technology and patents for non-commercial purposes. In addition, some of these patents are subject to certain pre-existing non-exclusive rights that Stanford has granted to two third parties. In particular, a non-exclusive license to certain patents was granted to a third party in the field of research product sales and diagnostics for use in a flow cytometry platform. Another non-exclusive license to certain patents was granted to a different third party for the use of certain SIRPα proteins, SIRPα fragments and SIRPα fusion proteins as therapeutic agents for use in the therapeutics field. For clarity, we believe that these pre-existing non-exclusive licenses do not relate to magrolimab or our other product candidates or their use in the therapeutic field. These patents are expected to expire between 2029 and 2034 excluding any extension of patent term that may be available. 
 Provisional patent applications are not eligible to become issued patents until, among other things, we file a non-provisional patent application within 12 months of filing of one or more of our related provisional patent applications. If we do not timely file any non-provisional patent applications, we may lose our priority date with respect to our provisional patent applications and any patent protection on the inventions disclosed in our provisional patent applications. While we intend to timely file non-provisional patent applications relating to our provisional patent applications, we cannot predict whether any such patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that provide us with any competitive advantage. 
 Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, utility patents issued for applications filed in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the delay by the USPTO, in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years, the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug or a method for using it may be extended. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. The actual protection afforded by a patent may vary on a product-by-product basis and from country to country and can depend upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
 Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants and any potential commercial partners and collaborators and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have implemented or intend to implement confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our selected consultants and any potential commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 
 Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual or proprietary rights of third parties. The issuance of third-party patents could require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, change our products or processes, obtain licenses to additional third-party patents or other intellectual property or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future products may have an adverse impact on us. Given that patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially longer, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference, revocation, derivation, re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, or opposition proceedings brought by third parties or declared by the USPTO or an equivalent foreign body. 
 20

We have also obtained a sublicense to a family of patent and patent applications owned by Stichting Sanquin Bloedvoorziening, or SSB, and licensed to Synthon Biopharmaceuticals B. V., or Synthon, that encompass certain combination therapies for the treatment of cancer using anti-CD47 antibodies. This family of U.S. and foreign patents includes U.S. Patent No. 9,352,037, or the U.S. ‘037 Patent, the related European Patent No. EP 2 282 772, or the EP ’772 Patent, and its UK counterpart EP (UK) 2 282 772, or the UK ’772 Patent. These patents relate to the treatment of cancer with an anti-CD47 antibody or an anti-SIRPα antibody in combination with certain other antibodies, including rituximab or cetuximab. 
 We are aware of an opposition filed by different third parties against European patent number EP 2 242 512, or the EP ’512 Patent, a European patent that we exclusively in-licensed from Stanford. The EPO opposition proceeding may involve issues including, but not limited to, procedural formalities related to filing the European patent application, priority, and the patentability of the involved claims. The independent claims of EP ’512 patent was maintained in the EPO Opposition Division on November 15, 2018. The opponents have appealed the EPO Opposition Division decision to the Technical Boards of Appeal at the EPO. The outcome at the Technical Boards of Appeal cannot be predicted.  In addition, one or more of the third parties that have filed oppositions against the EP ’512 Patent or other third parties may file future oppositions or other challenges, in Europe or other jurisdictions, against other patents that we in-license or own. 
 We are also aware of an opposition filed by different third parties against European patent number EP 208,864 or the EP 864 patent, another European patent that we exclusively in-licensed from Stanford. The EPO opposition proceeding may involve issues including, but not limited to, procedural formalities related to filing the European patent application, priority, and the patentability of the involved claims. The claims of EP ’864 patent were maintained in the EPO Opposition Division on November 6, 2019. The opponents may appeal the EPO Opposition Division decision to the Technical Boards of Appeal at the EPO. The outcome at the Technical Boards of Appeal cannot be predicted.  In addition, one or more of the third parties that have filed oppositions against the EP ’864 Patent or other third parties may file future oppositions or other challenges, in Europe or other jurisdictions, against other patents that we in-license or own. 
 In addition, oppositions have been filed against European patent numbers EP 3 056 514, EP 3 056, 515 and EP 2 970,493 (the “EP 514 patent”, “EP 515 patent” and the “EP 493 patent”), all exclusively licensed from Stanford.   These EPO opposition proceeding also involve issues including, but not limited to, procedural formalities related to filing the European patent application, priority, and the patentability of the involved claims.  In addition, one or more of the third parties that have filed oppositions against the EP ’512 Patent or other third parties may file future oppositions or other challenges, in Europe or other jurisdictions, against other patents that we in-license or own.    The loss of priority for, or the loss of, the EP ’512 Patent, the EP 864 patent, the EP 493 patent, the EP 514 patent, the EP 515 patent or our other patents could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

 Government Regulation 
 The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of products, such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our product candidates. 
 21

United States Government Regulation 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceuticals under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. 
 
The process required by the FDA before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s GLP regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with GCP requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a BLA in the case of a biologic such as magrolimab;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA.
--+------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies 
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
Clinical Trials 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human patients under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research patients provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website. 
 22

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1 clinical trial: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 clinical trial: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 clinical trial: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Each of Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Marketing Approval 
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of a BLA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard BLA to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes 12 months from the date the BLA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, as amended and reauthorized, certain applications or supplements must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. 
 The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools. 
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all BLAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept a BLA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the biologic is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. 
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 23

Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. 
 After evaluating the BLA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the application and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Pharmaceuticals manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program user fee requirements for any marketed products, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an application. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. 
 In addition, pharmaceutical manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 24

 
• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
 Orphan Drug Designation in the United States 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA or supplemental BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the name of the sponsor, identity of the drug or biologic and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review or approval process, but does provide certain advantages, such as a waiver of PDUFA, fees, enhanced access to FDA staff and potential waiver of pediatric research requirements. 
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the application user fee. A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
 In May 2016, the FDA granted orphan drug designation in the United States for magrolimab for the treatment of AML. In December 2019, the FDA granted orphan drug designation in the United States for magrolimab for the treatment of MDS.  We intend to pursue orphan drug designation for magrolimab in additional indications, as well as for potential other future product candidates, in the United States and in the European Union as we deem it appropriate. Even if we obtain orphan drug designation for a product candidate, we may not obtain orphan exclusivity and that exclusivity may not effectively protect the drug or biologic from the competition of different drugs or biologics for the same condition, which could be approved during the exclusivity period. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA is required to facilitate the development and expedite the review of pharmaceutical products that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a fast track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND for the product candidate. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days after receipt of the sponsor’s request. 
 In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have more frequent interactions with the FDA, the agency may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s PDUFA review period for a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the BLA is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the agency believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
 25

Products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures.
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Sales of our drug candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which such products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage or reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors decide which therapies they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Non-governmental third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any drug candidates that we develop will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. Each payor determines whether or not it will provide coverage for a therapy, what amount it will pay the manufacturer for the therapy, and on what tier of its formulary it will be placed. The position on a payor’s list of covered drugs, or formulary, generally determines the co-payment that a patient will need to make to obtain the therapy and can strongly influence the adoption of such therapy by patients and physicians. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our drug candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our drug candidates could reduce physician usage of our drug candidates, once approved, and negatively impact our sales, results of operations and financial condition. 
Other Healthcare Laws 
 Because of our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors, we will also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we will conduct our business, including our clinical research, proposed sales, marketing and educational programs. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil penalties, criminal penalties, or both. The U.S. laws that may affect our ability to operate, among others, include: HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, which is a federal law governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; certain state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts; the federal healthcare programs’ Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent; federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. 
 26

In addition, many states have similar laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, to the extent that our product is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws. 
 Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may result in lower reimbursement for our products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of our products. 
 Orphan Drug Designation in the European Union 
 In accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1999 on orphan medicinal products, a medicinal product may be designated as an orphan medicinal product if: (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the incentives derived from orphan medicinal product status, would not generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. 
 Products authorized in the European Union as orphan medicinal products are entitled to 10 years of market exclusivity. The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product during the 10-year period of market exclusivity for the same therapeutic indication at any time if: 
  
• | the second applicant can establish in its application that its product, although similar to the orphan medicinal product already authorized, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan medicinal product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan medicinal product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In November 2015, the EMA granted orphan drug designation in the European Union for magrolimab for the treatment of AML. 
 U.S. Healthcare Reform 
 Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may result in lower reimbursement for our products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of our products. 
 
For example, implementation of the Affordable Care Act has substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research. 
 27

There remain judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. In January 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Affordable Care Act have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, included a provision which repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Additionally, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the Affordable Care Act-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax.  Congress will likely consider other legislation to replace elements of the Affordable Care Act. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. It is unclear how this decision, future decisions, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the Affordable Care Act.   
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, in August 2011, then-President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction, which triggered the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of, on average, 2% per fiscal year through 2029 unless Congress takes additional action. Recently, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. In addition, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2021 includes a $135 billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices, increase competition, lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients, and increase patient access to lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs. In addition, the Trump administration previously released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The Department of Health and Human Services has solicited feedback on some of these measures and has implemented others under its existing authority. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 We expect that additional federal and state, as well as foreign, healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.
