ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Company
 
We were incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company on December 29, 2020 for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar Partnering Transaction with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Report as our “Partnering Transaction.” To date, our efforts have been limited to our organizational activities and activities related to our initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) and the identification and evaluation of prospective acquisition targets for our Partnering Transaction. We intend to effectuate our business combination using cash derived from the proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our shares, debt or a combination of cash, shares and debt.
Our Sponsor
 
Our Sponsor is an affiliate of Corsair Capital, one of the longest-standing private equity investors in the financial and business services industries, having been founded in 1992. Since inception, Corsair Capital has led over $11 billion of investments across its global private equity and infrastructure platforms. As a preeminent financial services specialist, Corsair Capital has developed deep expertise and an extensive network within the global financial and business services industry. The firm invests in high-growth, asset-light businesses that operate at the crossroads of technology transformation and financial services complexity, requiring Corsair Capital’s sectoral knowledge and network to drive value.
 
The Corsair Capital Investment Committee, which includes our Chief Executive Officer, D. T. Ignacio Jayanti, and our Chief Financial Officer and President, Jeremy S. Schein, is comprised of experienced professionals with dedicated financial and business services operating, investing and advisory backgrounds. The Corsair Capital Investment Committee has been investing together for an average of 15 years, with decades of experience in the financial and business services sectors, and has spent the majority of its duration investing through many different macroeconomic and credit cycles.
 
Corporate Information
 
Our executive offices are located at 717 5th Avenue, 24th Floor, New York, New York, and our telephone number is (212) 224-9400. Our corporate website address is https://corsair-capital.com/spac. Our website and the information contained on, or that can be accessed through, the website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference in, and is not considered part of, this Annual Report.
 
 We are a Cayman Islands exempted company. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Law. As an exempted company, we have received a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Law (2018 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations will apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us.
    We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
    


In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
    We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our Initial Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A Ordinary Shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
    Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of any fiscal year for so long as either (1) the market value of our Class A Ordinary Shares held by non-affiliates did not exceed $250 million as of the prior June 30, or (2) our annual revenues did not exceed $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our Class A Ordinary Shares held by non-affiliates did not exceed $700 million as of the prior June 30.
 
Partnering Transaction
 
The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) rules require that our Partnering Transaction must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if permitted, and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount). We refer to this as the 80% of net assets test.
 
We anticipate structuring our Partnering Transaction so that the post-transaction company in which our Public Shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the partnering candidate or candidates. We may, however, structure our Partnering Transaction such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the partnering candidate in order to meet certain objectives of the partnering candidate management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such Partnering Transaction if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the partnering candidate or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the partnering candidate sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the partnering candidate, our shareholders prior to our Partnering Transaction may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the partnering candidate and us in our Partnering Transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all the outstanding capital stock of a partnering candidate. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the partnering candidate. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our Partnering Transaction could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our Partnering Transaction. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a partnering candidate or candidates are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If our Partnering Transaction involves more than one partnering candidate, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all the partnering candidates.
 
We filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our Partnering Transaction.
 



We may pursue a Partnering Transaction opportunity jointly with our Sponsor, Corsair Capital or one or more of its affiliates and/or investors in Corsair Capital or one of its affiliates. Any such parties may co-invest with us in the partnering candidate at the time of our Partnering Transaction, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by issuing to such parties a class of equity or Equity-Linked Securities. Any such issuance of equity or Equity-Linked Securities would, on a fully diluted basis, reduce the percentage ownership of our then-existing shareholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of our Founder Shares, issuances or deemed issuances of Class A Ordinary Shares or Equity-Linked Securities would result in an adjustment to the ratio at which Founder Shares shall convert into Class A Ordinary Shares such that our Initial Shareholders and their permitted transferees, if any, would retain their aggregate percentage ownership at 5% of the sum of the total number of all as-converted Class A Ordinary Shares outstanding upon completion of our Initial Public Offering (including the private placement shares), plus all Class A Ordinary Shares and Equity-Linked Securities issued or deemed issued in connection with the Partnering Transaction, unless the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding Founder Shares agree to waive such adjustment with respect to such issuance or deemed issuance at the time thereof. Neither our Sponsor nor Corsair Capital, nor any of their respective affiliates, have an obligation to make any such investment, and may compete with us for potential Partnering Transactions.
 
Status as a Public Company
 
We believe our structure will make us an attractive Partnering Transaction partner to partnering candidates. As an existing public company, we offer a partnering candidate an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other Partnering Transaction with us. In a Partnering Transaction with us, the owners of the partnering candidate may, for example, exchange their shares of stock in the partnering candidate for our Class A Ordinary Shares (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of Class A Ordinary Shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe partnering candidates will find this method a more expeditious and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical Partnering Transaction process, and there are significant expenses and market and other uncertainties in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, marketing and road show efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a Partnering Transaction with us.
 
Furthermore, once a proposed Partnering Transaction is completed, the partnering candidate will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Following a Partnering Transaction, we believe the partnering candidate would then have greater access to capital, an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders’ interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
 
While we believe that our structure and our management team’s backgrounds will make us an attractive business partner, some potential partnering candidates may view our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek shareholder approval of any proposed Partnering Transaction, negatively.
 
Financial Position
 
With funds available for a Partnering Transaction in the amount of $285,226,827 (assuming no redemptions), we offer a partnering candidate a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our Partnering Transaction using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the partnering candidate to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.
Effecting Our Partnering Transaction
 
General
 
We intend to effectuate our Partnering Transaction using cash from the proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and the private placement of the Private Placement Warrants, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our Partnering Transaction (pursuant to the Forward Purchase Agreement or other Forward Purchase Agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into from time to time), shares issued to the owners of the partnering candidate, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the partnering candidate, or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete our Partnering Transaction with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
 
If our Partnering Transaction is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our Partnering Transaction or used for redemptions of our Class A Ordinary Shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our Partnering Transaction, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
 
We may need to obtain additional financing to complete our Partnering Transaction, either because the transaction requires more cash than what is held in our trust account or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our Public Shares upon completion of the Partnering Transaction, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Partnering Transaction. There are no prohibitions on our ability to issue securities or incur debt in connection with our Partnering Transaction. Other than the Forward Purchase Agreement, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities, the incurrence of debt or otherwise.
 
Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular partnering candidate with which we may combine, we cannot assure Public Shareholders that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a partnering candidate may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely affect a partnering candidate.
 
Sources of Partnering Candidates
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing a Partnering Transaction with a partnering candidate that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, or from completing the Partnering Transaction through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our Partnering Transaction with a partnering candidate that is affiliated with our Sponsor, executive officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm, that such a Partnering Transaction is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
Evaluation of a Partnering Candidate and Structuring of Our Partnering Transaction
 
In evaluating a prospective partnering candidate, we expect to conduct a due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as applicable, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular partnering candidate, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the Partnering Transaction.
 
The time required to select and evaluate a partnering candidate and to structure and complete our Partnering Transaction, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective partnering candidate with which our Partnering Transaction is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another Partnering Transaction. The company will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our Partnering Transaction.
 



Lack of Business Diversification
 
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our Partnering Transaction, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete a Partnering Transaction with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our Partnering Transaction with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

• | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our Partnering Transaction, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Partnering Candidate’s Management Team
 
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective partnering candidate when evaluating the desirability of effecting our Partnering Transaction with that business, our assessment of the partnering candidate’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the partnering candidate cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our Partnering Transaction. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our Partnering Transaction, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our Partnering Transaction. Moreover, we cannot assure Public Shareholders that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular partnering candidate.
 
We cannot assure Public Shareholders that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our Partnering Transaction.
 
Following a Partnering Transaction, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the partnering candidate. We cannot assure Public Shareholders that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
 
 Facilities

 
We currently sub-lease our executive offices at 717 5th Avenue, 24th Floor, New York, NY from our Sponsor. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees
 
We currently have two executive officers, D.T. Ignacio Jayanti and Jeremy S. Schein. Neither D.T. Ignacio Jayanti nor Jeremy S. Schein is obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our Partnering Transaction. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a partnering candidate has been selected for our Partnering Transaction and the stage of the Partnering Transaction process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our Partnering Transaction.
